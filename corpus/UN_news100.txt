Kyoto Treaty becomes legally binding on February 16
''November 18 2004, Nairobi.'' The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] has announced that the [[w:Kyoto Treaty|Kyoto Treaty]], which its signatories claim will counter the [[w:greenhouse effect|greenhouse effect]] and global climate changes, will take effect on February 16, 2005. 

The treaty could not be made legally binding to those countries who signed it earlier, the BBC reports, because they did not make up for the required 55% of the world's emission of greenhouse gases. Last month, [[w:Russia|Russia]] announced they would sign the treaty, pushing that percentage to 55%. Andrei Denisov, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, handed [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] the official papers today.

Several industrialized nations around the world have refused to ratify the Kyoto Treaty, in particular the [[w:United States of America|United States of America]] and [[w:Australia|Australia]]. The governments of both countries argue that signing the protocol would cause an estimated 3% decline in GDP, and thus stagnation of their economies, while resulting in only small total greenhouse gas reductions worldwide. The also point out that other major nations, notably China, are extempt from the treaty provisions.

Dem. Republic of Congo prepares to confront Rwanda
'''December 3, 2004'''

The [[w:Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]] may be preparing to have its troops face those of [[w:Rwanda|Rwanda]], which have allegedly been sighted by United Nations personnel on the Congo side of the border. 

The United Nations is attempting to mediate the conflict but both sides of the conflict appear to be pursuing independent policies, with Congo's president accusing Rwanda of being predatory, and Rwandan president refusing to back down from the threat of pursuing Rwandan rebels across Congo's territory.

Aid pledges rise; Japan promises 500,000,000 USD
{{date|January 1, 2005}}

In an abrupt about-face, the world's wealthiest nations have begun pouring funding into the Earthquake/Tsunami damaged region. Promised funds have doubled in the past 24 hours, to nearly 2 Billion [[w:United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] (USD).

== [[w:Japan|Japan]] tops the [[w:United States|U.S.]] ==

After the U.S. increased it's funding donation to 350 million USD, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi announced a half-billion dollar donation on Saturday, Jan. 1. [[w:People's Republic of China|China]] has promised 60.5 million USD, after Japan and the U.S., the [[w:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and
[[w:Sweden|Sweden]] for largest single-nation donation.
[[w:Norway|Norway]] increased it's funding donation to 180 million USD

== [[w:United Nations|U.N.]] warns of delays ==

Despite the encouraging promises, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Indonesia chief, Michael Elmquist, warned that logistics of securing the funds, purchasing supplies and shipping them to stricken regions will take time, possibly weeks. In the meantime, the confirmed death toll will continue to climb, as may deaths due to dehydration, disease, and starvation.

UN 'optimistic' on tsunami aid effort
{{date|January 3, 2005}}

The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] (UN) emergency relief coordinator [[w:Jan Egeland|Jan Egeland]] has said that he is increasingly optimistic about the relief efforts under way in tsunami-stricken countries. However, he cautions that there are still major problems getting aid to the [[w:Indonesia|Indonesia]]n province of Aceh. The [[w:BBC|BBC's]] Rachel Harvey, stationed in provincial capital Banda Aceh, reports that the area has been completely cut off for a week. He also said that logistical bottle necks that hampered speedy delivery of aid were improving, with new coordination centers set up in Aceh, near the epicenter of the earthquake, and [[w:Jakarta|Jakarta]]. Regional officials warn that despite improvements, some places may not receive aid for up to two weeks.

United States helicopters, based on a US aircraft carrier stationed off the coast of western Aceh, have begun dropping food and supplies into isolated parts of Aceh province. About 12 [[w:SH-60 Seahawk|Seahawk]] helicopters are involved in the operation. "We are relying on the helicopter system because that is the only way we can reach the most remote areas," said Michael Elmquist, head of the UN disaster relief operation in Indonesia. According to the World Food Programme, some helicopters are unable to touch down because mobs of people run towards them for help. Supplies are often thrown out of the helicopters to the crowd below.

UN proposes world-wide natural disaster warning system
{{date|January 20, 2005}} 

The [[w:United Nations|UN]] has proposed the formation of the International Early Warning Programme (IEWP), with the suggestion that it would have greatly limited the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean [[w:earthquake|earthquake]] and [[w:tsunami|tsunamis]].

The system would analyse data from all over the world and rapidly transmit warnings. It would also feature a population training element, to make sure people know what to do upon hearing warnings or to teach them to recognize danger signs.

“This new programme will help bring safety, security and peace of mind,” stated the Director of the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), Sálvano Briceno, at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) in Kobe, Japan.

The system, first proposed two years ago, has been given new impetus by the recent disaster in the Indian Ocean. It will warn against many types of natural disaster including wildfires, floods, droughts, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis.

The Program will see many existing UN programs working together, including the World Food Program, the World Meteological Program, the [[w:UNESCO|UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), and the [[w:UNEP|UN Environment Programme]] (UNEP). One third of the people the World Food Program helps are the victims of natural disasters.

The system will be built around better, more open flow of regional data and the formulation of local warning plans.

Kofi Annan notes high turnout in 2005 Iraq elections
[[Image:Iraq-election2005-V.jpg|thumb|An Iraqi citizen, turning his head to protect his identity, proudly displays the indelible ink on his finger as proof he has voted in Iraq's first free election.]]
{{Byline|date=January 31, 2005|location=[[w:New York|New York]], [[w:USA|USA]]}}
[[w:United Nations|UN]] Secretary General [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] has noted that the Iraqi people turned out in large numbers to vote in the January 30 ballot. Voters were deciding who to elect to the 275 seat Transitional National Assembly.

Sporadic violence saw the deaths of 22 people across the country during voting, but attacks by insurgents did not seem to deter voters from exercising their new democratic rights. Annan praised the courage of the people and congratulated the Independent Election Commission of Iraq (IECI) and UN officials for successfully running the poll.

The Secretary General went on to say that the success bodes well for the on-going transition process. The next step will be a referendum in October 2005 on the constitution the Transitional National Assembly will be tasked with drawing up.

In the Out-of-Country Voting Program, 93.6% of Iraqis eligible to vote, did so.

Human rights group critical of US opposition to ICC in Darfur
{{date|February 1, 2005}}

US based {{w|Non-governmental organization|NGO}} {{w|Human Rights Watch}} has criticised the [[United States of America|United States]] attempts to block the [[UN]] {{w|UN Security Council|Security Council}} from referring atrocities in the {{w|Darfur conflict}} region to the {{w|International Criminal Court}} (ICC). The US favours setting up an ad hoc tribunal instead. HRW claims that the resulting delay will lead to the loss of more innocent lives. 

The US has long opposed the ICC, because of concerns over politically motivated prosecutions of it's citizens.  

A report prepared by a five member UN commission noted "killing of civilians, enforced disappearances, destruction of villages, rape and other forms of sexual violence, pillaging and forced displacement, throughout Darfur", and secretly named alleged war criminals that should go before the ICC. 

{{w|Pierre-Richard Prosper}}, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes, said "We don't want to be party to legitimizing the ICC."  

In the last two years in the {{w|Darfur}} region more than 70,000 people have been killed, and over 2 million displaced.

== US opposition to ICC ==
The United States, which signed but did not ratify the statute during the {{w|Bill Clinton}} administration, withdrew its support soon after {{w|George W. Bush}} assumed the presidency. It signed the ICC Statute at the last minute, primarily so that it could continue to take part in negotiations on the rules of procedure for the new court, in an attempt to obtain an exemption for U.S. nationals taking part in UN-sponsored peacekeeping missions--as several other countries were able to do. The U.S. fears that American soldiers and political leaders may be subject to frivolous or politically motivated prosecutions.

U.S. opponents of the ICC maintain that in cases where the U.S. failed to act quickly enough to prevent disaster the U.S. has been criticized for allowing genocide to occur (e.g. {{w|Rwanda}}:[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2000/07/09/stories/0109000c.htm ''"Rwanda: U.S., France blamed for genocide"''],[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0406-08.htm  ''"Rwanda-US: Intelligence Warned Early of Genocide, New Papers Show"'']); in cases where the U.S. ''has'' acted quickly  they have been criticized and even accused of war crimes (e.g. Yugoslavia, {{w|Somalia}}:[http://agitprop.org.au/stopnato/20000323robyuguard.php  ''"Yugoslavia: US Terrorism"''], [http://www.boycottusa.org/usa_crimes_somalia.htm   ''"American Slaughter of People in Somalia"'']).

Furthermore, opponents contend that the neither the ICC nor the [[United Nations]] has any real power to enforce the extradition of war criminals from signatory states. Therefore, any kind of military action to force compliance would have to be undertaken (in large part) by the U.S., action which would expose U.S. officials to spurious charges of war crimes.

UN says no genocide in Darfur
{{byline|date=February 6, 2005 |location=NEW YORK,United States }} 

A report released by the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] last week said that there is no [[w:genocide|genocide]] in [[w:Sudan|Sudan's]] western region of [[w:Darfur|Darfur]]. 

The report also says that the Sudanese government and its Arab militias had committed crimes against humanity by destroying villages and torturing, killing and raping civilians. According to the report, there is credible evidence that local rebel groups, including the [[w:Sudanese Liberation Army|Sudanese Liberation Army]], are responsible for serious violations of international law which may amount to war crimes.

The government of the United States and aid agencies say genocide is been committed in Sudan.

UN IIC report faults former "Oil-for-Food" director
[[Wikinews:2005/February/3|February 3]], [[Wikinews:2005|2005]]

<div style="float:right">
[[Image:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|200px|[[w:United Nations|United Nations]] building in [[w:New York City|New York City]]]]
</div>
Former [[w:Chairman of the Federal Reserve|U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[w:Paul Volcker|Paul Volcker]] delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the [[w:United Nations|United Nation's]] [[w:Oil for Food program|Oil-for-Food program]] with [[w:Iraq|Iraq]] under [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]], which is sharply critical of the procurement process used and former program director [[w:Benon Sevan|Benon Sevan]].

Volker heads the [[w:Oil for Food program#UN investigation|Independent Inquiry Committee]], an investigation requested by [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] in June, 2004.

Annan has already responded to the report, ordering disciplinary action for Sevan and other UN officials of the former program.

Volker expects the report will go some ways to responding to critics of the UN program. "I think it's important to find out the extent those attacks are justified," he is quoted as saying. "There are obviously problems in the institution and we have identified some of them. But the end of this should be a reformed and stronger U.N., because I believe - and I know the other committee members believe - that the U.N. has an important role to play but it cannot be effective if it is under suspicion all of the time."

Charges that UN officials misused 1.4 billion [[w:US dollar|USD]] of administrative funds are unfair, Volker said. "We do not find evidence that this was a big slush fund," he said. "The money was carefully budgeted. They didn't spend all of the money they had budgeted. They gave some of it back to Iraq."

The Independent Investigation Committee report faulted the contract procurement process which selected Banque Nationale de Paris, Saybolt Eastern Hemisphere BV, and Lloyd's Register Inspection Limite, saying it did not conform to financial and competitive bidding standards. The choices were "clearly affected by political considerations" according to Volker.

Sevan is particularly faulted for personal financial transactions, including $160,000 over 1999-2003 which his lawyer has stated came from an aunt who has since died.

UN board supported Saddam Hussein's regime, says Iraq's ambassador
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.png|thumb|right|United Nations Flag]]
{{byline|date=February 6, 2005 |location=NEW YORK, United States}} 
At UN World Headquarters in [[w:New York|New York]] on Friday, February 4, 2005, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, [[w:Samir Sumaidaie|Samir Sumaidaie]], declared to reporters that the international body of the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] helped the regime of [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]]. This allegation came one day after the former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman [[w:Paul Volcker|Paul Volcker]] delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the United Nation's [[w:Oil-for-Food|Oil-for-Food]] program with [[w:Iraq|Iraq]] under Saddam Hussein. Sumaidaie says he has serious doubts about the role of the former UN [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|secretary-general]] [[w:Boutros Boutros-Ghali|Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] although there is no charge against him in the report.

In an interview with [[w:Voice of America|Voice of America ]] reporter Peter Heinlein, Sumaidaie [http://author.voanews.com/english/figleaf/ramfilegenerate.cfm?filepath=http%3A%2F%2F128%2E11%2E143%2E114%2Fmediaassets%2Fenglish%2F2005%5F02%2FAudio%2Frm%2FHeinleinUN%2DAnnan%2DOil%2DFor%2DFood4UpdateFeb05%2Erm      said[[Image:Loudspeaker.png]]]: "In the early days, the secretariat bent over backwards to please the Saddam regime. At that time it was Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was the Secretary-General. And the report asserts that he tried to please the Saddam government by accommodating its requests which laid the basis for most things that went wrong later.... What's clear to me is that Saddam and his regime were able to manipulate things in such a way as to get what they wanted out of this program."

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Sumaidaie said the inquiry's investigators were ignorant of the UN system and that their allegations were silly.

After being questioned by journalists, the current UN secretary-general [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] said: "Each Secretary-General has to do things his way and in accordance with the circumstances that he finds himself in. I think Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indicated in the report, the environment and the circumstances in which he was taking those decisions and I don't want to second-guess him."

On Friday, Annan said there were some hard knocks in the report and said he would take action promptly: "We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN, so we want to get to the bottom of it."

UN troops accused of rape in Congo; UN staff suspended due to Iraq Oil-for-Food corruption
{{date|February 13, 2005}}

[[w:United Nations|United Nations]] (UN) troops based in the [[w:Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]] face 150 allegations of [[w:rape|rape]] including gang rapes committed against children as young as twelve. 

The UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services reported these crimes which occurred even while investigators were in Congo. The [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General of the UN]], [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] has condemned the soldiers and has banned the peacekeeping troops (those deployed in Congo) from having sex with local residents.

The soldiers are believed to have bribed young starving children with eggs, milk or a few dollars to have sex. There are believed to be at least fifty different soldiers involved. Kofi Annan pledged personally to "root out this problem." The United Nations has 65,000 troops in 16 different locations, with 16,700 UN soldiers and other staff in Congo alone.

Annan also faces serious allegations of impropriety for the UN's $64 billion oil-for-food program which allegedly enriched Annan's relatives, senior officials within the [[w:Russia|Russia]]n and [[w:France|French]] governments and deposed [[w:Iraq|Iraq]]i president [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]]. The UN's own internal inquiry headed by former United States [[w:Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve]] Board chair [[w:Paul Volcker|Paul Volcker]] confirmed misconduct allegations leading to the termination of several senior UN officials.

The [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]], [[w:Rotary International|Rotary International]], the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and [[w:United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]] are leading the Initiative and coordinating a series of overlapping immunization campaigns in the region.

In 2004 [[w:Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[w:India|India]], and [[w:Pakistan|Pakistan]] cut their number of [[w:Polio|Polio]] cases by 45%. In 2005 the goal is to cut the number of cases by 100%.

The three countries are the last in Asia to have endemic polio, and the disease is confined to a small number of regions within the country. Only 186 cases were reported in 2004, down from 336 the previous year.

U.N. reports Afghan opium production is up again
{{date|February 11, 2005}}
<br>
[[Afghanistan]] is the #1 producer of {{w|opium}} in the world &mdash; responsible for 87% of all illicit opium production &mdash; according to reports from the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|Office on Drugs and Crime}} (UNODC), and its opium production has accelerated since the coalition invasion in 2001.

The November 2004 annual reports put out by UNODC show that Afghanistan opium production has been increasing each year since the coalition invasion. The UNODC report for 2004 shows a 64% increase over the previous year in the area of opium production, and a 22% increase in export value for the year({{w|United States dollar|US$}}2.8 billion).

"It could be brought under control with a good dose of law enforcement, which at the moment is lacking," Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of UNODC, said in an interview in 2003 when reports showed an increase in hectares under production of 8% over the previous year. "I believe that the war against terrorism, leaving aside addiction, will not be won unless we control the opium economy of Afghanistan."

Doug Wankel, Counter Narcotics Coordinator at the [[U.S.]] Embassy in {{w|Kabul}}, said the opium industry in Afghanistan is financing terrorism in an interview with USA Today. "It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism. ... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."

Calling the data "disheartening," UNODC reported that Afghanistan now produces three-fourths of the world's opium. The report estimated revenues from growing and trafficking to be half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product.

United Nations passes Declaration on human cloning
{{date|March 10, 2005}}
[[Image:UN General Assembly.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The declaration was passed at the UN general assembly]]

A divided [[UN]] [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] has voted to approve a nonbinding statement against all forms of {{w|human cloning}}.

The vote, held Tuesday, came after four years of debate and an end to attempts for an international ban.

In the 191-nation assembly, there were 84 votes in favor of a nonbinding statement, 34 against and 37 abstentions. 

Proposed by Honduras, the statement was largely supported by {{w|Roman Catholic}} countries and opposed by countries with active embryonic stem cell research programs. Many [[Islam]]ic nations abstained.

The ''{{w|UN Declaration on Human Cloning}}'', as it is named, calls for all member states to adopt a ban on human cloning, which it says is "incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life."

The {{w|US}}, which has long pushed for a complete ban, voted in favor of the statement while traditional ally {{w|UK|Britain}}, where {{w|therapeutic cloning}} is legal and regulated, voted against it.

The statement should have no impact on countries that allow therapeutic cloning, such as Britain and South Korea, as it is not legally binding.

"The foes of therapeutic cloning are trying to portray this as a victory for their ideology," Bernard Siegel, a {{w|Florida}} attorney who lobbies to defend therapeutic cloning, said in a {{w|Reuters}} report. "But this confusing declaration is an effort to mask their failure last November to impose a treaty on the world banning therapeutic cloning."

==Breakdown of the vote==

Six-year development framework for Sudan released by UN
[[Image:LocationSudan Africa.png|thumb|Sudan]]
{{date|March 11, 2005}}

The Joint Assessment Mission between the [[w:World Bank|World Bank]] and the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] released on March 9, 2005, a plan for the development of [[w:Sudan|Sudan]] over the six years remaining between January's peace agreement and the vote in 2011, in which southern Sudan will decide whether to break away from the north. The plan, titled "Framework for Sustained Peace, Development and Poverty Eradication in Sudan," describes two phases, the first through 2007, the second through mid-2008. The first phase will focus on emergencies and the repatriation of refugees, while the second will consist of "major infrastructural programs", according to the Sudan Tribune.

While the majority of the $7.8 billion needed for the development described in the plan will come from sources within the country, the plan asks for $2.66 billion from other countries. According to Reuters, the UN's Joint National Transition Team will hold a conference to ask for money in Norway in April.

Kofi Annan unveils UN reform plan
{{date|March 21, 2005}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.png|180px|right|Kofi Annan unveils UN reform plan]]
[[UN]] Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] will formally present a plan this morning to the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] when it meets in [[New York State|New York]] later today. The plan, entitled {{w|In Larger Freedom}}, is part of the UN's attempt to revitalise itself during its sixtieth anniversary year.

If implemented, this plan will be the largest change ever to the international body, calling for the addition of nine members to the [[UN Security Council|Security Council]], and for the creation of a new Human Rights Council to replace the 53-member {{w|United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Human Rights Commission}}.

The [[Canada|Canadian]] ambassador to the UN,  {{w|Allan Rock}}, was the first diplomat to officially respond by saying, "A lot of hard work lies ahead but we are optimistic." {{w|Oxfam}}, [[Amnesty International]], and other {{w|NGO|NGOs}}, have come out in support of the plan.

UN Reform: China, South Korea question seat for Japan on Security Council
{{date|March 23, 2005}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.png|180px|right|UN Reform]]
A [[South Korea]]n official expressed doubts over [[United Nations]] {{w|UN Secretary-General|Secretary-General}} [[Kofi Annan]]'s apparent support for a permanent [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] seat for [[Japan]], and attention has been drawn to widespread mistrust of Japan by [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] &mdash; although the Chinese government has not commented directly against Japan.

Asked to comment on Annan supporting Japan gaining the seat, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jianchao said, "I think reform of the UN Security Council should have its eyes on increasing work efficiency ... and at the same increasing the representation of developing countries."

Four hundred-thousand Chinese have signed an on-line petition opposing Japan's bid, and a poll last year put opposition within China at 95 percent. Resentment still runs high after Japan's invasion of China from 1931 to 1945 led to death or injury of up to 35 million Chinese, and sexual slavery of tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of women in mainland Asia.

The UN reforms currently being discussed are the largest changes since the body's formation 60 years ago.

Last year, Japan, [[Germany]], [[Brazil]], and [[India]] formed a lobby group supporting each other in bids for seats on the influential Security Council. But [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea|South Korea]] oppose Japan gaining a seat, [[Italy]] opposes Germany, [[Pakistan]] opposes India, and [[Mexico]] and [[Argentina]] oppose Brazil.

The [[United States]], [[UK|Britain]], [[France]], [[Russia]], and China are permanent members of the council, with the other 10 seats filled by other countries, selected from regional groups for two-year terms.

UN Security Council approves peacekeepers for Sudan
{{date|March 25, 2005}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.png|180px|right|United Nations flag]]The [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Security Council|Security Council}} approved the deployment of 10,000 peacekeeping troops and 715 civilian police to southern [[Sudan]]. They will monitor a peace plan that ended the country's 21 year long {{w|Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war}}.

The peacekeeping force will enforce a ceasefire agreement between Sudan's {{w|Khartoum}} government and the {{w|SPLA|Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)}}.

Jean-Marie Guehenno, head of UN peacekeeping operations, welcomed the Security Council's unanimous support of the resolution, but warned of "serious political hurdles" and "unprecedented logistical obstacles".

"If security does not improve quickly, the killings and rapes will continue. We must not allow allow this catastrophic scenario to become a foregone conclusion," he said.

Bush nomination to UN post faces bi-partisan problems
[[Image:John Bolton State Dept.jpg|thumb|right|Undersecretary of State [[John R. Bolton]] named North Korea as a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction in a speech at the American Center in Tokyo on Oct. 27, 2004]]
{{date|April 24, 2005}}

[[George W. Bush|George Bush's]] controversial nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, [[John R. Bolton]], seemed stalled as new allegations surfaced in the Senate Committee's second interview. Lawmakers from both parties, particularly [[Democratic Party (US)|Democrats]], express strong reservations.

=== Democrats argue against Bolton ===

"He wants to be our top diplomat at the UN but his life has been something less than diplomatic," {{w|Dick Durbin}}, the number two Democrat in the Senate, said on a Sunday talk show.

"He wants to work with people around the world. And he couldn't work with people in his own office. And he's supposed to be open, as our man at the UN, to ideas from other people," Durbin said.

"He's been a real tyrant when it came to people he worked with, who disagreed with him. This man doesn't have the temperament for this job."

There was no consensus Thursday whether the Senate committee should ask Bolton to return for more questioning. He testified for eight hours and presented a written draft on other questions, but the stream of allegations has only intensified, as well as a characterization of him as a boss who mistreated fellow workers and lost his temper frequently.

Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Bolton would be hobbled in the job because of the allegations raised during the confirmation hearings. Dodd spoke on CBS's "Face the Nation."

Dodd maintains the Democrats raise objections to Bolton because of evidence he twisted intelligence analysis to fit his personal views. He said Bush should consider withdrawing the nomination.

"There are plenty of other good people who embrace his ideological views," Dodd added.  

=== Republicans divided ===

But some Republicans had a differing view. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) thought Bolton's "forceful" personality made him the ideal candidate to lead U.S. efforts to reform the UN. He put little concern into Bolton's alleged personnel problems, saying that Bolton's supposed history of trying to get analysts who disagreed with him fired were unproven. McConnell is the second ranked Senate Republican. He was also speaking on the CBS program.

Lincoln Chafee, Republican Senator of Rhode Island, has said he is "less likely" to vote for the nominee as a result of the questions that are being raised about his credibility. Instead he sought out the opinion of former Secretary of State Colin Powell.

Powell's spokeswoman, Peggy Cifrino, said he returned calls Thursday to senators who wanted to discuss questions that have been raised about Bolton. Powell was the only former GOP secretary of state who did not sign a recent letter endorsing Bolton for the job. It is known that the two did not get along during Powell's tenure in the Bush Administration. Powell's former chief of staff has been quoted by the US press as saying Bolton would make an "abysmal ambassador."

Some Republicans in Congress are doubtful that Bolton will win nomination now that the vote has been pushed back to May 12 to allow more time to investigate his history. Speaking on CNN television Senator Arlen Spector, R-PA, said the odds on Bolton were "too close to call."

=== Bolton criticism of UN ===

Some wondered what Bush's reasoning could be for nominating Bolton for the UN post since Bolton acknowledged saying in 1994 that the UN headquarters in New York "has 38 stories. If it lost ten stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference."

Also in 1994, Bolton said, "There is no such thing as the United Nations. There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that's the United States, when it suits our interest and when we can get others to go along." [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/fedagencies/jan-june05/bolton_3-8.html]"

In response to criticism of these statements at his hearing, Bolton replied, "There's not a bureaucracy in the world that couldn't be made leaner."

=== Presidential support ===

It appears to trained observers that Bush may have to yield his nomination to a Senate rejection. Behind the scenes, Bolton may be facing a question of withdraw or be pushed out. As President Bush asked Senators to support his nominee, Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said he strongly supports Bolton, but "I can't speak for all of (GOP) leadership."

President Bush continues to support his nominee, according to Whitehouse spokespersons.  In an April 20 news briefing, press secretary Scott McClellan said in response to a question whether the Bolton nomination was lost, "No, absolutely not. I think what you're seeing is some Democrats on the committee trumping up allegations and making unsubstantiated accusations against someone the President believes will do an outstanding job at the United Nations. He is someone who has been an effective manager, a strong diplomat who has gotten things done. And I think he's earned the respect of many people that he has worked with because of what he's done....people are playing politics with his nomination....He's exactly the kind of person we need at the United Nations during this time of reform."

On Sunday, White House spokeswoman Christie Parell, said the president is standing by Bolton as his nominee.  "The president believes he's exactly the man needed at the United Nations," she said in reply to Dodd's comments.

Press advocacy groups in Africa are beginning a new campaign to remove "insult laws" from the books that protect political figures from criticism.  The laws, which are found to restrict freedom of expression to varying degrees of severity in 48 out of 53 African nations, result in the imprisonment of many political reporters for what they feel is necessary criticism of their governments.

The campaign was launched on Monday in [[w:Lusaka|Lusaka]], the capital city of Zambia.  The date was chosen so that the workshops would take place on [[w:World Press Freedom Day|World Press Freedom Day]] (Tuesday, May 3).  In the nation of Zambia, to take one example, a three-year jail sentence is prescribed for a journalist who defames or ridicules the President or any other prince.

The laws are supposed to exist to protect the dignity and reputation of public figures.  However, according to some critics, they are used to attack journalists who make personal references to some politicians, and those who allege misconduct or corruption by high public officials, such as heads of state or parliamentarians.

"We want to create awareness of these laws and lobby for their repeal in Africa," said research manager Kandji Kaitira of the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA).  

According to the Zimbabwe ''Daily News'', a number of African media groups are taking part in the effort, including World Press Freedom Committee, the Southern African National Editors' Forum, the Southern African Editors' Forum, the Southern African Journalists' Association, Journalistes en Danger (JED) of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Organisations of the Media in Central Africa, the Media Foundation for West Africa and Media Rights Agenda in Nigeria.

[[w:Kenya|Kenya]] in Africa, and some countries in South America, have already removed such laws from the books. However, in at least one [[w:European Union|European Union]] country, [[w:Poland|Poland]], insulting a head of state remains a crime (see [[w:freedom of speech#Poland|freedom of speech]]), though the January 5 [[2005]] conviction of [[w:Jerzy Urban|Jerzy Urban]] for having insulted [[w:pope John-Paul II|the pope]] could in principle be overturned by the [[w:European Court of Human Rights|European Court of Human Rights]].

== Negativism in coverage of Africa ==

Last month, the result of an unusual study by 11 former African presidents was announced in a [[w:Johannesburg|Johannesburg]] press conference.  The former leaders stated that based on their review of certain American outlets for the past decade (1994-2004), coverage was found to be overwhelmingly negative, crisis-driven and dismissive of Africa's democratic progress.  The result of this one-sidedness, they claim, actually becomes detrimental to further progress being made by Africa.

"Negative perceptions lead to negative outcomes &mdash; lower levels of aid and lower investments," said [[w:Joaquim Chissano|Joaquim Chissano]], one-time president of [[w:Mozambique|Mozambique]], who helped put an end to decades of civil war in his country.

The period was chosen because of a trend they saw toward democracy and free markets during that period in diverse nations.  Chissano said, "Coverage of Africa... is, at best, dismissive of the continent's progress and potential... At worst, coverage disregards recent trends towards democratisation, betraying an almost contemptuous lack of interest in the potential and progress being achieved on the continent," he said.

The ''New York Times'', ''Washington Post'', ''Wall Street Journal'', ''USA Today'' and ''US News and World Report'' were reviewed in the study.

== Ten stories the world should hear more about ==

To focus media awareness on World Press Freedom Day, the U.N. Department of Public Information (DPI) launched a new initiative it calls "Ten Stories the World Should Hear More About".  These are items that in the strongly expressed opinion of the U.N. spokesman, are critical issues which are not receiving adequate attention by the major media, compared to other stories which are focused on almost exclusively, such as Iraq.

Some of the stories concern ongoing conflicts and humanitarian crises to which the U.N. is responding, while others concern underreported good news.  For example:

<blockquote>
"Five: [[w:Tajikistan|Tajikistan]], rising from the ashes of civil war.  Again, you know, we often complain that while the cliche is that 'no news is good news',  when it comes to media and the U.N., 'good news is no news'.  Well, the fact is, here is a good news story, formidable challenges in the aftermath of a deadly civil war, and yet a country that is persisting on the road to peace and recovery &mdash; it hardly gets reported."
</blockquote>

The spokesman concluded:

<blockquote>
"Our staff and the public information staff of the various U.N. agencies are eager to work with you to raise the profile of these topics.  We have summaries available of the story behind each of the ten issues on the list... All of them list contact points from whom you can seek further information.  We've also posted links to more information sources on our website to help you if the list inspires you.  And these are also links to the U.N. officers and agencies concerned with each issue. And if it piques your curiosity sufficiently, we're happy to help by arranging interviews.  The staff of DPI and those of other U.N. offices are committed to working with you to help raise the world's awareness of these and other stories that we believe the world needs to know more about.  I urge you to use the initiative as a resource, as you go about your tough job, the business of covering the news.  After all you are one of the most, perhaps &mdash; we think &mdash; ''the'' most, important source of information about world events."
</blockquote>

The stories are listed on the new [http://www.un.org/events/tenstories/ Ten Stories] space on the U.N. website.

2005 Afghan opium harvest begins
{{date|May 3, 2005}}
[[File:Papaver somniferum 01.jpg|250px|thumb|Opium poppy.{{image|Catherine Giayvia}}]]
Most [[heroin]] sold in [[Europe]] comes from [[Afghanistan]]'s poppies. This past week, the 2005 opium harvest was in full view and going full speed in Afghanistan. The cultivators gathering resin from the crop are operating even near the main road through Kandahar and the farmers are out gathering resin from opium poppies in full view.

Last year 80% of the world's [[opium]] came from Afghanistan and production is up over 239% since 2003, according to U.S. government estimates.  Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of illegal drugs.

In {{w|Super Bowl XXXVI|2002 Super Bowl}} ads, the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House]] sent out the message that "drugs fund terrorists".  Doug Wankel, a former U.S. {{w|Drug Enforcement Administration}} (DEA) official, says the opium industry is "financing terrorism. It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."

"The Bush administration has decided not to destroy the opium crop in Afghanistan," stated a U.S. intelligence official returning from Afghanistan in relation to the 60% smaller 2002 crop. The source, who requested that he not be identified, noted "U.S. forces could destroy the crops using aerial spraying techniques, but no such actions are planned."

U.S. plans to spray the crops were canceled at the request of Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]], who has called for {{w|jihad}} or "holy war", but is concerned that aerial spraying could be harmful to the health of Afghan villagers.  The U.S. claims that the spraying would be safe, but is granting Karzai's request.

Karzai has indicated that he may change his mind if other U.S. strategies fail to halt the opium. Congress budgeted $774 million for anti-drug operations in Afghanistan just this year.

==== Estimating the value of the crop ====

The [[CIA]] reports in ''From Flowers to Heroin that'' it takes 10&nbsp;kg of opium to make 1&nbsp;kg of 90% pure heroin. The CIA states that impurities are introduced into the processed heroin before it hits the street, making the purity of the end consumer product about 40%.  That implies that 10&nbsp;kg of opium makes about 2.25&nbsp;kg of 40% pure heroin.

The Guardian reports that the 2002 opium harvest was 3400 metric tons. Using the conversion supplied by the CIA, 2002's 3400 opium harvest could be converted into 765 metric tons of heroin.  According to the International Narcotics Control Board, the 2003 opium harvest was 3600 metric tons.  Using the estimated 239% increase of the present harvast over 2003, it means that the 2005 harvest is about 8600 metric tons.

The 2002 street price of heroin in the UK was about 60 £ per GRAM, or (assuming the present 1.89 USD to 1 £ exchange) 113.40 USD per GRAM. As the supply goes up the price will come down some, so for this calculation only the 2002 figures will be used. If all the opium harvest is converted into heroin and all of it is sold at the UK street price, the total street value of the harvest is 86.7 billion USD. (765 metric tons x 1000&nbsp;kg/metric ton x 1000 grams/kg x 113.4 USD/gram = about 86.7 billion USD.)  To the extent the 2002 numbers are valid today, the street value of the 2005 harvest should be roughly twice the street value of the 2002 harvest, about 173 billion USD.

To put these numbers in perspective, the total market capitalization of Ford, General Motors and Daimler Chrysler combined is about 76 billion USD. The total market capitalization of Toyota and Honda combined is about 167 billion USD.

==== No Statement by the Financial Action Task Force  ====

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was formed to promote harmonization of international antimoney laundering (AML) laws. Despite the fact that tens of billions of USDs are generated from the Afgan opium harvest alone, the FATF has not added Afghanistan to its blacklist of uncooperative nations.  One has to wonder, therefore, what the poppy farmers are doing with their share of the money that escapes the notice of the banking system and the FATF.

U.S. Senate: U.K. and French politicians were allocated Iraqi oil
{{date|May 12, 2005}}

A [[w:United States|U.S.]] Senate committee, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), released evidence in a probe that purportedly suggests that two [[w:United Kingdom|U.K.]] and [[w:France|French]] politicians received vouchers for millions of barrels of [[w:Iraq|Iraqi]] oil in exchange for their support of [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein's]] regime under the [[w:United Nations|U.N.]] [[w:Oil-for-Food Programme|Oil-for-Food Program]] (OFP).

Under the OFP program, Iraq was allowed to sell its oil rights to whomever it wanted, and at a below-market price. These oil rights could then be re-sold for a higher price, usually between 3 and 30 cents a barrel. U.K. MP [[w:George Galloway|George Galloway]] and French Senate member [[w:Charles Pasqua|Charles Pasqua]] are accused of having these rights allocated to them as a reward for opposing the U.S lead economic sanctions on Iraq. However, no evidence was presented showing that those politicians had received any money benefit out of the scheme.

The PSI committee found Hussien-era documents that appear to show the two politicians received these oil rights. They also heard from officials from the old regime who confirmed the documents.

George Galloway, who won re-election to the [[w:Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] in a surprise victory, is accused of receiving allocations for 20 million barrels of oil. He is also accused of using the Mariam Appeal, a campaign he set up "''to campaign against sanctions on Iraq which are having disastrous effects on the ordinary people of Iraq''" which was best known for flying an Iraqi child to England for Leukemia treatment, to conceal the transfer of 3 million barrels of oil.

Galloway, a member of the new British left-wing anti-war Party, [[w:RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]], won a ferocious campaign for parliament last week in [[w:Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]], east London, where a sizable part of the population is of a Muslim southern Asian origin.

George Galloway won libel suits in the past against the [[w:en:Telegraph|Telegraph]] newpaper which claimed he had accepted bribes from the Iraqi regime. The Senate committee will be holding a further hearing on May 17, and have invited Galloway to attend, where he will be given a seat and a microphone.

Charles Pasqua, currently member of the Senate of France, was in the past [[w:Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], in charge of law enforcement, safety measures and relationships with local governments. His name has been cited in several corruption scandals inside France, though he has not been convicted. He currently heads a small [[w:en:Eurosceptic|Eurosceptic]] party with no representative in the National Assembly, and is generally considered to be somewhat close to Jacques Chirac's [[:w:Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] party, though he has distanced himself from that party from 1998 onwards.

Galloway and Pasqua deny any wrongdoing on their part in the oil-for-food program
{{date|May 17, 2005}}

Following accusations issued by the [[:w:United States Senate|United States Senate]] Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), British Member of Parliament [[:w:George Galloway|George Galloway]] and Senator [[:w:Charles Pasqua|Charles Pasqua]] of France  have vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

'''George Galloway''' declared:
<blockquote>
''I've now had a chance to read the report which was compiled without this Senate committee asking me a single question about these absurd allegations. I repeat once more. I have never traded or benefited from any oil deals with Iraq.''
<p>
''One of the companies named, with ostensible links to me-- Aredio Petroleum-- I have never heard of until today and I have certainly had no dealings with. The other company, Middle East Advanced Semiconductors, was owned by Fawaz Zureikat, who was the chairman of the Mariam Appeal. It is well-known that Mr Zureikat traded with Iraq but he did not do so on my behalf. I have not received a penny piece or any oil voucher from Iraq, directly or indirectly.''
<p>
''You would have thought that natural justice would have demanded that these allegations would have-- must have been!-- put to me, but they haven't been. Senator Joseph McCarthy would have been proud of this committee.''
</blockquote>

On May 17, Galloway appeared before the U.S. senatorial panel and vehemently denied any wrongdoing in a tone seldom used in a senatorial hearing. He accused the U.S. administration of creating a "smoke screen" to divert attention away from the situation in Iraq. He also declared, "The biggest sanctions busters were not me or Russian politicians or French politicians. The real sanctions busters were your own companies with the connivance of your own government." 

Galloway denied receiving any money out of the scheme.  Galloway demanded, "What counts is, where's the money, senator? Who paid me hundreds of thousands of dollars? The answer to that is nobody," while glaring toward U.S. senator [[:w:Norm Coleman|Norm Coleman]] ([[:w:US Republican Party|Republican]] from [[:w:Minnesota|Minnesota]]), according to a New York Times report.

Galloway also accused the US senators, especially senator Coleman, of shoddy standards of justice.  He claimed they have already ruled him guilty, and that they rely on dubious evidence and wrongful or coerced testimonies. 

Galloway declared:
<blockquote>''You have my name on lists provided to you... by the convicted bank robber and fraudster and con man [[w:Ahmed Chalabi|Ahmed Chalabi]], who many people, to their credit, in your country now realize played a decisive role in leading your country into the disaster in Iraq.''
<p>''In these circumstances, knowing what the world knows about how you treat prisoners in [[w:Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib prison]]<sup>1</sup>, in Bagram Air Base [Afghanistan], in [[w:Guantanamo Bay|Guantanamo Bay]] -- including, if I may say, British citizens being held in those places -- I'm not sure how much credibility anyone would put on anything you manage to get from a prisoner in those circumstances.''</blockquote>
<small>1. Alluding to the acknowledged [[w:Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]].</small>

'''Charles Pasqua''' also denies any personal wrongdoing in the case.  Pasqua indicated that he was "serene" and that he hoped the investigations by the U.S. Senate would probe the matter to the bottom. 

Pasqua judged the situation detrimental to relationships between the United States and France.  For this reason, Pasqua declared that he had asked the president of the French Senate for the creation of an investigation commission, wishing that the French and U.S. senatorial commissions should collaborate.

Pasqua declared himself convinced that misconduct took place in the oil-for-food program, and that it was probable that some French people were involved.  He then wished that they should be sought and prosecuted. "If one wants to find the origin of the financial streams, one can do so."  Pasqua mentioned the Swiss company Genmar, which the U.S. report claims to have served as Pasqua's intermediary.

Pasqua denied information presented as facts in the report.  For instance, he denied having met [[:w:Tariq Aziz|Tariq Aziz]], former Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq.

Pasqua pointed out that nothing in the senatorial evidence indicates that he had benefited from vouchers, only that one of his former advisers, Bernard Guillet, had received oil allocations in his name. From December 2000 onwards, allocations meant for Pasqua ceased and were replaced by allocations to Bernard Guillet.  

Guillet was arrested by French authorities in April in connection with abuses under the oil-for-food program. Mr Guillet has been put under formal investigation for allegedly participating in a system of occult kickbacks and fees between 1996 and 2001 involving major French companies, including [[w:Total (company)|Total]]. He is suspected of having received amounts of money without good explanation from an intermediary specialized in the resale of Iraqi oil.

Former Pasqua aide claims Iraq intended to reward Charles Pasqua, denies having received oil
{{date|May 18, 2005}}

A former aide to French senator [[w:Charles Pasqua|Charles Pasqua]], whose name was cited by a recent report by a [[w:United States Senate|United States Senate]] investigation panel, has admitted that the Iraqi government had intended to reward Mr Pasqua with a grant of oil through the [[w:oil for food|oil for food]] program.

The aide, Bernard Guillet, was arrested in April 2005 and was put under formal criminal investigation on April 28 by French judge Philippe Courroye, under the charges of egregious influence peddling and of being an accessory to an abuse of corporate belongings. He is suspected of having received vouchers for buying Iraqi oil from the regime of [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]], which he then allegedly sold to oil companies, to an amount of 5 million barrels. 

Mr Pasqua, according to some sources, would have been the beneficiary of 10.8 million barrels. According to a [[w:CIA|CIA]] report, the profit would have been between 0.15[[w:Euro|€]] and 0.85€ per barrel.

American Samoa asks again to be removed from U.N. colonies list

{{date|May 29, 2005}}

[[American Samoa]]'s government delivered another message to United Nations representatives asking to be removed from the [[w:United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|U.N.'s list of world colonies]].  Commerce Department Deputy Director Lelei Peau was participating in a regional seminar held from May 17-19 in [[w:Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] by the U.N. Decolonization Committee.

The U.N. has promoted [[w:decolonization|decolonization]] since its founding, particularly since its Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was adopted in 1960.  In 1945, about one-third of the world's population lived in dependent, non-self governing Territories.  Today the U.N. lists 16 remaining colonies with fewer than 2 million total people.

American Samoa is asking to be removed from that list, on the grounds that it wishes to remain a freely associated territory of the United States.  Its position has remained unchanged since the Lieutenant Governor first asked to be removed from the list in 1993.

"The position of the people of American Samoa, and its duly elected legislative representatives and government officials is that the current status of the Territory and the United States government is the desired relationship we wish to have," said Governor [[w:Togiola Tulafono|Togiola T. A. Tulafono]] last year.  His message was delivered to the U.N. Decolonization Committee in their regional seminar held in the Pacific island country of [[w:Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]].

{{missing image|Image:Gov Togiola Tulafono speech.jpg|thumb|200px|left|American Samoan Governor Togiola T.A. Tulafono}}

"It has been a partnership that has aided both our peoples and the bonds of friendship between us are strong. We ask again that American Samoa be delisted as a 'colony' of the United States," said the governor's message.

The United States position, expressed to the U.N. General Assembly in 2003, is that its remaining territories are already in large measure self-governing.  These territories should be able to choose whether to be independent states as "equal and sovereign partners" of the United States, or remain integrated within the United States.

The legislature of American Samoa, called the Fono, has approved a Future Political Status Commission to study public opinion on possibly becoming a commonwealth or freely associated state.

Africa faces food crisis, UN Security Council told
{{date|July 1, 2005}}

The head of the {{w|World Food Programme}}, James Morris, has told the [[United Nations Security Council]] that Africa is facing a food crisis, with one in three people there malnourished.

[[Zimbabwe]] is one country that Morris is particularly concerned about at the moment. 

“It does not matter whether that instability is caused by civil conflict, drought, AIDS, poor governance or any combination of those factors-hunger almost always comes with it,” said Morris.

“The impact of rural-urban migration on employment in Africa has been precisely the opposite of Western Europe and the United States - it has led to higher rather than lower rates of unemployment and social instability. 

“At a certain point the capacities of local governments are stretched to the limit and social demands are not met, especially among competing ethnic groups perhaps not accustomed to sharing the same political space.”

In addition to Zimbabwe, 1.6 million in [[Malawi]], 1.2 million in [[Zambia]], 900,000 in [[Mozambique]], 245,000 in [[Lesotho]], 230,000 in [[Swaziland]], and 60,000 in [[Namibia]] all need emergency food aid.

According to Morris, the World Food Programme has been told by the Zimbabwe government that they will feed the people, which goes against the policies of the WFP. 

Morris highlighted the effects hunger can have - destabilizing countries and threatening peace and security. Food shortages are driving people into urban areas, where they are confronted by high unemployment and social instability.

U.N. to begin forming response to Iranian nuclear program
{{date|August 9, 2005}}
[[Image:IAEA flag.png|thumb|right|140px|International Atomic Energy Agency flag]]
A meeting set for Tuesday by the {{w|International Atomic Energy Agency}} (IAEA) could be a move closer to a showdown at the [[United Nations]] over the [[Iran]]ian plan to resume uranium conversion at its Isfahan nuclear facility.

Iran on Monday refused the weekend offer by the [[European Union]] (EU) of economic incentives that included help with nuclear-energy generation. The EU, led by Britain and France, both of which in May 2005 [http://www.un.org/events/npt2005/] were considered to have violated the ''first pillar'' of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by failing to make serious efforts to dismantle their nuclear bomb stockpiles (preamble and Article VI of the treaty), and Germany, combined the offer with an exchange for Iran to verifiably give up all activities that could lead to a nuclear bomb.

Iranian officials insist their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, and say it is part of Iran's right to develop nuclear power, as is legally agreed to in the ''third pillar'' of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which gives all states the right to peacefully use nuclear technology. "The proposals are unacceptable," Hossein Moussavian said.  "They negate Iran's inalienable right," said the top Iranian nuclear negotiator. 

The Iranian refusal, coming from under the new leadership of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], would probably trigger the referral of Iran to the [[UN Security Council]].

Iran began uranium conversion shortly after IAEA inspectors installed cameras and other surveillance equipment at their nuclear facility. The facility carried out an early stage of the fuel cycle, which includes turning raw uranium ({{w|yellowcake}}) into gas.  France and Britain condemned Iran's actions.

The IAEA sealed sensitive equipment at Iran's uranium conversion facility at Isfahan and its uranium enrichment plant at Natanz, as part of {{w|Tehran|Tehran's}} earlier compliance with a Paris agreement. An ''[[Al-Jazeera]]'' report said the IAEA seals on the plants' sensitive equipment was recently removed.

In a IAEA statement issued Monday, ''{{w|Reuters}}'' reports, "It should be noted that the sealed parts of the process line remain intact."

Oil for food scandal: UN releases third report
{{date|August  9, 2005}}

The [[w:UN|UN]]-appointed panel investigating the [[w:oil for food|oil for food]] scandal has released its third report. 

The report says that [[w:Benon Sevan|Benon Sevan]] took nearly US$150,000 in cash bribes. Chef de Cabinet for Kofi Annan, Mark Malloch Brown, said that the UN would lift Sevan's immunity should an approach come from a law enforcement authority and that the UN had been in 'active collaboration' with the Southern District of New York. 

At the press conference responding to the report, Malloch Brown also said that there was will "a real need for serious, deep-rooted management reform of our organization, and that does not seem to be yet fully accepted by all member states."

Benon Sevan, who worked for the UN for nearly 40 years before resigning on Sunday, has denied the accusation. In his resignation letter to Kofi Annan, he wrote: "The charges are false and you, who have known me all these years, should know they are false... I fully understand the pressure you are under..., but sacrificing me for political expediency will never appease our critics or help you or the organisation."

A former UN procurement officer [[w:Alexander Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]] has pleaded guilty to accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from UN contractors.

UN holding recruitment exams in under-represented countries
{{date|September 7, 2005}}

In order to find P-2 level officers for the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Secretariat|Secretariat}}, the international organization is holding competitive recruitment competitions in 42 countries. The examinations will take place in February, 2006.

Six occupational groups are being sought: [[Architecture]], Demography, Library, Security, Science and Technology, and Statistics. There will be a written examination (both a general paper and a specialised paper) and an interview.

The written examination questions are given in English and French, the two working languages of the Secretariat. Candidates must write their answers for the general paper in English or French. However, they may write their answers for the specialized paper in English, French, or any of the other four official languages of the Secretariat, i.e., Arabic, Chinese, Russian, or Spanish.

The examinations will take place on February 28, 2006 in [[New York City|New York]], [[Addis Ababa]], {{w|Andorra La Vella}}, [[Athens]], [[Bangkok]], [[Beirut]], [[Geneva]], [[Monaco]], [[Nairobi]], [[Santiago]], {{w|Vaduz}}, {{w|Valletta}}, and [[Vienna]].

According to the UN, applicants "should hold at least a first-level {{w|university degree}} relevant to the occupational group in which they would like to take the examination.  Furthermore, applicants should not be more than 32 years old on 31 December, 2006 ... Fluency in either English or French is required."

The following countries have been selected for the 2006 competition: [[Andorra]], [[Angola]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Barbados]], [[Botswana]], [[Brunei Darussalam]], [[Cabo Verde]], [[Comoros|Comores]], [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Gambia]], [[Japan]], [[Greece]], [[Grenada]], [[Guatemala]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Israel]], [[Kiribati]], [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Maldives]], [[Malta]], [[San Marino]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mexico]], [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]], [[Moldova]], [[Monaco]], [[Norway]], [[Oman]], [[Panama]], [[Portugal]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Samoa]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Switzerland]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Tonga]], [[Tuvalu]], [[USA]], and [[Vietnam]].

The practice of scouting under-represented nations for highly-qualified employees is an annual occurrence.

The United Nations Secretariat is one of the principal organs of the United Nations and it is headed by the United Nations Secretary General and assisted by a staff of international civil servants worldwide. It provides studies, information, and facilities needed by United Nations bodies for their meetings. It also carries out tasks as directed by the [[UN Security Council]], the [[UN General Assembly]], the UN Economic and Social Council, and other UN bodies. The United Nations Charter provides that the staff be chosen by application of the "highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity," with due regard for the importance of recruiting on a wide geographical basis.

UN inquiry finds mismanagement and failure of oversight

The Independent Inquiry Committee's report on the overall management and oversight of the UN's {{w|Oil-for-Food Programme}} has concluded that the [[United Nations]] requires stronger executive leadership, thorough administrative reform, and more reliable controls and auditing.

The Programme included more than $103 billion in transactions (over $64 billion in oil sales and almost $39 billion for food).  

Responsibility for what went wrong with the Programme is assigned to the {{w|UN Secretariat}}, members of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], its 661 Committee, and the Iraqi regime.  In a change from past practice, the Security Council had retained substantial elements of administrative control through its 661 Committee.  This caused neither the Secretariat leadership nor the Security Council to be in overall control.

There was reluctance of both the {{w|United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General}} and the Deputy Secretary-General to recognize their own responsibility for the Programme's shortcomings and they failed to ensure that critical evidence was brought to the attention of the Security Council and the 661 Committee.  They only made minimal efforts to address sanctions violations with Iraqi officials, and both failed to provide oversight of the Programme's Executive Director, Benon Sevan.

[[Image:TrialSaddam.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Saddam Hussein, leader of Iraqi regime.]]
As the Programme expanded and continued, [[Saddam Hussein]] found ways and means of turning it to his own advantage, primarily through demands for surcharges and kickbacks from companies doing business with the Programme.  For UN agencies, the work went beyond their core competencies of overseeing the distribution of humanitarian goods—from monitoring, planning, and consulting—to infrastructure rebuilding, thus multiplying problems.  Nor was there much success in coordinating so large a program among UN Agencies accustomed to zealously defending their institutional autonomy.

There were Iraqi attempts to pass money to former Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, principally through an Iraqi-American businessman, Samir Vincent, and a Korean lobbyist, Tongsun Park.  The Committee has determined that well over $1 million was paid to Mr. Vincent and Mr. Park. However, the Committee has not found evidence that Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali received or agreed to receive monies from Mr. Park and Mr. Vincent.

The report recommended better oversight and management, financial disclosure by more UN staff, and that UN agencies should return up to $50 million in excess compensation secured as a result of work performed under Security Council Resolution 1483.

The Committee's Chairman, Paul A Volcker, stated, "The inescapable conclusion from the Committee's work is that the United Nations Organization needs thoroughgoing reform—and it needs it urgently. What is important—what has been recognized by one investigation after another—is that real change must take place, and change over a wide area. Clear benchmarks for measuring progress must be set.  The General Assembly should insist, in its forthcoming meeting, that key reforms be put in place no later than the time of its regular meeting in 2006. To settle for less, to permit delay and dilution, would be to invite failure.  It would, in reality, further erode public support, undercut effectiveness, and dishonor the ideals upon which the United Nations is built."

He added, "Before concluding its work, the Committee also intends a more comprehensive listing of firms participating in the Programme, either in the purchase of oil or the sale of humanitarian goods, as well as a more detailed analysis of the manner in which Iraq and its vendors and oil purchasers unlawfully manipulated the Programme."

Report: Annan failed to fix Oil for Food program
{{date|September  9, 2005}}
[[Image:Kofi Annan.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Kofi Annan]]]]
After a year-long investigation, a committee has found that [[w:en:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]], head of the [[w:en:United Nations|United Nations]], failed to halt corruption in the [[w:en:Oil for Food|Oil for Food]] program, which was supposed to provide food to impoverished [[w:Iraq|Iraqi]] citizens. 

According to [[w:en:Paul Volcker|Paul Volcker]], head of the Independent Inquiry Committee,  "Our assignment has been to look for mis-or mal-administration in the oil-for-food program and for evidence of corruption within the UN organization and by contractors. Unhappily, we found both." 

The report emphasized that Annan knowingly allowed [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]] to continue making huge unethical profits off of the program.

While Annan acknowledged that there was blame to pass around, he stated that "None of us -- member states, Secretariat, agencies, funds and programs -- can be proud of what it has found." Annan also says that he was at least partly at fault for the corruption; "The report is critical of me personally, and I accept its criticism."

On a lighter note, while the report is critical of Annan, it also says that the Oil for Food program did help get food to many Iraqis.

Chavez wants UN uprooted from New York
[[Image:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|thumb|200px|right|United Nations headquarters, New York City.]]
{{date|September 16, 2005}}

In a speech before the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] President [[Hugo Chávez]] called for the {{w|UN headquarters}} to be moved out of the [[United States]].

Chávez cited the [[Iraq War]] and the US' alleged disregard for the will of the United Nations as his reasoning for proposing the pullout.  He then went on to criticize the proposed UN reforms, saying they were "illegal" as they did not take into account anti-poverty goals set out in a 2000 summit.  Proposing sweeping reforms, including the elimination of Security Council members' veto powers, Chávez described the UN as unfit for the 21st century.

[[Image:HugoChavez1824.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|President Chávez speaks in 2003.<br><small>Source: Victor Soares/ABr</small>]]
In a comment more related to the frosty relationship between the US and Venezuela, Chávez expressed regret that [[Pat Robertson]] remained at liberty.  Chávez has branded Robertson a terrorist for implying that the US would do well to assassinate the Venezuelan President.

The current summit marks the sixtieth anniversary of the formation of the United Nations, and many world leaders have gathered to work out reforms to the organization to make it more relevant in today's world.

UN agrees on reform document
{{date|September 17, 2005}}
[[Image:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|thumb|200px|right|United Nations headquarters, New York City.]]
A deal to reform the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] has been signed at the end of a summit marking the organisation's sixtieth anniversary.

The summit was the largest gathering of heads of state ever, with over 150 in attendance.  During its three days, [[w:Syria|Syria]] was the only one of the 191 represented nations not to address the [[w:General Assembly|General Assembly]].

The [[w:United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]], [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]], had put forward a wide-ranging set of reform proposals encompassing [[w:poverty|poverty]], [[w:war|war]], [[w:genocide|genocide]], and reform of the organisation itself.

Of the reforms that got through the intense diplomatic negotiations, Responsibility to Protect is one of the most significant. Rather than waiting for genocide to be demonstrated, the international community has now agreed to act in cases of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. A peacebuilding commission is also to be established by December 2005.

The opinions expressed by participants varied, with [[w:Venezuela|Venezuelan]] President, [[w:Hugo Chavez|Hugo Chavez]] condemning the document as having been "conceived in darkness".  In stark contrast, [[w:United States|United States]] ambassador, [[John R. Bolton]], praised the document.

World Food Program told to leave North Korea
{{date|September 23, 2005}}
{{Human rights infobox}}
[[North Korea]]n Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Su-hon has asked the [[United Nations]]  {{w|World Food Program}} (WFP) to stop providing food aid in the country.

Claiming a good harvest provided the country with sufficient food, and that the {{w|US}} was politicizing the aid issue, the formal request to end all humanitarian aid was made to {{w|United Nations Secretary General|UN Secretary General}} [[Kofi Annan]] at a meeting on September 21.

The WFP has been feeding approximately six million of the poorest and most needy in the reclusive communist state.  There is much concern its withdrawal will leave many without adequate aid.
{{Audio|World Food Program told to leave North Korea.ogg|2005-09-23}}
Neighbouring countries, including {{w|China}} and {{w|South Korea}}, will continue to supply food aid to the North Koreans; however, the donors do not manage this aid and international organisations are unable to determine that it is reaching those who need it.

The request for the WFP's withdrawal is suspected by some to be related to the ongoing talks about the nuclear program of North Korea; continued acceptance of aid is seen as a weakness that may influence their negotiating position.

IAEA and its director ElBaradei are awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
{{date|October  7, 2005}}
<!--[[Image:IAEA_flag.png|thumb|right|The Flag of the IAEA]]-->
[[Image:IAEA-Nobel2005-press-address.jpg|thumb|250px|right|IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei addressing the media]]
The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), a [[UN]] agency, and its Director [[Mohammed ElBaradei]] have been awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for [[2005]], the committee's chairman Professor Ole Danbolt Mjøs announced today.

In the announcement, the {{w|Norwegian Nobel Committee}} emphasizes the role the IAEA plays in preventing military use of nuclear energy arms proliferation, and ensuring peaceful use of nuclear energy. Furthermore, the Committee notes that IAEA's work is in line with {{w|Alfred Nobel}}'s original motivation for the Peace Prize, namely the reduction of standing armies. The committee expressed its belief that the increasing threat of nuclear arms today must be met through the broadest possible international cooperation, as exemplified in the work of the IAEA.

A spokeswoman for the IAEA, Melissa Flemming, said in {{w|Vienna}}: "I never thought we'd see this day. This is the proudest day for the IAEA. We are proud, astonished, elated."

The IAEA, headquartered in Vienna and established in 1957, seeks to prevent [[nuclear proliferation]] and promotes the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It is currently involved in efforts to bring DPRK (North Korea) back to the {{w|Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty}} (NPT) regime and verifying the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. These negotiations have been difficult, and are viewed by some [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1815682,00.html] as not very successful.

The 63-year old Mohamed ElBaradei, an Egyptian-born lawyer, heads the agency since 1997 and was recently confirmed for a third term.

US rejects EU proposal to give Internet control to the UN
{{date|October 3, 2005}}

The [[w:United States|United States]] announced it does not agree with the [[w:European Union|European Union]] officials' proposal to share more of the control of the [[w:Internet|Internet]] with the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]. U.S. Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs Ambassador [[w:David Gross|David Gross]] said, "We will not agree to the U.N. taking over the management of the Internet." Mr. Gross is coordinator for international communications and information policy at the U.S. Department of State and said further, "Some countries want that. We think that's unacceptable. No intergovernmental body should control the Internet, whether it's the U.N. or any other." 

E.U. spokesman Martin Selmay said, "We are looking for a new cooperation model; a model that allows Internet governance and the laying down of public policy principles in coordination by all countries which are interested in the governance of the Internet, because the Internet is a global resource."

The [[w:Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers|Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), a non-profit organization responsible for  the assignment of domain names and Internet Protocol addresses, currently controls the root zone files for the Internet. They are overseen by the U.S. Commerce Department, which granted them the original contract to oversee those tasks. 

Many nations have expressed displeasure at the U.S. having sole control of the Internet and suggest such control should be given to an intergovernmental body, such as the U.N. Other proposals include limiting ICANN to a technical role and establishing a new external organization to handle policy issues.   

The issue is scheduled to be discussed in November at the U.N. [[w:World Summit on the Information Society|World Summit on the Information Society]] in [[w:Tunis|Tunis]], Tunisia.

U.S. isolated in opposition to cultural diversity treaty
{{date|October 19, 2005}}

The [[w:United States|United States]] has become increasingly isolated this week in its stance against a new treaty designed to protect and promote cultural diversity in the age of transnational media industries. The treaty, called the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expressions, was sponsored by Canada and France and has been negotiated by government delegates from over 180 countries in a 2-year consensus process. It is expected to be approved later this week by the plenary session of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization [[w: UNESCO|UNESCO]]. 

The treaty grants individual countries a right "to maintain, adopt, and implement policies and measures they deem appropriate for the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions on their territory". This is designed to protect national cultural policy from 'free trade' agreements like the WTO/GATS, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, or bilateral trade negotiations. For example, the screenquota system in South Korea that requires Korean cinemas to show [[w:Korean cinema|Korean films]] about 50% of the time, which supporters argue has nurtured the growth of the Korean movie industry, would likely be eliminated if audiovisual services were brought into the WTO - as the United States Trade Representative has proposed. Other countries, like [[w:France|France]] and [[w:Canada|Canada]] have similar policies in place to support their local artists and film industry.

Promoters of the treaty argued that it will allow countries to promote and maintain cultural diversity. The British ambassador to UNESCO characterized the draft as "clear, carefully balanced, and consistent with principles of international law and fundamental human rights".

The United States government criticized the treaty on the grounds it would encourage trade protectionism and could serve as a justification for repressive governments to control their media systems. [[w:Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice]] wrote letters encouraging governments to oppose the treaty. 

The United States stood largely alone in that position. Last Monday night, the United States was only joined by [[w:Israel|Israel]] to vote for some last minute amendments brought in by the U.S., whereas 151 nations voted for the original wording of the treaty. [[w:Australia|Australia]] and [[w:Kiribati|Kiribati]] abstained.

U.N. denied access to Guantanamo inmates
{{date|November 1, 2005}}

Today, [[w:United States|U.S.]] [[w:U.S. Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[w:Donald Rumsfeld|Donald Rumsfeld]] renewed his denial to grant a [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] commission access to inmates at the [[w:Guantanamo Bay|Guantánamo Bay]] detention center. Last week the United States offered to let United Nations representatives visit the detention center, but they refused to let United Nations representatives visit the entire detention facility or interview detainees.

The United Nation's Special Rapporteur on torture, Manfred Nowak, told reporters on Monday that even China does not impose such conditions for United Nations visit of detention centers and that the United Nations could not accept an offer to visit the United States facility under conditions that are different from other nations. Nowak did show willingness to compromise on other controversial questions as the duration of the visit, which is limited to one day, and which individual United Nations representatives would be involved in the visit.

The United States has voiced objections to two of the proposed team of five United Nations inspectors: Leandro Despouy, Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and Paul Hunt, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Paul Hunt in particular has expressed strong suspicion of torture having occurred in Guantánamo. Those approved include Nowak from Austria in position as Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Asma Jahangir from Pakistan as Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and Leila Zerrougui from Algeria as Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention.

The United Nations has been requesting access to the naval base for four years.  The United States has explained that the restrictions placed on the UN visit are due to the nature of the ongoing [[w:War on Terrorism|War on Terrorism]].

A [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] health expert who is co-ordinating the response to the recent south-east Asian [[w:bird flu|bird flu]] outbreak, has warned that the disease could kill 'up to 150 million' people in the near future.

[[w:Dr David Nabarro|Dr David Nabarro]] told the [[w:BBC|BBC]] that a new outbreak of bird flu was possible, with migratory birds carrying the disease to Africa or the Middle East where the human death toll "could be anything between 5m and 150m".

"The consequences in terms of human life when the pandemic does start are going to be extraordinary and very damaging."

Bird flu &mdash; also known as avian influenza &mdash; is a type of influenza virulent in birds. It was first identified in [[w:Italy|Italy]] in the early [[w:1900s|1900s]] and is now known to exist worldwide. It was not known to affect humans until the first recorded case in [[w:Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] in [[w:1997|1997]].

Bird flu has spread rapidly through poultry and wild birds in Asia since [[w:2003|2003]], killing huge numbers of birds and more than 60 humans.

"It's like a combination of [[w:global warming|global warming]] and [[w:HIV|HIV/Aids]] 10 times faster than it's running at the moment," Dr Nabarro said.

In contrast to the shock-factor of Dr Nabarro's comments, the U.N. has distanced themselves from his remarks.  The [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]]'s official estimate for the death toll in the event of a mutation of the H5N1 virus is between 2 and 7.4 million.  WHO influenza spokesman, Dick Thompson, implied that Dr Nabarro would be taken to task over his remarks, stating, "I don't think you will hear Dr Nabarro say the same sort of thing again."

UN Report: Earth ecosystem in peril
{{date|March 31, 2005}}
A report Tuesday from a [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]-backed project, consulting more than 1,300 scientists from 95 countries, and written over the last four years, warns that 60 percent of the basics of life on Earth &mdash; water, food, timber, clean air &mdash; are currently being used in ways which degrade them. Furthermore, fisheries and fresh water use-patterns are unsustainable, and getting worse.

"The harmful consequences of this degradation could grow significantly worse in the next 50 years," according to a press release from the [[w:Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA)]], a massive four-year study begun in 2001.

"We've had many reports on environmental degradation, but for the first time we're now able to draw connections between ecosystem services and human well-being," Cristian Samper, director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington and a chief architect of the study, told the Christian Science Monitor.

The project's [http://www.maweb.org/proxy/document.aspx?source=database&TableName=Documents&IdField=DocumentID&Id=356&ContentField=Document&ContentTypeField=ContentType&TitleField=Title&FileName=MA+General+Synthesis+-+Final+Draft.pdf&Log=True ''Synthesis Report''], first in a series of eleven documents and published yesterday, explains the objective: ''"to assess the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and to establish the scientific basis for actions needed to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems and their contributions to human well-being."''

It then goes on to report on four main findings:

* ''Changes over the last 50 years to meet rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fiber and fuel, have effected substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.''

* ''Net gains in human well-being and economic development are offset by growing costs, in the form ecosystem degradation, the possibility of abrupt and unpredictable ecosystem changes, and worsened poverty for some groups. Unless addressed, these problems will substantially diminish the benefits that future generations obtain from ecosystems.''

* ''Ecosystem degradation could grow significantly worse over the next 50 years, presenting a barrier to meeting UN  Millennium Development Goals.''

* ''The challenge of reversing the degradation while meeting increasing ecological demands can be partially met under some scenarios, but only with significant changes in policies, institutions and practices  &mdash; changes that are not currently under way.''

Walter Reid, the study's director, speaking at yesterday's [[:w:London|London]] launch of the report said it shows that over the last 50 years "humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable time in human history."

"This has resulted in substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth," he said.

It is unclear what this will mean to future generations or the possible emergence of new diseases, absence of fresh water and the continuing decline of fisheries and completely unpredictable weather.

With half of the urban populations of [[:w:Africa|Africa]], [[:w:Asia|Asia]], [[:w:Latin America|Latin America]] and the [[:w:Caribbean|Caribbean]] suffering from several diseases associated with these problems, the death toll is reaching 1.7 million people a year. Entire species of mammals, birds and amphibians are disappearing from the planet at nearly 1,000 times the natural rate, according to the study. Oxygen-depleted coastal waters and rivers result from overuse of nitrogen [[:w:fertilizer|fertilizer]] - an effect known as "nutrient loading" which leads to continuing [[:w:biodiversity|biodiversity]] loss.

With the United States' non-participation in the [[w:Kyoto Treaty|Kyoto Treaty]], former U.S. Senator Timothy Wirth, president of this U.N. Foundation, says  "U.S. leadership is critical in providing much-needed expertise, technological capabilities and ingenuity to restore ecosystems.

"We can take steps at home to reduce our nation's adverse impact on the global environment."

"At the heart of this assessment is a stark warning," said the 45-member board.

UN accuses US of wholesale rights violations in Iraq
{{date|December  5, 2005}}
John Pace, [[w:human rights|human rights]] chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), condemned both the US-installed Iraqi government and the US Armed Forces for breach of human rights, centring largely around widespread [[w:habeas corpus|detention without authority or trial]].

"There is no question that terrorism has to be addressed. But we are equally sure that the remedies being applied... are not the best way of eliminating terrorism," Pace said during an interview on Sunday. <!-- with whom? -->

He quoted instances where Iraqi judges had ordered the release of groups of prisoners, and had found not only that their orders had been refused, but found themselves locked up as a reprisal.

On the subject of the [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]] trial resuming Monday, Pace told ''Reuters'', "Weakness in the system of administration of justice, in addition to the antecedents surrounding the establishment of this tribunal, will never be able to produce the kind of process that would be able to satisfy international standards." 

He also pointed out that the Iraqi authorities are the only legal entity allowed to detain prisoners, and that the US prison camps at [[w:Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] and similar locations are therefore technically illegal.

Bush threatens U.N. over Clinton climate speech
{{date|December 10, 2005}}

Officials in the [[w:George W. Bush|Bush]] administration privately threatened the organizers of the [[w:United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[w:Montreal|Montreal]], saying that any chance there might have been for the [[w:United States|United States]] to sign the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]] would be lost if [[Bill Clinton]] spoke Friday at the meeting.

The threat was received within minutes of the [[w:Associated Press|Associated Press]] running a story on Clinton being added to the program.  "It's just astounding." said one organizer. "It came through loud and clear from the Bush people—they wouldn't sign the deal if Clinton were allowed to speak."

Clinton said, "There's no way that I'm gonna let petty politics get in the way of the deal. So I'm not gonna come."  The organizers later reported that they had "called the administration's bluff."  Clinton delivered his speech as planned.

In his speech Friday, Clinton described the Bush administration's opposition to Kyoto as "flat wrong."

Vice-President [[Dick Cheney]] directed the U.S. envoy to walk out Thursday, in response to comments by [[Canada|Canadian]] Prime Minister [[w:Paul Martin|Paul Martin]] on Thursday.  The walk out is not believed to relate to Clinton's attendance.

UN warns neighbours of Turkey about bird flu
{{date|January 11, 2006}}
{{Avian Flu infobox}}
The [[United Nations]] Food and Agriculture Organization has asked countries neighbouring [[Turkey]], specifically mentioning [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], and [[Syria]], to be cautious and take measures to prevent the [[avian flu]], H5N1, from spreading. The UN also warned that civilians in these countries should be given more information about the disease. 

Two people have died in Turkey so far, possibly a third, and more hospitalized, after contracting the flu virus. All 15 confirmed cases in Turkey had close contact with birds. As of now, the H5N1 virus strain does not pass easily to humans and does not spread at all between humans.

Two-day bird flu conference draws $1.9 billion in pledges
{{Avian Flu infobox}}
{{date|January 19, 2006}}
In Beijing, China, 1.9 billion US dollars in pledges came from 33 countries and a host of multilateral institutions at the end of a meet co-ordinated by the [[w:World Bank|World Bank]]. The amount exceeded the organization's estimate of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in funds required to contain the [[w:avian flu|avian flu]] over the next three years. In addition to aiding research efforts, the money is expected to help strengthen surveillance and increase the stockpiling of surgical masks and other equipment. 

The United States was the largest donor, pledging $334 million in grants. Japan pledged $159 million while the European Union pledged $120 million. The EU member nations promised an additional $138 million.

China which is home to a third of the entire world's population of birds pledged $10 million to help other countries with the effort.  Jia Youling, China's chief veterinary official defended the relatively small pledge claiming that China was still a developing country and faced a serious challenge from bird flu within its borders. Premier [[w:Wen Jiabao|Wen Jiabao]] personally attended the conference and announced that the country would share more information on outbreaks in the country, including samples that will assist in tracing genetic changes.

Dr. Lee Jong-wook, the director general of the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]], believes that the Chinese government was fully committed to sharing information openly and freely about bird flu cases. But he cautions that it would be difficult to stay fully informed about every health development in a country as populous as China.

Dr. Lee also expressed his concern about reports that children in Turkey have now become infected with the A([[w:H5N1|H5N1]]) avian influenza virus without becoming ill. Some studies suggest that the disease must become less lethal before it can cause a global epidemic, he noted. There is concern that patients may continue to infect more people by going through their daily routines if the flu symptoms remain mild.

Some scientists note that the avian flu has been known to occur among poultry in southern China since at least 1996. They are encouraged that the avian flu virus has failed to evolved into a form that is transmittable by people in all this time. This could be an indication that this would never happen. But others including officials from the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] [[w:Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization]] disagree claiming that increased contact between infected poultry and people raises the odds that the virus may eventually adapt better for transmission among humans.

Iran reported to U.N. Security Council
{{date|February  4, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag of IAEA.svg|190px|thumb|Symbol of the IAEA.]]
[[Image:Flag_of_Iran.svg|200px|thumb|National flag of Iran.]]
The [[IAEA]] board has passed a resolution to report [[Iran]] to the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The decision by the 35-nation board came on Saturday. 

The resolution was made without waiting for the director of the IAEA, [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], to finish preparing a report on {{w|Iran's nuclear program|Iran's civilian}} (and {{w|Iran and weapons of mass destruction|allegedly military}}) nuclear programs for the regular IAEA meeting scheduled for March 6. According to [[al-Jazeera|''al-Jazeera'']], ElBaradei refused to accept pressure from Western states to finish his report in advance of the March 6 meeting. ElBaradei said in written responses to requests by the [[United States|US]] and [[European Union|EU]] member states that he had given Iran until the meeting in March to answer questions to IAEA enquiries, stating, ''Due process, therefore, must take its course before <nowiki>[we are]</nowiki> able to submit a detailed report''. ElBaradei also said that another IAEA verification mission was due in Iran shortly and that he had only in mid-January sent extra questions to Iran based on what diplomats called newly released intelligence.

The text of the resolution, made without the results of the report, which will only be ready in March, requires ElBaradei to report to the Security Council "steps Iran needs to take to dispel suspicions about its nuclear ambitions."

The resolution states that there are serious concerns about Iran's nuclear program. It also notes, "Iran's many failures and breaches of its obligations," (to the non-proliferation treaty) and expresses "the absence of confidence that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes." 

The resolution also states that Iran is to:

* Re-establish a freeze on uranium enrichment and related activities;

* Consider whether to stop construction of a heavy water reactor that could be the source of plutonium for weapons;

* Formally ratify an agreement allowing the IAEA greater inspecting authority and continue honoring the agreement before it is ratified; and

* Give the IAEA additional power in its investigation of Iran’s nuclear program, including "access to individuals" for interviews, as well as to documentation on its black-market nuclear purchases, equipment that could be used for nuclear and non-nuclear purposes and "certain military-owned workshops" where nuclear activities could take place

The resolution calling for the referral was apparently drafted by several members states of the European Union together with the United States. Political analyst Joshua Frank claims that the US is not interested in diplomatic means of limiting Iran's possible shift towards nuclear weapons development and that the major reasons are Iran's oil supplies and plans to open an International Oil Bourse in {{w|petroeuro|petroeuros}}, which would challenge the {{w|petrodollar}}, on March 20, 2006.

The agency vote sets the stage for future action by the top U.N. body. [[Russia]] and [[China]] insisted, in casting their votes with the majority, that future votes on deliberations should wait until at least March. The outcome could include economic and political sanctions. This process of successive escalation of the tension between Iran and the Western members of the Security Council was described by {{w|Hans Blix}}, responsible for about 700 inspections for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as ''{{w|spin (public relations)|spin}} and momentum''. He was in favour of ''inducing Iran to forego enrichment'' but also recommended that the United States give a similar commitment not to attack Iran with either conventional or nuclear weapons, just as it apparently has to [[North Korea]].

27 of the 35 nations on the board voted for the referral.

Three nations that voted against the resolution: [[Cuba]], [[Syria]] and [[Venezuela]]. Five other countries [[Algeria]], [[Belarus]], [[Indonesia]], [[Libya]] and [[South Africa]], abstained. 
{{wikipediapars|weapons of mass destruction in [[w:Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|UK]], [[w:Iran and weapons of mass destruction|Iran]], [[w:Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Israel]], and [[w:Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq]]}}
Jack Straw, Foreign Secretary of the [[United Kingdom]], a {{w|nuclear weapons}} state obliged under Article VI of the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty}} to destroy its own, existing nuclear weapons, said that the IAEA vote showed "the international community's determination to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East."

===Iranian reactions===
After the decision, Iran said today that it would "immediately" begin the steps to "restart full-scale uranium enrichment" and "curtail" the powers of the IAEA inspectors.

Javad Vaeedi, deputy Iranian nuclear negotiator, said in a press conference after the vote, "After this decision, Iran has to immediately bring into force its parliamentary law to suspend voluntary implementation of (the watchdog agency's) Additional Protocol (on snap inspections) and (pursue) commercial-scale enrichment which until today was under full suspension." He also said, "this resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on legal or technical grounds."

Iran has also said that a proposed deal by [[Moscow]] to enrich Iranian uranium is dead. 

"There is no adequate reason to pursue the Russian plan," said Vaeedi. "Commercial scale uranium enrichment will be resumed in Natanz in accordance with the law passed by the parliament."

Iran had said that it will "end cooperation with IAEA", if referred to the Security Council. 

As of January 31, 2006, the Deputy Director General for Safeguards of the IAEA had reported that ''Iran has continued to facilitate access under its Safeguards Agreement as requested by the Agency, and to act as if the Additional Protocol is in force, including by providing in a timely manner the requisite declarations and access to locations.''

In a 40-page report released today, the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] special envoys on [[w:torture|torture]] reported their findings regarding the [[United States]] detention facility at [[w:Guantanamo Bay|Guantanamo Bay]] on the island of [[Cuba]]. The report concludes that certain procedures practised at the facility, and during transport to it, constitute torture. Moreover the report states that "attempts by the United States Administration to redefine 'torture' in the framework of the struggle against terrorism, in order to allow certain interrogation techniques that would not be permitted under the internationally accepted definition of torture, are of utmost concern." The report goes on to state that "the interrogation techniques authorized by the [[w:Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], particularly if used simultaneously, amount to degrading treatment in violation of article 7 of [[w:ICCPR|ICCPR]] and article 16 of the [[w:United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]]."

The report recommends that the United States bring the detainees to trial "in accordance with criminal procedure" or "release them without further delay", and that "The United States Government should close the Guantánamo Bay detention facilities without further delay." To avoid further practices amounting to "torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, discrimination on the basis of religion, and violations of the rights to health and freedom of religion" the report recommends that "In particular, all special interrogation techniques authorized by the Department of Defense should immediately be revoked."

In response to the report, White House spokesperson Scott McClellan said that the facility housed "dangerous terrorists". US officials have dismissed most of the claims as "largely without merit" and pointed out that the authors of the report never visited Guantanamo Bay, despite an invitation issued to three of the five investigators in November.

In an interview with the German weekly newspaper [[w:Die Zeit|''Die Zeit'']] the United Nation's Special Rapporteur on torture and coauthor of the report Manfred Nowak said that it was the "sole responsibility of the United States that we could not visit Guantanamo". He adds that the United States explicitly barred the UN inspectors from talking to detainees, without which proper investigations are impossible. He pointed out that the need for interviews with prisoners, in order for considering investigations to be comprehensive, "is also the position of the United States when it concerns other countries, like [[China]]".

Sports footwear companies progress towards eliminating sweatshops
{{date|February 6, 2005}}
A [[United Nations]] report has shown that sports footwear companies are making progress towards ending the use of sweatshops and are implementing more worker-friendly codes of practice than clothing companies and retailers.

The study, published by the [[International Labour Organisation]], suggests that consumer pressure is behind the changes. As a result of consumer's concerns, footwear companies have been diverting financial and human resources towards developing and implementing better codes of conduct for suppliers. Large teams have been established within companies to work toward the goal of better conditions for factory workers.

The study, based upon interviews with hundreds of managers, activists, government officials, factory workers and worker representatives and visits to companies all over the world, goes on to suggest that workers should be given more powers to oversee conditions in their places of work.

Clothing companies have been failing to make such good progress due the large number of constantly-changing suppliers they use, with the ILO study describing progress as "spotty." A major retailer may have a supply base of over 5,000 different companies, making it more difficult to establish stronger, more effective links with supply companies. They have also assigned less manpower to the task of compliance with codes of practice.

In some areas of the retail industry, there has been almost no compliance with codes of practice.

China and Russia object to the Security Council statement on Iran
{{date|March 15, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|United Nations Flag]]
[[Image:Flag of IAEA.svg|thumb|IAEA Flag]]
A draft [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] statement backed by the [[United States]], [[UK|Britain]], and [[France]] calling for a report in two weeks on Iran's compliance with demands that it suspend {{w|Enriched uranium|uranium enrichment}} was objected to by [[China]] and [[Russia]] on Tuesday. Russia and China prefer a six-week deadline and want the report to go to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], rather than to the Security Council. 

While the Security Council members agree that Iran should not be making nuclear weapons, they disagree on the course of action to take. Iran says that its nuclear program is for producing energy, but the IAEA has expressed a "lack of confidence" over Iran's intentions. Some nations in the west, including the U.S., claim that Iran's goal of nuclear energy production is a cover for nuclear bomb development.

The draft Security Council proposals cite "the conviction that continued Iranian enrichment-related activity would intensify international concern." They reiterate that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction "constitutes a threat to international peace and security." Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]], Iran's supreme leader, said the nuclear program is "irreversible," and any retreat would endanger the Islamic republic's independence. Russia and China, on the other hand, are not as skeptical of Iran. They state that tough council action could cause Iran to withdraw from the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty}} and to ban inspectors sent from the International Atomic Energy Agency. 

Following last month's IAEA board report to the Security Council, expressing lack of confidence, Iran ended its voluntary cooperation with the IAEA under the Additional Protocol and said it would start uranium enrichment and bar surprise inspections of the facilities.

United Nations General Assembly votes to establish UN Human Rights Council
{{date|March 16, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag_of_the_United_Nations.svg|thumb|right|United Nations Flag]]
Yesterday, the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly}} voted overwhelmingly to establish a United Nations {{w|United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council}} "to promote and protect fundamental rights, and deal with major human rights offenders," according to a press release.

170 countries voted for the proposed resolution and four voted against ({{w|Israel}}, the {{w|Marshall Islands}}, {{w|Palau}}, and the {{w|United States}}), with three abstentions ({{w|Belarus}}, {{w|Iran}}, and {{w|Venezuela}}). The Council will replace the {{w|Commission on Human Rights}}, which has lost credibility in past years due to politicization.

The United States objected that the resolution did not go far enough to exclude from membership in the new Council those nations which it alleges are the worst human rights abusers. 

Rodrigo Malmierca Díaz, the Cuban Ambassador, declared that a "huge discredit" had befallen the previous Commission due to the "political manipulation, hypocrisy and double standards imposed on its work by the United States and the European Union." 

The 191-member General Assembly approved the resolution, which stated "members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, fully cooperate with the Council, and be reviewed under the universal periodic review mechanism, during their term of membership."

The resolution calls for elections for the new body on May 9, 2006 and an inaugural meeting on June 19, while the Commission will be abolished on June 16.

The Council will consist of 47 members, each elected individually by a majority (96 members or more) of the General Assembly. If the Council members fail to uphold high standards of human rights, they can be suspended from the Council by a two-thirds majority of  Assembly members present at the meeting.

UN creates rapid-response fund for disasters
{{date|March 21, 2006}}

After every earthquake, flood, or other disaster, the call goes out for pledges to fund emergency relief. Then a second round of begging tries to convert those pledges into actual payments. In the meantime, some relief is delayed, and people die. Money that does eventually come may not be in proportion to the need. For example, relief funding for the 26 December 2004 [[w:tsunami|tsunami]] generally came rapidly and exceeded the amount requested, but famine relief for 3.5 million Kenyans suffering drought is now [http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17786&Cr=Kenya&Cr1= 75% underfunded]. 

To help solve these problems, the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] this month created the Central Emergency Response Fund ([[w:CERF|CERF]]) as a rainy-day savings account, to be dipped into when urgent needs require that money be spent within days--not in several months after aid pledges start being fulfilled. The Fund is about half way to the goal of half a billion dollars in deposits, which could be spent for either natural or man-made disasters.
 
"We meet to launch a fund that is proactive rather than reactive. The CERF will provide a ready pool of resources that better empower the United Nations in funding immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of disasters," said UN Secretary-General [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] on March 9.

[[w:Jan Egeland|Jan Egeland]], the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, will manage the Fund. "We are working on the two first allocations from the CERF...One is to the Horn of Africa and Kenya drought, the other one is to Cote d'Ivoire where humanitarian work and the civilian population is suffering so much," he said. "Too often, aid resembles a lottery in which a few win but most lose based on considerations other than need. We must move from lottery to predictability so all those who suffer receive aid."

The biggest donations paid so far are $41 million from Sweden and $30 million from Norway. The largest pledges are $70 million from the United Kingdom and $24 million from the Netherlands.

UN inaugurates rapid-response fund for future disasters
{{date|March 21, 2006}}

After every earthquake, flood, or other disaster, the call goes out for pledges to fund emergency relief. Then a second round of begging tries to convert those pledges into actual payments.

Sex-for-aid spreads in war-torn Liberia
{{date| May 8, 2006}}

[[Image:Liberia-Pos.png|right|thumb|150px|Location of Liberia]]
The aid agency [[w:Save the Children|Save the Children]] says an alarming number of girls in [[w:Liberia|Liberia]], as young as eight, were having sex with [[w:UN peacekeepers|UN peacekeepers]], policemen, teachers and humanitarian aid workers in exchange for money, food or favours.

"People don't really accept it but because of the financial constraints, people just have to do so. Most of them are in households headed by only the mother, catering for children. Their fathers got killed in the war, or some fathers are living but can't afford to care for their children; they have to accept the situation, so there is no way out. " 

The report says most people cited lack of economic and livelihood opportunities, as well as chronic poverty, as underlying causes for the ongoing exploitation of children. Parents reported feeling powerless to stop children who were having sex in exchange for goods and services, as they did not have the economic means to provide for their children. In some instances, families cited that transactional sex was a means of supporting the wider family to access things such as food or money to purchase food. In other cases, children identified more personal needs such as clothing or being able to access video clubs to watch films. The widespread nature of the problem meant it affected children in a broad cross section of environments. 

The study, conducted by [[w:Save the Children|Save the Children]], was intended to explore the ways in which children in 'Internally Displaced Person' (IDP) camps are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse as they attempt to meet their basic and other needs. It also explored the roles and responsibilities of humanitarian agencies in providing more protective systems for the delivery of assistance. During the discussions in the field, 315 men, women and children were consulted.

The people of Liberia have experienced ongoing suffering over the past two decades as a result of war and displacement. Children have been drawn into this in many ways, such as recruitment into armed forces, separation from their families, witnessing atrocities, rape and torture. Thousands have been driven from their homes into exile in neighbouring countries or camps for IDPs within Liberia, the report says.

Liberia has been shattered by the 1989-2003 civil war which caused an estimated 250,000 deaths in a country of barely 3 million people. The war forced around 1.3 million people from their homes into camps around the capital [[w:Monrovia|Monrovia]] or abroad.

Elections late last year saw Harvard-trained former World Bank economist [[w:Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf|Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf]] elected as the new president. Her government faces a massive task in rebuilding an economy and society torn apart by years of bloodshed. Many Liberians have been, and continue to be, heavily reliant on humanitarian assistance as a means of survival. Those who are able to find work often still live in chronic poverty with the national average wage being only US$50 per month.

The report found that people unanimously agree that attitudes have fundamentally changed since the war.

“It is like the cultural tradition is not holding any more. People have lost the cultural values and the tradition has been broken down. ” 

Most people said that children were not involved in prostitution before the war, or to a very small extent, and that this only happened in the cities but not in the villages.

Bush announces food aid to Darfur, AU faces fund crisis
{{date|May 9, 2006}}

President [[w:George W Bush|George W Bush]] has announced US emergency food shipments to [[w:Darfur|Darfur]], a province of [[w:Sudan|Sudan]]. He has asked Congress to approve $225m in aid. Sudan and the biggest rebel group signed a peace deal last Friday to end the  three year old civil war, claiming more than 200,000 lives. 

[[w:Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice]], US secretary of state will address the UN Security Council to help speed up the deployment of UN peacekeepers to the  Darfur region. 

"She's going to request a resolution that will accelerate the deployment of UN peacekeepers into Darfur," President Bush said. "We're now working with the [[w:UN|UN]] to identify countries that contribute those troops, so the peacekeeping effort will be robust." 

The Government of Sudan had previously denied UN deployment. But, after the signing of the peace treaty, they have expressed their keenness on the deployment of UN peacekeepers.

== AU lacks fund ==

So far, there are around 7,000 [[w:African Union|African Union]] peacekeepers in Darfur, but they have failed to play any significant role to control the violence in the region. They are facing a serious shortage of funds and man-power. It had been two months since any soldier in the peacekeeping forces were paid, [[w:Nigeria|Nigeria]]n envoy to the African Union confirmed yesterday.

Ambassador Sam Ibok, Nigerian envoy to the AU said, "There have been some cash flow problems, but that has been resolved now and troops will be paid in the next week or so. "

== Chad welcomes treaty ==

[[w:Chad|Chad]], Sudan's neighbouring state, welcomed the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement between the Sudanese government and the main faction of the rebel [[w:Sudan Liberation Movement|Sudan Liberation Movement]]. Chad broke off diplomatic relations with Sudan on 14 April, a day after an attack on [[w:N’Djamena|N’Djamena]] by rebel forces from Sudan. Also, Chad withdrew its delegation from African Union-brokered peace talks for Sudan’s troubled western Darfur region citing Sudanese aggression. Currently, there are more than 200,000 Darfur refugees. 

Foreign minister Ahmat Allami said, "Chad welcomes the signing of the Abuja peace deal on Darfur between the warring Sudanese parties after a long period of negotiations."

[[w:Libya|Libya]] announced today that it would resume effort to normalize bilateral relations between Chad and Sudan. A Libyan official said a tripartite summit would be held soon.

China enters UN human rights council
{{date|May 9, 2006}}

The [[UN]] [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] elected the [[UN]] {{w|UN Human Rights council|Human Rights council}} by secret ballot on May 9, 2006. With the participation of 191 member countries and all votes valid, the assembly elected 44 of the 47-strong membership of the new council, practically putting an end to months of thorny debates. Three seats from Eastern Europe will be elected on Wednesday. Sixty-seven states stood for election.

India emerged as the top vote-getter in Tuesday's elections, winning 173 out of 191 votes in a secret ballot to elect the 47-member Council. It was the biggest tally for any country, surpassing Japan (158) and China (146) in Asia.

{{w|India}}, {{w|Indonesia}}, {{w|Bangladesh}}, {{w|Japan}}, {{w|Malaysia}}, {{w|Pakistan}}, {{w|South Korea}}, {{w|China}}, {{w|Jordan}}, {{w|Philippines}}, {{w|Bahrain}}, {{w|Saudi Arabia}}, and {{w|Sri Lanka}} are included in the Asian Group.

{{w|Argentina}}, {{w|Brazil}}, {{w|Cuba}}, {{w|Ecuador}}, {{w|Guatemala}}, {{w|Mexico}}, {{w|Peru}}, and {{w|Uruguay}} were elected for Latin America and the Caribbean Group. 

{{w|Ghana}}, {{w|Zambia}}, {{w|Senegal}}, {{w|South Africa}}, {{w|Mali}}, {{w|Mauritius|Maurice Islands}}, {{w|Morocco}}, {{w|Gabon}}, {{w|Djibouti}}, {{w|Cameroon}}, {{w|Tunisia}}, {{w|Nigeria}}, and {{w|Algeria}} comprise the African Group.

The Western European and Other Groups include {{w|Germany}}, {{w|France}}, {{w|UK|Great Britain}}, {{w|Switzerland}}, {{w|Netherlands}}, {{w|Finland}}, and {{w|Canada}}.

All groups were completed but that of Eastern Europe, which only selected three of six seats: {{w|Russia}}, {{w|Poland}}, and {{w|Czech Republic}}. Another voting round will be held to elect the remaining three seats 

The {{w|United States}} initially opposed this Council and declined to run for a seat citing inadequate correctives. A US State Department spokesperson criticizes the records of  new Council members Cuba, China, Russian and Saudi Arabia, hinting that they do not merit being on the Council. US Ambassador [[John R. Bolton]] has said the US would work with other member states "to make the council as strong and effective as it can be."

The creation of the Human Rights Council is seen as a key component of overall reform of the United Nations. The new Human Rights Council replaces the 60-year old, largely discredited Human Rights Commission. The Commission was disbanded after a number of countries with dubious human right records manipulated elections to win seats and began to work together as a bloc to defeat resolutions critical against any one of them. 

The new Council will be required to conduct a regular review of the human rights record of all countries beginning with those serving on it. The Council will have its first sitting in Geneva on June 19.

Cholera outbreak hits Angola
{{date|May 18, 2006}}
[[Image:LocationAngola.png|thumb|right|Angola, Africa]]
A [[w:cholera|cholera]] epidemic in [[w:Angola|Angola]] has killed over 1,200 people in the past three months. The UN [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO) says about 35,000 people have fallen ill, half the victims in the capital of Luanda, where the first cases were detected in February. 

The UN say the epidemic is Angola’s worst cholera outbreak in almost two decades continues to rage on with 546 new cases and 31 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. A third of the victims are children under 5.

The medical charity Mangola, Medecines Sans Frontieres and the World Health Organisation say it is the worst outbreak recorded in the country. Spokesman for Medecines Sans Frontiere Richard Veerman said: "Angola is heading for its worst ever outbreak and the situation remains very bad in Angola," he said. 

"It's very worrying, the official number of deaths countrywide is now more than 1,200, which is likely under-reported. Many people will be at home and die at home and have no possibility to come to one of our treatment centres."

Cholera, an acute intestinal disease caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, causes copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment, including rehydration, is not given promptly.

UN: Guantanamo Bay should be closed
{{date|May 19, 2006}}

[[File:Camp x-ray detainees.jpg|thumb|File image of detainees upon arrival at [[w:Camp X-Ray|Camp X-Ray]], January 2002]]

The [[United Nations]] Committee against Torture told the [[United States]] today that the US should close its detention facility at [[w:Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]] as well as disclose the existence of any secret prisons it operates. 

The committee, made up of 10 independent experts has urged the [[w:Bush administration|Bush administration]] to put a stop to the use of torture or cruel treatment during the interrogation of terror suspects.

In an 11-page report, the committee said that the US should not detain anyone in a secret facility under its control. The committee also said that the US should disclose and investigate any such facilities. It is alleged that the US has a number of secret prisons where suspects are transported to and questioned using techniques that violate international human rights conventions.

Earlier this month, the US sent 30 officials to a torture committee hearing in [[Geneva]]. The delegation was criticized for failing to comment on questions relating to America's alleged secret prisons.

The committee ruled that there was evidence that US military personnel in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] had violated the rights of some detainees. The committee said that some of the US' techniques had resulted in the deaths of prisoners during the interrogation process. The committee further claimed that "vague" guidelines had led to abuse of detainees.

According to the ''Associated Press'', John B. Bellinger III, a State Department legal advisor and participant during the hearings at Geneva, said of the recommendation to close the base that, "one, seems to be beyond their mandate; two, legally wrong to say that the existence of Guantanamo is a per se violation of the convention; and, three, a not very practical recommendation given that they say that it ought to be closed but that individuals can't be sent back to a large number of countries."

President Bush said previously on ARD German television that he wants to close the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp. According to White House spokesman Tony Snow, the President is waiting for the US Supreme Court to decide on the issue of whether military tribunals or civilian courts would try the detainees.

Riot at Guantanamo Bay detention camp
{{date|May 20, 2006}}
[[Image:Guantanamo030228-N-4936C-096.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A detainee is escorted to a medium security facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]]
Inmates at [[w:Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp|Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in [[Cuba]] have attacked guards with fan blades and other makeshift weapons. Rear Admiral Harry Harris, the commander of [[w:Joint_Task_Force_Guantanamo|Joint Task Force Guantanamo]] says some detainees were injured in "the most violent outbreak" at the facility since it was opened in 2002.

Officers fired rubber bullets at the detainees after the guards were attacked with "broken light fixtures, fan blades" and other improvised weapons. Rear Admiral Harris says, "minimum force was used to quell the disturbance".

The [[w:New York Times|New York Times]] reports that a riot-control unit with batons and shields quelled Thursday’s disturbance. Another episode involved two other groups of inmates who tore apart their quarters and attacked guards.

Military officials said the detainees' actions were designed to draw attention to the plight of the terror suspects detained indefinitely in "Gitmo". Rear Admiral Harris, said that a prisoner was pretending to hang himself to lure the guards into the room. "The detainees had slickened the floor of their block with faeces, urine and soapy water in an attempt to trick the guards," he said. "They then assaulted the guards with broken light fixtures, fan blades and bits of metal."

The guards used pepper spray and blasted the detainees with several shots from a shotgun, firing rubber balls during the five-minute fight. No guards were hurt, but six inmates were treated for "minor injuries," he said.

Colonel Mike Bumgarner said guards shot five rounds of [[w:Rubber_bullet|"nonlethal"]] pellets from a 12-gauge shotgun, and a rubber grenade from an M-203 launcher. He said rioting then broke out in two other blocks of Camp Four when around 50 detainees damaged their quarters and made weapons to attack the guards. Colonel Bumgarner said it took an hour to bring the disturbances under control. He says the six detainees received minor injuries.

A military spokesman said 60 of the detainees were later transferred to more secure areas of the camp. Colonel Bumgarner says "detainees were jumping out of the beds on top of the guards" and some guards were knocked to the floor. "Frankly we were losing the fight at that point," he said.  "This illustrates to me the dangerous nature of the men we have detained here," Rear Admiral Harris told reporters in a teleconference.
[[Image:M203_1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|M203 grenade launcher]]
Earlier in the day, two other detainees attempted suicide by overdosing on hoarded prescription drugs. Guantanamo officials said there have been 41 suicide attempts by 25 detainees and no deaths since the camp opened in January 2002. Defense lawyers contend the figure is higher.

Meanwhile, the [[w:United Nations Committee Against Torture|United Nations Committee Against Torture]] has called on the [[United States]] to shut down Guantanamo and close any other "secret prisons" it operates. The UN declared the indefinite detention of suspects without charge a "violation of the UN Convention Against Torture."

"The State party should cease to detain any person at Guantanamo Bay and close this detention facility, permit access by the detainees to judicial process or release them as soon as possible," the committee said. They called on the US to "ensure that no one is detained in any secret detention facility under its de facto effective control".

Chief of World Health Organization dies
{{date|May 22, 2006}}
[[Image:Jwleeofficial.jpg|right|200px]]
The head of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), [[w:Lee Jong-wook|Doctor Lee Jong-wook]], 61, has died after doctors performed brain surgery on him to relieve a blood clot.

"I am sorry to tell you that Dr Lee Jong-wook, director-general of the WHO, died this morning. [This is a] very sad bit of news" and Lee "was an exceptional person and an exceptional director-general. Under his leadership, the WHO has been strengthened and has been able to give an effective response to world (health) problems," said Elena Salgado, [[Spain]]'s Health Minister in a statement during the organization's 192-nation annual assembly held in [[Geneva]]. The panel observed two minutes of silence to honor Lee.

Lee was rushed to Cantonal Hospital in Geneva when he felt sick on Saturday. He became sick while he was at an official meeting. Doctors then determined that he had a blood clot in his brain and operated on Lee immediately.

"He had been in hospital since Saturday afternoon, where he underwent surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain (a subdural hematoma). He remained in intensive care. At 07:43 this morning, he was declared dead," said a statement by the WHO on its website.

"All of the staff of the World Health Organization extend their most sincere condolences to Dr Lee's family. The sudden loss of our leader, colleague and friend, is devastating," continued the statement.

"The world has lost a great man today. LEE Jong-wook was a man of conviction and passion. He was a strong voice for the right of every man, woman and child to health prevention and care, and advocated on behalf of the very poorest people," said [[Kofi Annan]], the United Nations Secretary General.

Lee became head of the WHO in 2003 and leaves behind his son, wife and two brothers.

United Nations Report: Deserts threatened by global warming
{{date|June 5, 2006}}
[[Image:Libyan Dessert.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Libyan Desert: The world's deserts are under threat, says UNEP.]]
A new report, titled "Global Deserts Outlook," has been released on [[w:World Environment Day|World Environment Day]] by the [[w:United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)]]. The report suggests that the world's deserts face dramatic changes as a result of global [[w:Climate change|climate change]]: high water demands, tourism and salt contamination of irrigated soils. Desert margins and mountainous areas within deserts that have been important for people, wildlife and water supplies for millennia, are under particular threat, say UNEP.

2006 is the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]' International Year of [[w:Desert|Deserts]] and [[w:Desertification|Desertification]]. Yet deserts could become the "carbon-free power houses of the 21st century," some experts believe. They argue an area 800 by 800 km of desert, such as the [[w:Sahara|Sahara]], could capture the solar energy to generate all the world's electricity needs - and more. 

The report, prepared by experts from across the globe, flags options that may help governments and relevant bodies deliver a more sustainable future for the Earth's desert regions.

"There are many popular and sometimes misplaced views of deserts which this report either confirms or overturns. Far from being barren wastelands, they emerge as biologically, economically and culturally dynamic while being increasingly subject to the impacts and pressures of the modern world," said Shafqat Kakakhel, UNEP's Officer in Charge and Deputy Executive Director. 

"If the huge, solar-power potential of deserts can be economically harnessed the world has a future free from fossil fuels. And tourism based around desert nature can, if sensitively managed, deliver new prospects and perspectives for people in some of the poorest parts of the world," said Mr Kakakhel.

Almost one-quarter of the earth's land surface – some 33.7 million square kilometres – has been defined as "desert" in some sense. These deserts are inhabited by over 500 million people, significantly more than previously thought. In many parts of the world desert cores remain pristine, representing some of the planet's "last remaining areas of total wilderness," stated the UNEP in a news release.

Desert species are on the brink of extinction the Global Deserts Outlook reports. At risk animals include various species of [[w:Gazelle|Gazelle]], [[w:Oryx|Oryx]], [[w:Addax|Addax]], Arabian [[w:Tahr|Tahr]] and the [[w:Barbary sheep|Barbary sheep]] as well as one of the falconers favourite prey, the [[w:Houbara bustard|Houbara]]. "At greatest risk are the few patches of dry woodlands associated with desert mountain habitats which may decline by up to 3.5 per cent per year," said the study.

As a result of their valuable water supplies being diverted to domestic or agricultural use, desert wetlands, fed by the large rivers crossing deserts, are probably the most threatened ecosystem. Probable impacts include those created by roads, settlement expansion and other infrastructure developments around areas of desert montane. By 2050 the report estimates that  desert wilderness - those areas where there are no nearby roads - will decline from just under 60 per cent of the current total desert area to just over 30 per cent.

The pharmaceutical potential of desert plants has yet to be tapped, suggests the report. Scientists across the globe are analysing many desert plants for potential medicinal compounds - including anti-cancer and anti-malarial substances, antioxidants, as well as appetite suppressants.

==Impact of climate change==
[[Image:Wikinews tag globalwarming.png|right|150px]]
The [[w:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]], who advise governments and the United Nations, have reported that temperatures in deserts could rise by an average of as much as five to seven degrees by 2100. The problem, UNEP say, will almost certainly be compounded by the melting of glaciers - whose waters sustain many deserts. 

The impacts of climate change include the transformation of semi-arid rangelands into deserts, UNEP reports. They say water supplies are under threat from salinization and pollution by pesticides and herbicides, and that rising water tables beneath irrigated soils has led to more salinization of soils.

In some coastal areas ground-water supplies have been contaminated as seawater invades subsurface waters, the report shows. Large rivers that run through deserts have supported desert people for millennia, but many have been dammed, with water loss downstream having led to serious impacts on flood plains and river ecology.

Denunciations of Scandals Threaten UN
{{date|April 19, 2005}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|right|300px]]
Denunciations of corruption, bribe, collection of bribes from refugees [http://www.estadao.com.br/agestado/noticias/2002/jan/25/114.htm] and of sexual scandal involving the peacekeepers [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1413501,00.html], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4379971.stm] threaten the Organization of the United Nations (UN).

The gravest denunciations involve the aid project to [[w:Iraq|Iraq]], called [[w:Oil for Food|Oil-for-Food]].  Grave denunciations of bribe exist, superfluous accounting and collaboration with the ex-dictator [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]], against staff of the UN, companies and politicians of several countries.  Even the secretary of the UN, [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] was suspicious of participation in the plan of corruption.  And also grave doubts still hover about his son, Kojo Annan.

The gravity of the denunciations threatens not only the credibility of the UN, but its existence.

Secretary Kofi Annan said that he is going to promote reforms in the organization.  [http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-03-24-voa7.cfm]

==The Oil-for-Food Program==
[[Image:Rice on a plate.jpg|right|250px|thumb|
'''How Oil-for-Food should have functioned'''<br />
&mdash; Money from sales of Iraqi oil were deposited in an account, inaccessible by the government of Saddam Hussein.<br />
&mdash;Part of the money was used for invading Kuwait, another part was used to cover the expenses of coalition forces and the UN.  <br />
&mdash; The money that remained stayed available in the bill.  The government of the Iraq could use that money for buy sustenances, medicines and others property that went important for the Iraqi civil population.<br />
&mdash; The merchandise chosen by the government of Saddam should be analyzed.  If some of them went considerada as of military use, to be discarded.  Merchandise approved soon were sent for the Iraq.]]  The '''The Oil-for-Food Program''' was established by the [[w:UN|Organization of the United Nations]] in 1996 for permit that the [[w:Iraq|Iraq]] sold oil for the world market in change of food, medicines and others humane worthy supplies.  

The declared intention of the program was to help the Iraqi government guarantee the basic needs of the common Iraqi citizens, injured by imposed, international economic sanctions to the government in the mat of the first one [[w:Gulf War|Gulf War]], after the Iraq invaded the Kuwait in August of 1990, however, without permission that the country reconstructed its military forces.  

The Iraq refused the program in the beginning but afterwards signed a memo in May of 1996 for its implementation.  It programs him By By began in October of 1997, and the first delivers arrived in March of 1998.  

It programs By By used a trustee deposit system, by which the money of the sale of the oil of the Iraq I to be paid by the buyer in a not accessible bill straightly by the Iraqi government.  Of this money, a part served for pay indenizações by mischief caused to the [[w:Kuwait|Kuwait]], and another one breaks era for help in the payment of the expense of the forces of the coalition and others expense of the United Nation with the Iraq.  The remaining money remained in the bill.  

The Iraqi government had permission of buy merchandise that were not prohibited by the program and debit the corresponding values of that bill.

[[Image:Chirac ABr62200.jpeg|200px|right|thumb|French President Jacques Chirac, who was also involved in the scandal]]
Approximately 60 percent of the 26 millions of inhabitants of the Iraq depended only of the feeds of sustenance of him programs By By.  Provisions in the value moved closer to $27 billion destined for humane help were entregues to the Iraq.  

More of OR$65 billions in Iraqi oil were sold in the world market.  Around US$46 billions were used for guarantee the humane needs of the Iraqis, with food, medicines and others itens of humane help.  A total of 25 percent, from December of 2000, was spent with the repairs by the War of the Gulf by means of a bottom of compensation; 2,2 percent were operational and administrative expense of the United Nations with the program; and 0.8 percent were expense with the weapons inspection program.  

A short while before of the United States of the America and the British forces will invade the Iraq, the Secretary of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, suspended the program and evacuated more of 300 staffs that controlled the distribution of the provisions.  

In the day 28 of March of 2003, the Secretary Annan, the United States of the America, and the Great Britain asked to the [[w:Conselho of Security of the Security United|Advice Nations of the United Nations]] for assure that approximately US$10 billions in merchandise for the Iraq, that already had been ordered and approved, including US$2,4 billions in food, could be introduced in the country when the conditions permitted.  Others US$2,1 millions would be left for cover other needs of emergency of the civil Iraqis.  

The authorities of the UN estimate that 350 thousand refugees would be benefited, with property that would go since tents for shelter, to sustenances.  The resolution in argument cleared that the main responsibility by the humane consequences of the war would fall under the United States of the America and Great Britain, case they took the control of the country, second the Wednesday Convention of Genebra of 1949, about the responsibilities of the forces of occupation.  

The program formally enclosed his activities in 21 of November of 2003, and most of the deep was put under the control of the Coalition of Provisional Authority.  

Many they supported the program of intentions alegadamente humane, in the hope of that he of fact helped the Iraqis.  Some other persons criticked the program, in private after the fall of the regimen of Saddam Hussein, under the argument of that Saddam took advantage of the profits obtained by the sale of oil for maintain itself através of a plan of corruption that implicava staffs of several governments and of the UN.  

[[w:France|France]], [[w:Russia|Russia]] and [[w:China|China]] defended the expansion of the program.

==Reclamações==

Entre as orientações do programa,  estava uma que dizia que as receitas da venda do petróleo deveriam ser divididas de modo a proteger as regiões predominantemente curdas do Iraque.  Contudo, os [[w:Curdistão|curdos]] queixaram-se, desde a data de início do programa,  de que  eles não recebiam essas receitas adequadamente.

Houve  alegações de que o escritório no Cairo da [[w:Organização Mundial da Saúde|Organização Mundial da Saúde]], foi dirigido por um indivíduo que supostamente recebeu contratos de venda de petróleo, para em troca,   paralisar a construção de um novo hospital geral para a cidade curda de Sulaymaniyah, embora  os fundos para a construção desse hospital estivessem disponíveis desde 1988.

A partir de  Abril de 2004 [http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_04_25.php#002900], o programa começou a ser  alvo de acusações dos círculos conservadores norte-americanos, de que parte do dinheiro era ilegalmente desviada para o governo iraquiano. Foram feitas acusações de que parte do dinheiro era usada para subornar funcionários da ONU e até mesmo o secretário-geral Kofi Annan.

Segundo o relatório liberado no dia 3 de Fevereiro de 2005, pela comissão de investigação liderada por  Paul Volckers , o ex-presidente do Fed, Banco Central dos EUA, a maior parte dos alimentos fornecidos pelo programa "era inadequada para o consumo humano". Peter van Walsum, atualmente embaixador aposentado dos [[w:Países Baixos|Países Baixos]] para as Nações Unidas e  presidente do comitê de sanções do Iraque 1999-2000, especulou num livro recente que o Iraque deliberadamente dividiu o conselho de segurança concedendo contratos à França, [[w:Rússia|Rússia]], e  [[w:China|China]],  mas não ao [[w:Reino Unido|Reino Unido]] e aos Estados Unidos da América. Ele também afirmou que ele encontrou um número de casos nos quais sentia  que a falta da cooperação iraquiana tinha o objetivo propositado de exacerbar o sofrimento da sua própria gente. Ele também disse que,  em  sua opinião,  as sanções não eram uma alternativa  eficaz.

Benon Sevan, do [[w:Chipre|Chipre]], comandou o programa Petróleo-por-comida, e com convicção o defendeu. Ele  disse que  o programa teve só um custo administrativo de 2,2 %,  que passou por mais de 100 revisões (internas e externas), e culpou as restrições do Conselho de Segurança por ter dificultado a situação. Ele também disse que 90 % da população de Iraque confiava no programa de entrega mensal da cesta de  alimentos.

==Al-Mada==
[[Image:Al-Mada-Map-World.png|350px|right|thumb|Native countries of the institutions and individuals cited in Al-Mada (in green).]]
On January 25, 2004, ''Al-Mada'', a daily newspaper of the Iraq, published a [http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&Area=ia&ID=IA16404 list of 270 individuals and organizations] of several countries that would have received contracts of sale of oil by intermediary of the Oil-for-Food Program of the UN.  The list based itself in more of 15,000 documents that supposedly were found in the corporation of Iraqi state-owned oil, to which had connections with the Department of the Oil of Iraq.  

The Department of the Oil headed by ally Ahmed Chalabi, ex-member of the advice of government, that had been in the past widely critiqued until by his ex-apoiadores, by supply to the U.S.A. false information during the war.  The possible envolvement of Chalabi and to not possibility of corroborate the evidences put in doubt the accuracy of the list al-Mada.  

In the list of beneficiários of the al-Mada were the member of the British parliament, George Galloway, and to his entity of charity, the Bottom of Mariam; the ex-minister of the French interior Charles Pasqua, and the sheikh al-Kaffaji, a man of Iraqi business, that contributed with OR$400 thousand for produce a film that discredited the researches of weapons for the ex-inspecting one of the UN Scott.  Many Russian firms and important individuals also were included in the list of the al-Mada.  To even the Russian Orthodox Church was supposedly implicada in the illegal commerce of oil.  George Galloway subsequently earned two actions of defamation against the Christian Science Monitor and the Daily Telegraph that reportaram the accusations.  Of Brazil, there were two names in the list.  The first one of them was the name of a such of Fuad Sirhan, and another name was supposedly of some organization called Movement 8 of October (Chávez).  Nobody of Portugal appears in the list.  

They appear in the list the names of the chief executive (I DINE), Patrick Maugein, of the company I Punch International, that supposedly is enough connected to the French president [[w:Jacques Chirac|Jacques Chirac]]; of the French ex-ambassador for the UN, Jean-Bernard; and the name president of the Indonesia Megawati Sukarnoputri.  

In an interview for the Financial Teams, the sheikh al-Kaffaji, that appears in the list, admitted that received and sold contratos of Iraqi oil for the Italtech, a company of Italian oil-producing commerce, that by his time resold the oil for the company Bayoil, that stayed in Houston, in the U.S.A.  Khafaji said that the ex-inspecting one of the UN Scott Ritter swims to know about those activities.  

Arthur Millholland, the president of the Oilexco Ltd, whose name also appeared in the list of Al-Mada denied any envolvement in illicit activities, but admitted the accusations of that illegal surcharges were payment to the Iraqi government by contractors.  [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040423/ROIL23/TPBusiness/TopStories] 

Of any form, the list of al-Mada does not mention exactly the payment of bribes to the government of the Iraq.  She quotes paid bribes to individuals for that these supported the Iraqi regimen.  Few they deny that in the Iraq, as in many countries of third world, bribes regularly are paid the leaderships for acquire contracts.  But some they suggest that you have bribes normally would not occur in you have countries when a program in execution of the UN was involved.

==Funcionanento do esquema de corrupção==
[[Image:Iraq-oil-power.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Oil refinery in Iraq]]
Algumas companhias superfaturavam em até 10% as contas,  e parte do dinheiro era desviada para as contas bancárias privadas de Saddam Hussein ou outros funcionários do regime.  Parte do dinheiro ficava com as próprias companhias.

Segundo se alega, o esquema de corrupção funcionava assim:
# os contratos de petróleo  pelo programa Petróleo-por-comida eram oferecidos somente a indivíduos e organizações simpáticas ao regime iraquiano, ou somente  para aqueles que poderiam ser facilmente subornados. 
# os contratos então eram  vendidos no mercado mundial  e  o vendedor podia ficar com  uma taxa da transação da venda do petróleo,  algo em torno de 0,15 a 0,50 de dólares por barril (0,94 a 3,14 dólares por metro cúbico),  segundo se calcula. 
# em seguida, o vendedor  reembolsava o governo iraquiano com uma porcentagem de comissão.

Estimativas mostram que Saddam Hussein usou o programa da ONU para juntar 21 bilhões de dólares a fim de subornar políticos estrangeiros para apoiar decisões contrárias aos EUA e financiar organizações terroristas. Pelo menos 74 milhões de dólares do programa Petróleo-por-comida foram direto para o [[w:Hamas|Hamas]]. Há suspeitas de que parte do dinheiro tenha ido para a organização [[w:Al Qaeda|Al Qaeda]]. [http://www.forward.com/issues/2003/03.06.20/news2.html]

Em  Fevereiro,  depois que o nome de Benon Sevan, o diretor executivo do programa de Petróleo-por-comida, apareceu nos documentos do Ministério de Petróleo do Iraque, tornou-se evidente o possível envolvimento das Nações Unidas no caso. 

Supõe-se que  Sevan tenha recebido em propinas  pelo menos 11 000 000 de barris (1 700 000 m ³) de petróleo. Em dinheiro isto corresponde a cerca de 3.5 bilhões de dólares. Benon Sevan negou as acusações.

== As investigações==

Em 2000, Dileep Nair, vice-secretário-geral e diretor do gabinete que investiga os casos de ilegalidades na ONU, desejou determinar a vulnerabilidade do programa. Benon Sevan,  chefe do programa Petróleo-por-comida,  e  a subsecretária-geral   Louise Frechette rejeitaram toda e qualquer investigação sob a alegação de que ela seria muito cara e que não valeria a pena.

Enquanto Benon Sevan esteve na chefia do Petróleo-por-comida,  ele rejeitou os esforços para rever e investigar o programa.
Ele rencomendou o seu pessoal que as reclamações sobre pagamentos ilegais deviam ser formalmente arquivadas com o país do reclamente,  e que devia ser permitido  ao Iraque  barrar qualquer denúncia.

===Investigation of Charles Duelfer for the Central Intelligence Agency===
[[Image:Charles Duelfer.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Charles Duelfer testifies before Congress about the corruption of the Oil-for-Food Program]]  On September 30, 2004, the report of special counselor Charles Duelfer of the Central Intelligence Agency ([[w:CIA|CIA]]), was released.  The report described the impact of the Oil-for-Food Program on the regime of Saddam Hussein:

:''The introduction of the Oil-for-Food Program in 1996 was key step in the turnaround of the regime.  It rescued the economy of Baghdad of a decline terminal created by the sanctions.  The regime quickly perceived that the program would be able to to be corrupted in order to acquire change foreigner so much for mine the sanctions, as much as for supply the meanses for improve to infrastructure of double utility and the development of potential weapons of mass destruction in batter.''  [volume I, page 1]

Second the report of Charles Duelfer, Saddam received an estimated of $1.7 billion, outside of the control of the UN, between 1997 and 2003.  Duelfer also said it's possible that Benon Sevan has received bribes of the plan with the oil.

===GAO Investigation===
After the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the victory of the Coalition over the Iraqi army, The General Accounting Office (GAO) &mdash; General Office of American Accounting &mdash; had the task of finalize all the contratos related upon programming By By, after the fall of the Iraqi regimen.  Was responsibility of him also track the fortunes of all of the ex members of the government of the Iraq [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04651t.pdf].  During this task, the General Office found you fail in the program that permitted the existence of bribes and other forms of help for Saddam Hussein.  He calculates that the regimen of Saddam Hussein generated $10.1 billion in illegal prescriptions.  This number I included $5.7 billion of contrabando of oil and $4.4 billion in illicit surcharges about sales of oil and shipments powders-sell about fornecedores.  

More latter to scale of the fraud revealed be been much more extensive than the General Office of American Accounting intially had calculated.  A study of Department of the Defense of the U.S.A., cited by the General Office, evaluated 759 contratos administered by the Oil-for-Food program and concluded that barely half had been fabricated, by a margin of 21 percent [http://www.gao.gov/highlights/d04579thigh.pdf].  

It can be well-read in the summary of the report of the General Office of American Accounting: :''Tanto the secretary of the UN, através of the office of the as much as Iraqi program the Advice of Security, através of his committee of sanctions to the Iraq, were responsible by supervise programs him By By.  However, the Iraqi government negotiated straightly contratos with buyers of Iraqi oil and fornecedores of commodities, what may have been an important factor that permitted to the Iraq charge illegal surcharges and commissions.''  

Before of staffs of the United Nations will have promised full cooperation with the inquiry from the of the General Office of American Accounting, Joseph A.  The Christoff, director of international business and commerce of the GAO, said that auditores of the UN had refused it liberate the internal audits of him programs By By [http://washingtontimes.com/world/20040429-120918-1334r.htm].  

Benon Sevan, leader of programs By By, with support of Kofi Annan, wrote letters for all of the ex contractors of programs By By asking that consulted Sevan before of liberate any documents for of the General Office of American Accounting, or panels of inquiry of the Congress of the United States of the America [http://edition.cnn.com/2004/US/05/03/un.oil.for.food.letter/].  

By all his history, the program received complaints of that he was necessary be clearer and claims of companies about revelations of private information.  

The UN denied all petitions deeds by the General Office of American Accounting for obtain access to confidential internal audits of him programs By By.  

While tried to decide to complexity of the Oil-for-Food program, in an article for the periodic one The New York Teams, to journalist investigativa Claudia Rosett, of the Foundation in Defense of the Democracy ([http://www.defenddemocracy.org Foundation will go the Defense of Democracies]) and of the Institute Hudson, uncovered that details of I hire of the UN, as the identities of the contractors of programs By By, the price, the quantity and quality That were received were confidential information.  The banking extracts, the payments performed and the transactions also were maintained in secret [http://reform.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Rosett%20Testimony--%20(cleaned%20up%20version).pdf].  

"That money [of the Oil-for-Food program] was in secret, devious for you count banking illicit, outside of the Iraq and bingo: Saddam had access to the money of outside of the country, despite of the sanctions" [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,133087,00.html] , said Rosset in interview for the Foundation in Defense of the Democracy and for a collaborator of the Fox News.  

Rosett harshly was criticked by Dennis Halliday, that of 1997 to 1998 coordinated the humane help of the UN for the Iraq [http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0403/19/i_dl.01.html], and Benon Sevan [http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0305/04/i_dl.01.html].  Both they affirmed that many of the statements of Rossett were incorrect, as to that says that programs By By financed the approval of an Olympic stadium, or to that affirms that the responsibility by several questions of the program differ from resolutions of the UN.  

The House Committee on International Relations investigated the Oil-for-Food program and uncovered that between 15 million and 25 million dollars in cash of the program was used by Sabah Yassen, ex-ambassador to Iraq for [[w:Jordan|Jordan]], in order to pay the Palestinian families of suicidal terrorists.  From September of 2000 up to the invasion of the Iraq, the families of Palestinians dead or injured in the conflict with Israel (including the 117 responsible for suicidal attacks against Israel) received more of $35 millions.

=== As investigações do  conselho de governo iraquiano===
[[Image:Flag of Iraq.svg|right|200px]]
O conselho de governo iraquiano selecionou a empresa internacional de auditoria KPMG e a firma  especializada em direito de empresas internacionais Freshfield Bruckhaus Deringer  para investigar as alegações do jornal al-Mada. Ambas deveriam ter divulgado suas conclusões em Maio de 2004. Todavia, em Junho de 2004, a KPMG parou de trabalhar no projeto por falta de pagamento do conselho do governo iraquiano  [http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/003120.php].

Os Estados Unidos da América criticaram duramente a investigação da KPMG liderada por sócios de Ahmed Chalabi, e acusaram-no de sabotar a investigação principal iniciada por Paul Bremer. Aquela investigação foi liderada pelo chefe  do Conselho Supremo de Auditores Independentes do Iraque, Ehsan Karim, com a ajuda da Ernst & Young. Em Junho de 2004, a investigação de Karim concordou em compartilhar informações com a comissão montada por Volcker. Entretanto, em 1 de Julho de 2004, Karim  foi assassinado por uma bomba magnética colocada em seu carro [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3855803.stm].

Claude Hankes-Drielsma, um britânico amigo de longa-data de Ahmed Chalabi foi escolhido pelo conselho do governo iraquiano para coordenar as investigações do programa Petróleo-por-comida. Drielsma testemunhou perante o Congresso dos EUA em 21 de Abril de 2004 e disse que a investigação conduzida pela KPMG esperava provar a clara ligação entre aqueles países que estavam prontos a fornecer apoio ao regime de Saddam Hussein em troca de benefícios financeiros, às custas do povo iraquiano, e aqueles que se opuseram às aplicações das sanções contra o Iraque e deposição de Saddam. Ele também testemunho que Chalabi estava no comando das investigações para o conselho do governo iraquiano.

No final de Maio de 2004, no mesmo dia em que os escritórios de Chalabi no Congresso Nacional Iraquiano eram revistados pelas forças de coalião, Drielsma alegou que um indivíduou, ou indivíduos, entraram em seu computador e apagaram todos os arquivos relacionados com a sua investigação. Ele também disse que um arquivo de backup  havia sido apagado.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/06/06/wirq06.xml&sSheet=/news/2004/06/06/ixworld.html]

Quando a jornalista Claudia Rosette perguntou-lhe se ele tinha sofrido ameaças físicas também, Drielsma retrucou com sem comentários. Drielsma também foi um crítico ferrenho da recusa por parte da ONU em tornar pública as informações internas da auditoria do programa Petróleo-por-comida para o conselho de governo iraquiano.

===Investigação das Nações Unidas===
[[Image:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|right|250px|thumb|UN Headquarters in New York]]
No dia 19 de Março de 2004,  o secretário-geral de Nações Unidas,  Kofi Annan voltou atrás e disse que realizaria uma investigação completa sobre o Programa Petróleo-por-comida.  Numa entrevista, o secretário-geral disse: "É altamente provável que tenha havido bastante irregularidades, mas necessitamos investigar [...] e ver quem foi o  responsável". [[Image:Loudspeaker.png]] [http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/pressconference/so040319.rm?start=%2200:00:03%22   áudio] 

Annan porém acrescentou que a maioria das denúncias eram "ultrajantes e exageradas [http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/28/iraq.un.oil.reut/]. Segundo ele a maior parte  das críticas eram sobre questões  não relacionadas ao programa.

Apenas seis auditores internos  da ONU foram inicialmente designados para fiscalizar o programa Petróleo-por-comida.  As recomendações da ONU  dizem  que pelo menos 12 auditores devem trabalhar na fiscalização de programas que gastam mais de 1 bilhão de dólares, como por exemplo, o Petróleo-por-comida.  Mesmo assim, os auditores internos encontraram várias irregularidades, entre elas: a compra de 287 computadores por  870 mil dólares para os escritórios em [[w:Bagdá|Bagdá]], sendo que 100 computadores estavam a mais e não teriam uso nos escritórios; gasto considerado exorbitante de 47 mil dólares com móveis para o escritório em Bagdá, pagamento anual de 500 mil dólares para o governo iraquiano para pagar por inspetores de construções, que nunca trabalharam para a ONU; compra de seis geradores de energia elétrica a diesel, mesmo sendo difícil obter  diesel  na região o que seria a um custo de 10 milhões de dólares; foram gastos uma quantia considerada exagerada de 500 mil dólares com suprimentos de inverno, como roupas,  para a população do Iraque.[http://www.theage.com.au/news/Iraq/Oilforfood-audits-tell-of-millions-lost/2005/01/11/1105423481900.html?oneclick=true]  

Parte da auditoria interna da ONU vazou e apareceu no ''website'' mineweb.com.  O relatório que vazou mostrava grandes discrepâncias  entre os relatórios da empresa suíça Cotecna e os relatórios das agências da ONU,  quanto a valores de transportes para a região norte do Iraque.

Para a auditoria  a Cotecna não fez nenhuma inspeção "de valor" sobre quase 1 bilhão de dólares de remessas de ajuda para o Programa Humanitário da Interagência no norte iraquiano.  O responsável pelo programa,  Benon Sevan,    foi   informado das descobertas da auditoria em  Dezembro de 2002  [http://washingtontimes.com/world/20040520-121412-9548r.htm].

A auditoria está disponível [http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/un_oilforfood_audit.pdf aqui]. Seu resumo diz: 
:''A conclusão total da OIO é que a gerência do contrato não foi adequada e certos regulamentos do contrato não foram seguidos. Além do mais, a incorporação de custos adicionais, tal como reabilitação de acampamentos contados em dias-homem  foi uma disposição inaceitável. Também, o contrato  foi remendado antes de seu início, o que foi  impróprio. O OIP tem de fortalecer o seu gerenciamento de contratos e o Setor de Atividade de Suprimento deve assegurar que a base do pagamento é apropriada para evitar custos adicionais à organização.''

Depois de ler o relatório de auditoria, o congressista americano Henry Hyde escreveu para Kofi Annan e perguntou  por que "o Congresso de Estados Unidos,   responsável por  22 por cento do orçamento do ONU  e que solicitou publicamente as cópias de 55 auditorias  internas,  precisou  depender de vazamentos de meios de comunicação para ter acesso aos documentos."

Um painel independente de inquérito das Nações Unidas foi criado em abril de 2004. Foram designados para dirigir esse painel de investigação: o ex-presidente do Fed (Banco Central dos EUA)  Paul Volcker;  Richard Goldstone  da África do Sul e ex-promotor do Tribunal Internacional Criminal da ex-Iugoslávia e do Tribunal Internacional de [[w:Ruanda|Ruanda]];  e   Mark Pieth, da Suíca, especialista em finanças da ''Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development'' (OECD).

Em  22 de abril de 2004, o Conselho de Segurança de Organização das Nações Unidas passou uma resolução unânime que endossou  o inquérito de Volcker sobre corrupção no programa Petróleo-por-comida para o Iraque e pediu a colaboração dos  191 estados membros. [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/22/international/middleeast/22CND-NATI.html]

== Last reports so far ==
On a initial report of 219 pages, the commission of Volcker registers that Benon Sevan used his position to make and receive request of Iraqi oil during the years that he supervised the program<!-- de alívio humanitário -->.

Internal documents of SOMO (Iraq 's State Oil Marketing Organization) as well as interviews with Iraqi ex-employees involved in illicit selling of oil, show that Sevan had requested and had received allocations of 7.3 millions barrels of oil in the name of a company registered in Panama called African Middle East Petroleum Co.
<!--
Registros internos de SOMO (Iraq 's State Oil Marketing Organization) assim como entrevistas com ex-funcionários iraquianos envolvidos em negócios ilícitos de petróleo, mostram que Sevan tinha solicitado e tinha recebido alocações de 7.3 milhões de barris de petróleo  em nome de uma companhia de comércio registrada do Panamá chamada African Middle East Petroleum Co.
-->

Although the report does not make a specific allegation of criminal activity by Sevan, Volcher does not exclude the possibility that the accusations have been filed by authorities in countries with relevant jurisdiction.
<!--
Embora o relatório não faça nenhuma alegação específica de atividade criminal por Sevan, Volcker não exclui a possibilidade de as acusações terem sido arquivadas por autoridades em países com jurisdição relevante.
-->

O relatório chamou a conduta de Sevan "eticamente imprópria anotando que Sevan tinha recebido grandes  pagamentos à vista que totalizam 160 mil dólares por cada ano durante o qual ele tinha sido chefe  do programa. O Sevan diz que o dinheiro veio de uma tia no  Chipre morreu, mas a comissão de investigação não achou nenhuma evidência para apoiar esta afirmação.

Volcker também informou em Janeiro que uma revisão de 58 auditorias confidenciais da ONU sobre o programa  mostrou que funcionários da ONU igonoraram precocemente sinais de que as mercadorias despachadas pela companhia suíca Cotecna para o Iraque antes da invasão de 2003 foram pouco inspecionadas, se é que foram inspecionadas. A Cotecna pagou a Kojo Annan, o filho do secretário-geral da ONU,  Kofi Annan, taxas  de  consultoria, até  Novembro de 2003. Volcker disse que os futuros relatórios deveriam tratar as questões relacionadas Kojo Annan [http://www.iic-offp.org/documents/InterimReportFeb2005.pdf].

O secretário-geral da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) general Kofi Annan foi absolvido pelo relatório da comissão de Volcker,  dia 29 de Março  das acusações de que ele teria usado sua influência para conceder contratos no Iraque à companhia suíça Cotecna Inspection Services , onde trabalhava seu filho Kojo Annan.

Kofi Annan porém é questionado  por não ter investigado melhor as operações relacionadas a seu filho Kojo. E dois membros de seu pessoal, Iqbal Riza e Dileep Nair, foram criticados  no relatório da comissão Volcker. Riza alegadamente rasgou documentos relacionados aos contratos na investigação depois que o secretário-geral rencomendou que eles fossem guardados. O jornal The New York Times disse que Nair foi "fraudulento" ao indicar uma pessoa que quase não tinha experiência para um posto de grande responsabilidade do programa Petróleo-por-comida.

O filho do secretário-geral, Kojo, também foi  bastante criticado pelo relatório, que diz que ele "enganou intencionalmente o secretário-geral" sobre a sua ligação financeira com a empresa suíça. E acrescenta: "Questões significativas permanecem a respeito de Kojo e de suas ações durante o outono [boreal] de 1998, assim como da integridade de seus negócios e transações financeiras com respeito ao programa Petróleo por comida."

Kofi Annan recebeu pressões  para renunciar, todavia ele disse que não fará isso.[http://author.voanews.com/english/2005-03-29-voa66.cfm]

Dia 14 de Abril, o texano David Chalmers, proprietário da empresa  Bayoil Inc, de [[w:Hounston|Hounston]] e que participou do programa da ONU, foi preso e indiciado, acusado de ter pago milhões de dólares para o regime de Saddam Hussein e de usar dinheiro do programa Petróleo-por-comida. [http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/14/oilfood.indictment/]
Também foram indiciados um  búlgaro residente dos  EUA,  chamado Ludmil Dionisiev, um britânico chamado  John Irving e um  sul-coreano identificado como Tongsun Park.

Os promotores dos EUA que investigam o caso acusaram Tongsun Park de tentar influenciar autoridades da ONU. Eles dizem que Park encontrou-se com duas autoridades de elevado posto da ONU nos anos 90 e que recebeu dois milhões de dólares por seu trabalho.

Funcionários da ONU admitiram que o ex-secretário-geral Boutros Boutros-Ghali tinha uma grande amizade com Tongsun Park e que eles se encontraram por diversas vezes durante os anos noventa, que era a época em que se acertavam os detalhes do programa Petróleo-por-comida.

Um alto funcionário da ONU, Maurice Strong, admitiu que manteve relações com o sul-coreano Tongsun Park.  Strong confirmou que Tongsun Park investiu numa empresa de energia da qual Strong  fazia parte, em 1997. Todavia, Strong  disse que o investimento foi uma relação comercial normal e que não tinha nenhuma relação com o Iraque. 

Maurice Strong é um conselheiro próximo do secretário-geral da ONU  Kofi Annan. Em entrevista para a  agência de notícias VOA, Koffi Anan disse que desconhecia qualquer relacionamento financeiro entre Strong e Park.[http://author.voanews.com/english/2005-04-19-voa70.cfm]

United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions on North Korea
[[Image:LocationNorthKorea.png|right|top|250px|thumb|North Korea]]
[[Image:UN_security_council_2005.jpg|right|top|250px|thumb|UN Security Council Chamber New York]]

{{date|July 15, 2006}}

The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] has unanimously voted to impose sanctions related to weapons on [[North Korea]].

The resolution demands that North Korea 'suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program.

The resolution requires all {{w|United Nations member states|UN member states}} to prevent imports from or exports to North Korea of missiles and missile-related items as well as materials that could be used in {{w|WMD|weapons of mass destruction.}}

However, in order to keep [[China]] from vetoing the resolution, the resolution was not passed under {{w|Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter 7}} of the {{w|U.N. Charter}}, which is used on a legally binding document. However, the resolution is considered mandatory because of the way it is worded. 

China and [[Russia]] proposed a resolution with weaker language, but later agreed to this tougher resolution.

North Korean ambassador to UN {{w|Pak Kil-yon}} spoke after the vote and criticized some members of the Security Council for attempting to isolate [[North Korea]]. He also vowed that North Korea will continue with its missile testings.

Speculation grows in race to succeed Kofi Annan
{{date|August 14, 2006}}

South Korean foreign minister [[w:Ban Ki Moon|Ban Ki Moon]] and UN undersecretary [[w:Shashi Tharoor|Shashi Tharoor]] of India are the early leaders in the race to succeed [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] [[w:Secretary General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] who retires at the end of this year. 

In late July the 15 members of the [[w:United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] conducted a secret straw poll on who should succeed Annan. Monday's edition of the ''[[w:The Guardian|the Guardian]]'' newspaper reports the leaked results which have Ban leading with 12 "encourages", 1 "discourage" and 2 "no opinions" ahead of Tharoor's 10 "encourages", 2 "discourages" and 3 "no opinions". The other two official candidates thus far are Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister [[w:Surakiart Sathirathai|Surakiart Sathirathai]] and former U.N. disarmament chief [[w:Jayantha Dhanapala|Jayantha Dhanapala]] from Sri Lanka. Prime Minister [[w:Goh Chok Tong|Goh Chok Tong]] of Singapore is also a possible contender, according to ''the Guardian'' but has not officially declared his interest. 

Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] of New Zealand dismissed a report, Monday, that she was lobbying for the position calling it "a piece of fiction". The ''New Zealand Herald'' reported in its weekend edition that Clark had sought support for her possible candidacy from British Prime Minister [[w:Tony Blair|Tony Blair]] during a recent visit to London.

Coincidentally, Ban was in Auckland Monday seeking New Zealand's support for his bid. New Zealand Foreign Minister [[w:Winston Peters|Winston Peters]] met with Ban but made no public comment on his country's position on the contest. 

Traditionally, the position of Secretary-General rotates among the continents suggesting that Annan's successor will likely be an Asian, the first since [[w:U Thant|U Thant]] filled the post from 1961 to 1971.

India may pull peacekeeping troops out of Lebanon
{{date|August 24, 2006}}
{{India}}
Defence Minister [[w:Pranab Mukherjee|Pranab Mukherjee]] has said [[w:India|India]] may withdraw the 775 troops it has stationed in [[w:Lebanon|Lebanon]] as part of  the 1,990-strong [[w:United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]]. 

A new U.N force, comprising of troops from Italy, France and other nations is being organised to act as a buffer between Israeli forces and [[Hezbollah]], following the recent conflict between the two. Diplomatic sources say the withdrawal decision may have been taken because the new mandate involves ''peace-enforcement'' as opposed to ''peace-keeping''. India, which is currently the second-largest troop-contributor to U.N peacekeeping operations, will wait till the expiry of the current mandate on 31st August before handing over its positions to the new force. The contingent from the [[w:Sikh Regiment|4th Sikh Battalion]] is currently engaged in rescue and rehabilitation work following the recent weeks of conflict, in which one of its peacekeepers was critically injured by shrapnel from an Israeli shell.

Security Council backs ceasefire in Israel-Lebanon conflict
{{date|August 12, 2006}}

{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
The [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] has unanimously approved {{w|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|Resolution 1701}} calling for a "full cessation of hostilities" in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|Israeli-Lebanon war]] and for international and Lebanese troops to replace Israeli troops in south Lebanon.

The UN decree comes on the heels of an Israeli government decision to expand its offensive in Lebanon. Sources say that Israeli prime minister [[Ehud Olmert]] will bring the UN resolution to cabinet for discussion on Sunday. Daniel Ayalon, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said that his government was likely to agree to the resolution.

"I do not want to preempt the Cabinet decision, but the language as I see it now &mdash; and I'm being careful &mdash; if the language of the resolution doesn't change, I view this resolution very positively and, of course, the crux is implementation," Ayalon said. "If this resolution will be enforced, then we solve the problem of Lebanon," said the Israeli envoy.

[[Hezbollah]] officials have not responded to the UN action. The Lebanese cabinet meets Saturday to discuss the resolution.

Lebanese leaders have cautiously welcomed the resolution which had been delayed for almost a week due to negotiations over its wording. U.N. Ambassador Nouhad Mahmoud of Lebanon said; "The Lebanese are not comfortable with the Israeli distinctions of what is defensive and what is offensive." 

The resolution calls for [[Hezbollah]] to end its attacks on Israel and for Israel to end "offensive military operations" in Lebanon. It also raises the strength of the UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, the {{w|United Nations Interim Force}} (Unifil), from 2,000 to a maximum of 15,000, and gives it an expanded mandate to enforce the ceasefire. A portion of the UN language expanding that force's Chapter 6 mandate reads: ''"Acting in support of a request from the government of Lebanon to deploy an international force to assist it to exercise its authority throughout the territory, authorizes Unifil to take all necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces and as it deems within its capabilities, to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind... "''

The U.S. Secretary of State, [[Condoleezza Rice]], responding on Friday during an interview with ''{{w|CNN|CNN's}}'' {{w|Wolf Blitzer}} to the difference between a UN Chapter 7 mandate, and the current mandate for Unifil in Lebanon said: <blockquote>So this force has a big mandate, it has a robust mandate, it has a mandate that will allow it to defend itself and to defend that mandate. But it's never been the expectation that this force is going to disarm Hezbollah. That will have to be done by the Lebanese...<br><br>...Chapter 7 is very often used when a government is not prepared to accept a force. Lebanon is prepared to accept this force, but this is an absolutely robust mandate. This, by the way, is what helped the Israeli government. They were concerned earlier about the mandate. After we talked about this enhanced mandate in the revised resolution, I think the government of Israel saw that it met their needs.</blockquote>
 
Israel is to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon as UN and Lebanese troops are deployed. The resolution outlines plans for the disarmament of Hezbollah and for a settlement of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
 
The UN also called for the unconditional release by Hezbollah of two Israeli soldiers it captured on July 12th, precipitating the conflict.

123 Israelis, including 40 civilians, and 861 Lebanese, mostly civilians, have been killed in the 31-day old war.

India's Secretary-General candidate Tharoor suggests UN reform agenda
{{date|August 29, 2006}}
{{India}}
India's nominee for the post of [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] of the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]], [[w:Shashi Tharoor|Shashi Tharoor]] has revealed a four-point plan to tackle the problems the international body is facing. He said that the biggest hurdle faced by the UN is that it has to deal with a large number of issues at the same time. The United Nations with its "impressive achievements and "haunting failures has changed but needs to change further" he said in an article in ''[[w:Newsweek International|Newsweek International]]''. 

Tharoor's proposal is concentrated on four areas- making democracy a priority; bolstering the ranks (of the United Nations); prioritising and streamlining; and healing wounds. He talked about the crisis in the Middle East, and the nuclear standoff between the U.N and countries like North Korea and Iran, referring to them as "obvious and trying". He also pointed out "problems without passports" such as climate change, narcotics smuggling  and human rights violations. Tharoor, a leading candidate to succeed [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]], said that strengthening the capacities of both the UN and its member-states was the best way to deal with these problems.

Tharoor stated that further efforts were needed to promote democracy and good governance the world over. "We now have a Democracy Fund to help us do that, financed not just by the rich West but by countries like India," he said. He also pointed out that the UN should try and stand up more for human rights by making sure the [[w:Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] did its job more effectively than the "over-politicised" [[w:Human Rights Commission|Human Rights Commission]] it replaced. He said the UN should support the efforts bodies like [[w:NATO|NATO]] and the [[w:EU|EU]] were making in their peacekeeping. Tharoor also spoke about the conflict in Iraq, saying "And where the task, like enforcing peace in Iraq, is clearly beyond us (the UN), we should let wars be fought by warriors, not peacekeepers,"

In reference to "healing wounds", he pointed out the danger of the [[w:Cold War|Cold War]] divisions being replaced by a North-South divide at the UN "The new secretary-general must urgently combat this. I would focus on building issue-based coalitions to deal with specific practical problems (things like management inefficiencies, procurement policies, information technology, outsourcing) that have little to do with ideological politics," he said.

Tharoor is currently the UN's Under Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information. He and South Korean Foreign Minister [[w:Ban Ki Moon|Ban Ki Moon]] are considered frontrunners in the race to succeed Annan, whose term ends at the end of the year. Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister [[w:Surakiart Sathirathai|Surakiart Sathirathai]] and former UN disarmament chief [[w:Jayantha Dhanapala|Jayantha Dhanapala]] from Sri Lanka are also official candidates for the top UN job.

Annan: Israel violates cease-fire
{{date|August 19, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
Israel violated resolution 1701 yesterday when troops from the Matkal, a special forces elite unit, launched a commando raid near the [[Hezbollah]] stronghold of Baalbek, in the Beka valley, according to Kofi Annan. One Israeli soldier was killed and two injured. Three Hezbollah members were killed according to Lebanese security officials.

Spokesman Mark Regev defended the action, saying "Israel reserves the right to act in order to enforce the spirit of the [UN] resolution,". The resolution called for a cessation of all hostilities, and an arms embargo. The Israeli Prime minister, Ehud Olmert justified the attack, stating that it was intended to prevent the supply of new weapons and ammunition to Hezbollah.

"The Secretary-General is deeply concerned about a violation by the Israeli side of the cessation of hostilities as laid out in Security Council resolution 1701," said a UN spokesperson. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general said violations of the resolution like Israel's "endanger the fragile calm that was reached after much negotiation and undermine the authority of the Government of Lebanon." He called on all parties "to respect strictly the arms embargo, exercise maximum restraint, avoid provocative actions and display responsibility in implementing resolution 1701."

Annan demands Hezbollah free abducted soldiers and Israel lift blockade
{{date|August 31, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
[[w:United Nations|United Nations]] [[w:Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary General]] [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] called on [[w:Hezbollah|Hezbollah]], Monday, to release the two [[w:Israel|Israeli]] soldiers who were captured on July 12.

Annan also urged Israel to lift its air and sea blockade of Lebanon faulting it for not meeting the requirements of the [[w:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559|UN resolution]] governing the 15 day old ceasefire. The UN leader made his comments in [[w:Beirut|Beirut]] following talks with Lebanese Prime Minister [[w:Fuad Saniora|Fuad Saniora]].

"It's a fixed menu. . . . It's not an a la carte menu where you choose and pick," said Annan of the ceasefire provisions and the failure of both sides to fulfill them. He said that the truce had created the opportunity for a "long-term ceasefire and a long-term peace" but that all sides of the conflict had to fully implement the UN Security Council resolution for that to occur. 

Israel responded to Annan's comments by saying it intended to continue the blockade until international forces are deployed along Lebanon's border with [[w:Syria|Syria]] and other entry points in order to stop arms shipments to Hezbollah. 

"Once the international forces are fully in place and they're able to prevent the smuggling of weapons to Hezbollah, there will be no need for the air and naval blockade," said David Baker speaking on behalf of Israeli Prime Minister [[w:Ehud Olmert|Ehud Olmert]]. 

===Addresses Syrian concerns===

Annan said that the Lebanese army, not the international force, should have the responsibility of policing the border with Syria saying that the deployment of peacekeeping troops on the border of two countries that have not been at war would be unprecedented. Syrian President [[w:Bashar Assad|Bashar Assad]] has said having international forces on the country's border would be a "hostile" act. 

He stressed that southern Lebanon must become an arms free zone, "In Lebanon, there should be - as we have all agreed - one law, one authority, one gun," he said, and that the disarmament of Hezbollah must be achieved by national agreement within Lebanon and could not be implemented by international forces.   

Annan's visit to Lebanon is the first leg of a tour of the Middle East aimed at propping up the ceasefire. He will also be visiting Israel, Syria, the [[w:Palestinian Territories|Palestinian Territories]] and [[w:Iran|Iran]].

Security Council set to adopt non-binding text on N. Korea
{{date|October 6, 2006}}
{{North Korea nuclear program}}
The [[UN Security Council]] will "mostly likely" adopt a non-binding statement later today on [[North Korea|North Korea's]] announcement of planned nuclear bomb tests; the statement does not explicitly mention the threat of sanctions. This was announced by the Security Council president late yesterday.

[[Japan|Japan's]] UN envoy Kenzo Oshima, who chairs the 15-member body this month, said council experts made "good progress" in efforts to fine tune a Japanese draft, but said they had yet to finalize it.

"Most likely we will have something adopted (Friday)" once council members consult their respective capitals for "final clearance," he added.

Earlier on Thursday, Japan and the [[United States]] pushed for a threat to resort to mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This would includes arms, trade, and economic embargoes. [[China]] and [[Russia]] (two veto members of the Council) however, voted against the sanctions.

It is hoped that the latest text will urge Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear tests and return back to six-party talks "without precondition". North Korea had earlier boycotted the talks in response to a sanction placed by the US on one of its banks, believed to linked to the regime of {{w|Kim Jong-Il}}.

North Korea claims it has nuclear weapons, although this has not yet been independently verified.

Six Power Meetings confirmed on Iran's nuclear crisis
{{date|October 6, 2006}}
{{Iran nuclear program}}
Foreign ministers seeking to resolve [[Iran|Iran's]] nuclear crisis will meet in London today at 5P.M. local time (1600hrs GMT). The countries sending their foreign ministers are [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Russia]]. The participating nations, with the exception of Germany, have veto powers in the [[w:UN Security Council|UN Security Council]].

The UN Security Council is also likely to meet next week to discuss further action to take against Iran, following its failure to persuade Iran to freeze its uranium enrichment program.

Many western governments suspect that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capability. Iran insists that the enriched uranium is meant for power generation only.

Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, and European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana have executed four rounds of negotiations on Iran's nuclear program but have failed to make a breakthrough.

Solana's representative, Cristina Gallach, stressed the current diplomatic efforts were different from a European initiative in 2004-05, which ultimately failed.

"The offer of November 2004 was only one and a half pages long and only had the Europeans' signature, while the June 2006 offer has the signature of the whole Security Council and Germany," she said.

"The Americans are very much on board. It is a truly robust international offer."

The [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] has recommended the [[South Korea]]n foreign minister [[Ban Ki-moon]] for appointment as the next {{w|United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General}} of the United Nations.

Kenzo Oshima, [[Japan]]ese Ambassador to the United Nations expressed a hope that the Assembly presidency will act rapidly to elect him.

UN security council to vote on North Korean sanctions
{{date|October 14, 2006}}
{{North Korea nuclear program}}
The {{w|United Nations security council}} is expected to vote later today on whether to impose {{w|sanctions}} on [[North Korea]] after the country announced its first [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]] test last week. The current draft of the resolution would ban North Korea from importing any materials that could be used in the construction of nuclear weapons, it would also restrict international travel of those involved in the country's weapons program and their family members. The five permanent members of the council and [[Japan]] met on Friday morning to discuss the wording of the bill which should be put to a vote by the full fifteen members this afternoon.

The ban also covers the purchase of large scale {{w|conventional weaponry}} (such as tanks, ships, aircraft and missiles) but falls short of an outright ban on the import of military hardware. Imports of luxury goods will also be restricted. In the financial sector the resolution will also authorise the freezing of assets belonging to those suspected of involvement with North Korea's weapons program.
<!--[[Image:Hill christopher.jpg|thumb|left|Christopher Hill, US Assistant Secretary of State for Asia last night commented on N. Korean "threats."]]-->
The new resolution will come five days after North Korea announced its first nuclear weapons test on Monday. The test has come under international condemnation, for which North Korea has blamed the [[United States]]. State news channel KNCA said that the United States "hostile policy ... has gone beyond the tolerance limit and a dangerous atmosphere of confrontation, reminiscent of that on the eve of war, is now prevailing on the Korean Peninsula." In response a Christopher Hill, US {{w|Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs|Assistant Secretary of State}} for the area, called the comments "belligerent threats" and said that the US was not nervous of them.

A year ago North Korea walked out of 'six-party' talks (between both Koreas, the United States, [[China]], [[Russia]] and Japan) that were set up to rid {{w|Pyonyang}} of its nuclear program in return for economic incentives. The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Alexander Alexyev, said that North Korea was now willing to rejoin the talks, previously the country had left in protest over US financial sanctions.

Today's vote may be delayed by Russia and China who have requested last minute alterations to the bill. Although U.S. Ambassador [[John R. Bolton]] said last night that the changes were "technical" and that the vote would only be delayed by a few hours. The objections by the two countries appears to centre around the possible use of military personnel to enforce the resolution. China wish to ensure that the bill cannot be used (under {{w|Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter 7}} of the {{w|UN charter}}) as grounds or justification for military action against North Korea. They are also said to be worried about the wording of a section of the text that would allow nations to search any cargo to or from North Korea.

In the event of action against North Korea or for the countries economy to be hit China may suffer the most out of all of the nations on the council. They fear the influx of refugees into the country.

General Assembly elects Ban Ki-moon as next UN chief
{{date|October 14, 2006}}
[[Image:Bankimoon.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ban Ki-moon]]
South Korean [[Ban Ki-moon]], 68, has been endorsed unanimously by the {{w|UN General Assembly|general assembly}} to succeed [[Kofi Annan]] as the {{w|United Nations Secretary-General|secretary-general}} of the [[United Nations]], on October 13. 

He will take the position of Secretary General on January 1.

When asked by {{w|President of the United Nations General Assembly|assembly president}} {{w|Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa|Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa}} to adopt the resolution by an oral vote, the room filled with hundreds of diplomats and UN staff clapping loudly. A formal vote was not conducted as the decision was unanimous.

She banged her gavel after the vote and said, "It is so decided. I have the honor to announce that His Excellency Ban Ki-moon has been appointed by acclamation secretary-general of the United Nations. This is a historic day for the organization as it continues to evolve and live up to the values and principles of the {{w|United Nations Charter|&#91;UN&#93; Charter}}." 

At the time of the decision itself, the South Korean was the only candidate for the job - when informal polls were carried out within the UN, the other five individuals fared so badly that they all dropped out of the leadership race.

"I will work diligently to materialise our responsibility to protect the most vulnerable members of humanity and for the peaceful resolution of threats to international security and regional stability," Mr. Ban told the Assembly.

"The true measure of success for the UN is not how much we promise, but how much we deliver for those who need us most."

"The UN is needed now more than ever before."

Mr. Ban, the first Asian Secretary General since {{w|U Thant}} from [[Burma]], said he was committed to meeting {{w|United Nations Millennium Project|U.N. Millennium Development Goals}}, expanding peace operations and dealing with threats posed by terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, HIV/AIDS and other pandemics, environmental degradation and protecting human rights.

He also mentioned {{w|Reform of the United Nations|reform of the UN}}, something the [[United States]] — which contributes the largest part of the budget of the UN, with 22&nbsp;%&nbsp;, but also has arrears of 1.3 billion dollars — has long called for. However, the new Secretary General made clear that any changes would occur at his own pace.

"We reform not to please others, but because we value what this organisation stands for," he said. 

"We cannot change everything at once. But if we choose wisely, and work together transparently, flexibly and honestly, progress in a few areas will lead to progress in a few more." 

Kofi Annan, 68, described Ban as "a future secretary-general who is exceptionally attuned to the sensitivities of countries and constituencies in every continent. A man with a truly global mind at the helm of the world's only universal organisation."

He added that he wished Ban strength and courage as he prepared to take over the job and to "have fun along the way."

"We believe he is the right person to lead the United Nations at this decisive moment in its history, particularly as the UN struggles to fulfill the terms of the reform agenda that world leaders agreed to last fall," U.S. Ambassador [[John R. Bolton]] told the assembly.

Israeli Ambassador Danny Gillerman said that it was good for Israel's standing in the organization.

"If the secretary general is serious and fair and appoints underlings who are serious and fair, and the UN will be serious, clean and organized, this will be good for the Jews,"  said Mr. Gillerman.

Mr Ban will hold the position for five years until the next election in 2011.

North Korea returns to six-party talks
{{date|October 31, 2006}}
{{North Korea nuclear program}}
[[Image:Northkoreaflag.jpg|right|thumb|200px|North Korea conducted its first nuclear test three weeks ago]]
[[North Korea]] has today agreed to return to the {{w|six-party talks}} about its nuclear programme, as announced by the {{w|Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese}} and {{w|Federal government of the United States|U.S.}} governments. This comes after {{w|Politics of North Korea|Pyongyang}}'s withdrawal two weeks ago after the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] unanimously voted to impose sanctions on North Korea, which were ultimately designed to remove the ability to create nuclear weapons.

{{w|President of the United States|United States President}} [[George W. Bush]] has thanked the Chinese government for assisting and persuading North Korea to return to the talks. He went on to say that "<nowiki>[</nowiki>the US will<nowiki>]</nowiki> be sending teams to the region to work with our partners to make sure that the current {{w|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718|United Nations Security Council resolution}} is enforced but also make sure the talks are effective, that we achieve the result we want". Pyongyang did not make the lifting of the sanctions a condition for the resumption of the talks.

The negotiations between the six parties, North Korea, {{w|People's Republic of China|China}}, the {{w|United States|United States of America}}, {{w|South Korea}}, {{w|Russia}}, and {{w|Japan}}, could restart as early as November, said {{w|Christopher R. Hill}}, the chief US negotiator on North Korea. {{w|Politics of South Korea|South Korea}} was optimistic about the resumption of the talks. "The government hopes that the six-party talks will resume at an early date as agreed," said Choo Kyu-ho, spokesman for South Korea's foreign ministry.

Pranab and Oli discuss Nepal peace talks
{{date|November 6, 2006}}

The Indian External Affairs Minister [[w:Pranab Mukherjee|Pranab Mukherjee]] has talked with the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Nepal K P Sharma Oli to discuss the status of ongoing peace talks with the Maoist rebels.

Oli met Indian Prime Minister [[w:Manmohan Singh|Manmohan Singh]] and Pranab Mukherjee during his visit in [[w:New Delhi|New Delhi]].

He provided them an overview about the efforts being made by government to persuade the Maoists to quit the arms.

During an-hour long talk between Mukherjee and Oli, they reviewed the implementation of the economic package announced after Koirala's visit to India in June. They also discussed about the key infrastructure projects in Nepal, like, export of power from India to Nepal and construction of transmission lines.

The talk was important as Maoist and Nepal government are trying to resolve the issue.

Opposition to John Bolton's appointment to the UN grows
{{date|November 10, 2006}}
{{missing image|Image:John Bolton State Dept.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Ambassador John Bolton}}
The confirmation of [[John Bolton]] as the [[w:US Permanent Representative to the United Nations|US Permanent Representative to the United Nations]] is in doubt as Republican Senator [[w:Lincoln Chafee|Lincoln Chafee]] joins Democrats in opposing his nomination.

[[w:John Bolton|John Bolton]] was first nominated to the position by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] in March 2005, but his appointment was opposed at that time when the Democrats on the Senate appointments committee, along with Republican Senator [[w:George Voinovich|George Voinovich]]. He was then appointed by the President during congressional recess in August. This recess appointment must now be confirmed by the Senate.

Bolton's previous confirmation stalled after the Senate committee's demands for information about Bolton's activities while he was in the State Department were rejected by the administration. In addition, there were concerns about whether or not he had exaggerated reports about [[Syria|Syria's]] weaponry and doubts about the suitability of his temperament as an Ambassador for the United States. 

While the Senate is in recess, the President can make appointments which have to be ratified subsequently. President Bush appointed John Bolton as Permanent Representative to the UN on August 1, the first day of the recess, asserting that the post was too important to be left vacant at a time when the country was at war and there was a vital debate about the reform of the UN. 

Democratic Senator [[w:Edward Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] called the  appointment "an abuse of power". The appointment is due to be confirmed before January 2007 after which it lapses.

Dr. John Bolton, a prominent [[w:neoconservative|neoconservative]] and sometime aide to [[w:James Baker|James Baker]], has been highly critical of the [[w:UN|UN]] and its role in international affairs. His opinions were shared by other Republicans including Sen. [[w:Norm Coleman|Norm Coleman]] who is reported as saying that the UN was "mismanaged and possibly corrupt". He was nominated for a [[w:Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] in February this year by [[w:Per Ahjmark|Per Ahjmark]], former deputy prime minister  of [[w:Sweden|Sweden]]. 

President Bush is reported as saying that he wants Bolton's appointment confirmed before January when the Democrats take power. The present constitution of the Senate Committee is 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats and Republican Sen. George Voinovich had come to support Bolton's appointment. However, the move by Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee, on the grounds that, at the recent elections, the people had spoken out against US foreign policy, could result in a hung vote. That would result in John Bolton being removed from his position as US Ambassador to the UN.

[[Image:Mayotte-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|left|Mayotte is between Madagascar and the coast of Africa]]{{North Korea nuclear program}}
{{date|November 16, 2006}}

Officials on the {{w|Indian Ocean}} island of {{w|Mayotte}} said that a [[North Korea]]n vessel they searched today had no illegal cargo.

The UN passed Resolution 1718, imposing new sanctions on North Korea, in response to a {{w|nuclear weapon|nuclear weapon}} test in October.

Eritrea moves troops into UN buffer zone
{{date|October 17, 2006}}
{{Ethiopia infobox}}
On Monday, the [[United Nations]] accused [[Eritrea]] of moving some 1,500 soldiers and 14 tanks into a U.N. buffer zone, instituted six-years ago over a [[w:Eritrean-Ethiopian War|border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia]]. Eritrea claimed it has the right to move troops into its sovereign area. An Eritrean presidential advisor said the troops were working on development projects in the Temporary Security Zone. [[Ethiopia]] sees the action as a provocation.

A U.N. chief spokesman said that [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] "urges the government of Eritrea to withdraw its troops from the zone immediately, and to cooperate with the United Nations in restoring the cease-fire arrangements." The U.N. had reduced its troops and military observers from 3,300 to 2,300 in May, and threatened late September to further reduce this number if the two countries do not move forward in their border conflict.

In 1962 the Emperor [[w:Haile Sellassie|Haile Sellassie]] of Ethiopia annexed Eritrea, which lead to the [[w:Eritrean War of Independence|Eritrean War of Independence]], until Eritrea regained control in 1991. The current border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia started in 1998, and ended in 2000 with a peace deal that stated the countries were bound to the decision of an independent commission ruling on the border issue. Ethiopia rejected the decision and insisted on further talks. Eritrea responded by hindering the peacekeepers' movements.

Last Sunday the [[w:Sudan|Sudanese]] government signed a peace treaty with the united rebel groups at the [[w:Eastern Front (Sudan)|Sudanese Eastern Front]], at the border with Eritrea. The Eritrean government changed their position from previously being the main supporter of the rebels, to striving for a cease-fire.

Despite 6 warnings Israel bombed and killed 4 UN observers
{{date|July 26, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
__NOTOC__
An Israeli bombardment killed four United Nations Observers, despite multiple warnings by UN peacekeeper. The peacekeepers at the post said the area within a kilometer of the post was hit with precision munitions, including 17 bombs and 12 artillery shells, four of which directly hit the UN observation post. The fatal strike with a "precision-guided weapon" according to UN military personnel hit the post at about 7.20pm. The victims were Austrian, Canadian, Chinese and Finnish UN-observers.

The Irish foreign ministry said that Israel ignored repeated warnings from Lieutenant-Colonel John Molloy, a key UN liaising officer, that its bombs were falling close to United Nations observers in southern Lebanon. The warnings came allegedly before an Israeli bomb killed four of the U.N. observers. "On six separate occasions he [Lieutenant-Colonel John Molloy] was in contact with the Israelis to warn them that their bombardment was endangering the lives of UN staff in South Lebanon". "He warned: 'You have to address this problem or lives may be lost'," an Irish foreign affairs spokesman said. 

Suzanne Coogan, a spokeswoman for the Irish Defence Minister Willie O'Dea said Molloy "warned the Israelis that they were shelling in very close proximity to the post, and his warnings were very specific, explicit, detailed and stark." She concluded, "Obviously those warnings went unheeded."

Irish Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern said "Evidence that we have would suggest that this was either an incredible accident or else was in some way directly targeted".

In 1996 over 100 civilians were killed by the Israeli bombing of a UN compound in Lebanon in an incident known as the [[w:Qana shelling|Qana shelling]].

==The United Nations==

Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said "I am shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting by Israeli Defense Forces of a United Nations observer post in southern Lebanon that has killed two United Nations military observers, with two more feared dead." 

Kofi Annan also said "This coordinated artillery and aerial attack on a long established and clearly marked U.N. post at Khiyam occurred despite personal assurances given to me by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that U.N. positions would be spared Israeli fire."

According to an [[Wikipedia:UNIFIL|UNIFIL]] press release there were 14 prior incidents of firing close to this position by aerial bombs and artillery shells before the fatal hit occurred. Also, 9 UNIFIL bases were bombed earlier during this war but with no apparent casualties. It was also reported [[Hezbollah]] fired "from the vicinity" of United Nations positions in Alma ash Shab,  Tibnin, Brashit, At Tiri.

==Israeli representatives==

*'''Prime Minister'''
:Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, issued a statement. "It's inconceivable for the UN to define an error as an 'apparently deliberate' action."  He expressed his deep sorrow earlier on Wednesday over the deaths.

*'''Foreign Ministry spokesman'''
:"Israel sincerely regrets the tragic deaths of the UN personnel in south Lebanon," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev.

*'''Israeli Ambassadors'''
:Dan Ayalon, the Israeli Ambassador to the US, demanded that Annan apologize for the remarks, which he called "baseless."  The Israeli Ambassador to the UN, Dan Gillerman, expressed his "deep regret" for the deaths, and denied that the incident was intentional.  He said that he was "shocked and deeply distressed by the hasty statement of the Secretary-General, insinuating that Israel has deliberately targeted the UN post," calling the comments "premature and erroneous."

:Gillerman said "Israel is carrying out a thorough inquiry into this tragic incident and will inform the UN of its results as soon as possible."

*'''Israel Defense Forces (IDF)'''
:In a statement issued by the [[Wikipedia:Israel Defense Forces|Israel Defense Forces (IDF)]], "Following an initial inquiry, it appears that during the operation a UN post was unintentionally hit . . . The IDF is launching a full investigation in close coordination with the UN."

==China==

Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said "China urges the sides concerned, especially Israel, to take tangible measures to ensure the security of UN peacekeepers" .

Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Zhai Jun told Israeli Ambassador Yehoyada Haim "China strongly condemns the activity to raid the UN peacekeeping post and urges Israel to carry out a thorough investigation and apologize to China and the victim's families, and coordinate with China to deal with the aftermath".

The Chinese victim, named Du Zhaoyu, was a Lieutenant Colonel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He has been in Lebanon as a UN observer since January.

==Finland==

Finnish President Tarja Halonen wanted a full investigation of the attack and also said there was no justification for an attack on the U.N. post.

Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja said "It is not the first time that they (U.N. peace keepers) have been attacked, but it is the first time they have been killed." Mr Tuomioja continued  "These so called precision attacks seem to be hitting everyone except Hezbollah, there have been hundreds of civilians, international workers and others killed already and it does not seem that by these means a military solution could be achieved."

The Finnish victim was Lieutenant-Commander Jarno Mäkinen from Kaarina. He was 29 years old and joined United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in November 2005. Before that training officer and unit commander in the Uusimaa Brigade.

==Canada==

Prime Minister Stephen Harper says Israel's deadly attack on a UN observation post in Lebanon was a "terrible tragedy". He doubts that the bombing was deliberate. "I certainly doubt that to be the case, given that the government of Israel has been co-operating with us in our evacuation efforts" "We want to find out why this United Nations post was attacked and also why it remained manned during what is now, more or less, a war during obvious danger to these individuals."

Mr Harper said he was waiting for a call from Olmert. "I expect that he will be expressing his deep regret. But also I'll be asking for his full co-operation in getting to the bottom of this." He also said he would follow the results of the UN and Israeli investigation rather than launching his own.

The Canadian victim is Major Paeta Hess-von Kruedener, a member of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. He had completed nine months of his one-year assignment with the UN in Lebanon.

On July 18, Major Paeta Hess-von Kruedener provided CTV.ca with an update of his mission via e-mail.
He said that there had been numerous occasions when his post had come under fire. "What I can tell you is this: we have on a daily basis had numerous occasions where our position has come under direct or indirect fire from both artillery and aerial bombing,"  

"The closest artillery has landed within two meters of our position and the closest 1000 lb aerial bomb has landed 100 meters from our patrol base." Retired Canadian Major General Lewis Mackenzie was interviewed on CBC radio, and told of an e-mail letter from Kruedener. "He was telling us that Hezbollah soldiers were all over his position and the IDF were targeting them. Since Hezbollah don't have representation in the UN, they use the UN as shields knowing that they can't be punished for it."

==Austria==

A statement from Austria foreign ministry issued by foreign minister Ursula Plassnik said "Such an attack on unarmed UN observers is entirely unacceptable and can in no way be justified" Ursula Plassnik expressed Austria's indignation over the attack and demanded an immediate and thorough investigation into the incident.

Montenegro becomes 192nd UN Member State
{{date|June 28, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag of Montenegro.svg|200px|right]]
[[w:Montenegro|Republic of Montenegro]] became 192nd member state of the [[United Nations]], following a vote in the [[w:General Assembly of the United Nations|General Assembly]].

After the protocol officers had escorted the Montenegrin delegation to their seats in the Assembly, flag-raising ceremony took place in front of UN headquarters in [[w:New York City|New York City]]. Secretary-General [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] welcomed the newest member by praising non-violent and democratic process that gained Montenegro its independence from state union of [[w:Serbia and Montenegro|Serbia and Montenegro]], through an [[w:Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]], on May 22, 2006.

Montenegro is the latest country to be admitted to the UN, following the international recognition of [[w:East Timor|East Timor]] in 2002.

France offers promised 2000 soldiers to the UN in Lebanon
{{date|August 24, 2006}}
[[Image:FS Mistral 02.jpg|thumb|French ship ''[[w:French command ship Mistral|Mistral]]'' is already enroute, carrying 100 engineering vehicles for the [[w:UNIFIL|UNIFIL]].]]
[[Image:Leclerc p1040621.jpg|thumb|Deployment of [[w:Leclerc|Leclerc]] battle tanks has been evoked by the French press.]]
After a meeting with the government and general officers, [[w:French President|French President]] [[w:Jacques Chirac|Jacques Chirac]] announced today that the French complement in the [[w:UNIFIL|UNIFIL]] will be increased to 2,000. 

"Conditions required by France being fulfilled, I decided to favourably answer the requests of the General Secretary of the United Nations, and of the Lebanese and Israeli governments", Chirac declared; "two more battalions will come to reinforce our deployment on the field within the UNIFIL. 2,000 French soldiers will thus serve under the blue helmet in Lebanon".

Chirac also underlined that the deployment of the 1,700 strong [[w:Opération Baliste|Opération Baliste]] would continue.

UNIFIL is currently headed by French Major General [[w:Alain Pellegrini|Alain Pellegrini]].

France initially surprised the world by promising to send only 200 more soldiers, after playing a major diplomatic role in settling the cease-fire, and while a reinforcement of the UNIFIL to 15,000 troops had been announced by the United Nations. The press has commented that France is reluctant to send Blue Helmets without clear rules of engagements and guarantees, after the experience of the [[w:UNPROFOR|UNPROFOR]] in Bosnia, where French soldiers had been forced to witness atrocities without being able to intervene, had been taken hostages without means to defend themselves, and had suffered heavy casualties.

Countries expected to contribute the bulk of the troops to the "reinforced UNIFIL" are France, [[w:Italy|Italy]] and [[w:Spain|Spain]]; reinforcements are also expected from [[w:Belgium|Belgium]] and [[w:Greece|Greece]]. 

President Chirac said that he wanted a "fair repartition of contributions" and called for "other permanent members of the Security Council" to contribute; he mentioned that "Several European partners will do so, as well as important Muslim countries of Asia". Chirac cited [[w:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|United Nations Resolution 1701]] by requesting "the release of the abducted Israeli soldiers, the return of the Lebanese prisoners, the delineation of the borders, especially in the Shebaa Farms area". 

Lebanese Prime minister [[w:Fouad Siniora|Fouad Siniora]] declared that "the decision from President Chirac helps Lebanon, reinforced her stability, and helps her get back her territory through Israeli withdrawal, and instaur authority of the State in South Lebanon".

Violence in East Timor causes United Nations evacuation
{{date|May 29, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|left|thumb|180px|Flag of the United Nations]]
{{aussieissue|2006 East Timor crisis}}
An upsurge in violence in [[w:East Timor|East Timor]] has made the [[United Nations]] evacuate hundreds of staff members and families from the country. 

Sukehiro Hasegawa, the Special Representative to Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Dili said, "A temporary relocation for non-essential staff is the most judicious choice at this time."

The decision comes after the Australian-led peacekeeping operation and the East Timorese government struggled to contain unrest in [[w:Dili|Dili]], the country's capital. 

Gang members, some wielding machetes, have been fighting along ethnic lines. There also has been looting and buildings have been razed. 

Staff members and families will be relocated to Darwin, Australia. Over 100 United Nations staff will remain in East Timor awaiting the arrival of more Australian peacekeeping forces.

The peacekeeping operation began after an appeal by the government for international help. Australian forces are part of the multinational force that numbers over 2000 military personnel. 

The peacekeepers say they do not directly engage in combat. This brought confusion from one child who said, "Why aren't the Australians doing anything?" 

The Australian Prime Minister John Howard said, "It's a trickier operation than some people think, nobody should assume that it's just a simple walk-in-the-park military operation -- it's quite challenging."

UN appeals for more aid for devastated Pakistan region
{{date|October 20, 2005}}

===UN comments on alleged lack of aid===
[[Image:Kofi Annan.jpg|left|thumb|Kofi Annan, Secretary general of the United Nations]]
[[Kofi Annan]], [[w:Secretary General of the United Nations|Secretary General of the United Nations]], has sent out a plea for more aid for regions of Pakistan affected by this month's devastating [[w:2005 Kashmir earthquake|earthquake]]. He fears thousands could die if aid does not arrive soon.

The death toll from the earthquake is already feared to be at least 79,000. 

"...Unlike some natural disasters, in which victims die immediately, the death toll in Pakistan is not over yet," Annan says. "An estimated three million men, women and children are homeless.  Many of them have no blankets or tents to protect them against the merciless Himalayan winter. That means a second, massive wave of death will happen if we do not step up our efforts now.

Helicopters and trucks are of the greatest need.

"The money to pay for those things has been lacking", said Annan."So far, we have received firm commitments for only 12 per cent of our appeal. That is $37 million US out of the $312 million that we need."

During the massive relief effort for the Dec. 26 tsunami 80 percent of the appeal was filled in 10 days.

A major donor conference has been called for next week by Annan. He hopes it will help speed up aid.

"There are no excuses," Annan also said.  "If we are to show ourselves worthy of calling ourselves members of humankind, we must rise to this challenge."

===Officials suggest major evacuation===
Emergency relief co-ordinator Jan Egeland said today that NATO needs to organize a massive air-lift if it wants to save lives.
The evacuation needs to take place before winter sets in. The main taget would be small isolated villages.

NATO ''has'' been air-lifting in aid every day from it's base in Germany. Another "air brigade" was added recently from Turkey.

The major airlift is needed "to get supplies in and people out," Egeland told CBC News on Thursday.
In order to shelter everyone who is homeless they need, "350,000 tents, which is a mind-boggling number, more than we know exist in the world, are needed..." 
"We have emptied all of our warehouses."

===Difficult decisions being made on rescue front===
Feeling the need to prevent the feared second wave of death, rescuers are in the process of making hard decisions. Aid workers have decided that, this weekend, the focus will switch from treating 87,000 injured to getting aid to the homeless.

"It's a tough call but we have to face the fact that we're going to save more lives by getting tents, shelter, food, and supplies up to the people who have nothing [rather] than continuing to bring the injured down," said Capt. Edward Parsons, with the UN's Humanitarian Relief Operation in Pakistan

Helicopters are "double tasking" in their trips to small villages. They drop off supplies then pick up the injured.
However, the method is proving time-consuming, the need to speed up inward air-lifts is growing.

Activists remember Burundi's Gatumba massacre
{{date|August 13, 2005}}   
[[Image:LocationBurundi.png||right]]
Human rights groups around the world are marking the first anniversary of the [[w:Gatumba|Gatumba]] massacre, in which more than 150 Congolese "Banyamulenge" [[w:Tutsis|Tutsis]] were killed, at a refugee camp in western Burundi.    

"On this first anniversary of this unspeakable atrocity, we have the moral obligation to honour the memory of these people who were killed just because of their Tutsi ethnic origins", said Emmanuel Nkurunziza of the Burundian campaign group "Action Contre [[w:Genocide|Genocide]]".

"The search for those responsible for the massacre continues", said the UN's mission to Burundi (ONUB), in a statement. 

In the immediate aftermath of the Gatumba attack, the hardlined Hutu-extremist rebel group Palipehutu-FNL (FNL) claimed responsibility, saying that they had no fear of being held to account because they had become "untouchable". UN investigators suggest that Rwandan and Congolese milita groups may also have been involved in the attack. The FNL later claimed that the [[w:refugee|refugee]] camp was a military base. The UN has found no evidence for this claim, and human rights groups pointed out that nearly half of the dead were children.

2,000 people, including survivors and relatives of the dead, today attended a memorial service in Burundi, Reuters has reported. 

"What happened on August 13 was a genocide... One year after the massacre nothing has been done... We demand that justice be done", [[w:Banyamulenge|Banyamulenge]] spokesman Binagana Amon is quoted as saying. Amon also criticised the United Nations for its "silence" over the attack. 

The London-based "International Action Network on Small Arms" ([[w:IANSA|IANSA]]) today paid tribute to the 156 victims of Gatumba, who included a local member of the organisation, Pastor Jaques Rutekereza. 

"His deep faith gave him the courage to face his awful death, and the death of those he loved, with dignity and courage", IANSA said last year, in a statement honouring  Rutekereza. "The world has lost a great man. It has lost a man of peace."

Rutekereza died with six of his children, according to IANSA. 

Members of the [[w:Congolese|Congolese]] diaspora have been active in the commemorations. The community in Portland, Maine has organised a weekend of events, including public testimonies from those who lost loved ones in the attack, and a talk by John B. Robinson, who helped produce the film "[[w:Hotel Rwanda|Hotel Rwanda]]."

"We can't forget them", Georges Budagu told the Portland Press Herald. 

"We want to make sure the United Nations and the United States use their influence to bring those people... to justice". Three of Budagu's cousins died in the massacre. 

The UN, in turn, asked the Burundian authorities to do more to pursue the perpetrators:

"In the name of the victims, and as part of the effort to end impunity for the killings and massacres that have plagued this region for too many years, we urge the Government of [[w:Burundi|Burundi]] to complete its investigation, issue the report of its findings and bring those responsible to justice."

The UN also repeated its call for Burundi to involve the [[w:International Criminal Court|International Criminal Court]] in the investigation. Previous efforts had stalled due to opposition to the Court within the UN Security Council.

Following the FNL's admission of responsibility for Gatumba, the Burundian government produced international arrest warrants for the group's leaders Agathon Rwasa and Pasteur Habimana. Regional heads condemned the group as a terrorist organisation, with South African's President [[w:Thabo Mbeki|Thabo Mbeki]] likening the FNL's ideology to that of the [[w:Nazis|Nazis]]. Yet when Rwasa held a press conference in Tanzania in May, no attempt was made to arrest him. A ceasefire deal signed soon afterwards broke down within days. 

Burundi's refugee minister Francoise Ngendahayo today said that her government is committed to seeing justice for the victims of Gatumba. 

"Those responsible will be arrested but Burundi cannot do this work alone, we need the collaboration of the DR Congo and the UN", she told Reuters.

Burundi's President-elect recently suggested that the FNL could be allowed to join his government. Some analysts believe that offering the group an amnesty might help bring peace to Burundi. Others argue that this could make the situation worse.

"For reasons of diplomacy, people are sitting at the exact same table as war criminals, and in some cases granting them immunity. If the atrocities are to end there must be at least some indications that justice will be done", [[w:Human Rights Watch|Human Rights Watch]] spokesman Stephan Van Praet told Reuters, in the aftermath of Gatumba.

Action Contre Genocide's Emmanuel Nkurunziza today criticised the UN for what he called a "paradoxical" response to the massacre. Despite widespread international condemnation of the attack, the UN representative in Burundi Carolyn McAskie held face-to-face meetings with the FNL in [[w:Nairobi|Nairobi]] earlier this year.

"There was no repentance from these killers prior to the meeting; nonetheless, she went on to relay their so-called demands", he said.

Local media recently reported 300 civilian deaths at the hands of the FNL during June and July.  An estimated 300,000 people, mostly [[w:civilians|civilians]], have died in Burundi since civil war broke out in 1993.

USA rejects UN Guantanamo report
{{date|February 21, 2006}}

[[w:Scott McClellan|Scott McClellan]], White House spokesman, dismissed a [[United Nations]] report today dealing with the [[w:Guantánamo Bay|Guantánamo Bay]] facilities.  The UN report said that the [[United States]] government should "expeditiously bring all Guantánamo Bay detainees to trial" without further delay, and called upon the U.S. to close the Guantánamo Bay detention facility.

McClellan responded, "These are dangerous terrorists that we're talking about that are there and I think we've talked about that issue before and nothing's changed in terms of our views." McClellan added, "We know that these are dangerous terrorists that are being kept at Guantanamo Bay. They are people that are determined to harm innocent civilians or harm innocent Americans. They were enemy combatants picked up on the battlefield in the war on terrorism." 

Three months ago, the US Ambassador to the [[Czech Republic]], Jan Krc, asked that country to give [[wikt:asylum|asylum]] to a group of Guantanamo detainees which would have set them free in Europe. The U.S. request to the Czechs about asylum was "a humanitarian request because we clearly need to place these people somewhere," Krc said.

In a press encounter, [[Kofi Annan]] responded to a journalist, he didn't accept all the conclusions of the report but, "Sooner or later there will be a need to close Guantanamo, sooner or later". He said, "I cannot agree with everything in the report, but I did indicate that the basic premise, that we need to be careful to have a balance between effective action against terrorism and individual liberties and civil rights, I think is valid."

The United Nations report is based upon information from the United States Government, interviews conducted by the experts with former Guantanamo Bay detainees currently residing or detained in [[France]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]].  The U.S. government's invitation for UN investigators to visit the prison was turned down because the United States would not allow the UN investigation team to conduct interviews with detainees. The report follows an 18 month study by 5 experts in various areas of human rights.

Lebanon faces humanitarian crisis
{{date|July 23, 2006}}

More than half a million people have been displaced in [[w:Lebanon|Lebanon]] as the conflict between [[w:Israel|Israel]] and [[Hezbollah]] continues into its second week. The UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland, who visited Beirut said that a humanitarian crisis was unfolding in the country and outlined planned relief efforts. Efforts are underway to open a safe corridor to allow aid shipments to be sent to Lebanon. The evacuation of foreign nationals from Lebanon continues. Israel launched more air strikes and also a ground incursion into Lebanon, and Hezbollah launched rocket attacks on northern Israel.

==UN relief coordinator visits Beirut==
[[Image:Beirut 2006 bomb damaged buildings.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Buildings damaged by bombing in Beirut <br> Source: Haitham Moussawi/IRIN]]
[[w:Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator|UN relief coordinator]] [[w:Jan Egeland|Jan Egeland]] flew to [[w:Beirut|Beirut]] for a 48 hour visit to Lebanon focused on assistance required by people displaced or trapped by the conflict.

He visited Haret Hreik, a crowded Beirut neighborhood where Hezbollah had its headquarters, hours after it was bombed by Israel. Calling the destruction there "horrific", he said, "I did not know it was block after block of houses,... It makes it a violation of humanitarian law". Mr. Egeland appealed for both sides to put a halt to attacks.

The Israeli government said the military was trying to be as precise as possible in its operations in Lebanon. "The Lebanese people are not our enemy. We cannot sit idly by while Hezbollah terrorists launch rockets at our towns and cities," Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said.

Mr. Egeland said there was a humanitarian crisis unfolding in Lebanon, and more than half a million people were directly affected. He said that wounded people were unable to get treatment, no safe drinking water was available and that tens of thousands of civilians were caught in the crossfire between the Israeli Defense Forces and Hezbollah militants, particularly in south Lebanon. He expected the number of displaced to increase "dramatically" as Israel has warned the population of south Lebanon to leave the area ahead of possible new military action there.

Outlining plans for a "major" relief operation, he called for an end to violence to facilitate the aid effort, saying, "We can't get relief into the country in any quantity or distribute it beyond a few points".

{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
==Situation in Lebanon==
The Lebanese newspaper ''Daily Star'' reports that the number of displaced people in Lebanon passed 900,000 on Friday, with close to 40,000 refugees in Beirut itself. Other estimates place the number of refugees between half a million and a million. 

Israel has urged the remaining people living in south Lebanon to leave, and streams of people, some carrying white flags, are making their way from the south. 

About 42,000 refugees had flooded into the city of [[w:Sidon|Sidon]] from the surrounding countryside - believing it to be safe from attacks - when it was hit by Israeli strikes today.

In several towns and cities, food, medical supplies and fuel stocks are running low, and municipal authorities have expressed their inability to assist people. They have called for urgent shipments of food products such as milk, rice, sugar and canned meat; diapers and kitchen tools; medicine such as insulin, painkillers, antibiotics and chlorine to clean water; sterilized gloves; refrigerators to store medicine; tents; electrical generators of 5, 10, 20 and 30 kVA; blankets and other necessities.

In the government hospital in the Al-Bass Palestinian refugee camp, the mass burial of 86 bodies was begun, after rising casualties overwhelmed the local morgue. 

===Infrastructure hit===
The air strikes and bombardment of roads, bridges and trucks has made supplying aid to affected areas even more difficult. Lebanon's only international airport has been out of action since the first days of the conflict. Reports estimate that billions of dollars worth of infrastructure has been destroyed.

==UN plans relief operation==
The UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland spoke to reporters of the plans for getting aid to Lebanon. He said UN supplies of humanitarian aid would begin to arrive in the next few days. "But we need safe access," he said. "So far Israel is not giving us access." He estimated that US $100 million is urgently needed to help the half a million to one million people in Lebanon who were in need of international assistance. 

U.N. and other relief agencies have been asking for humanitarian aid corridors to be opened up. Israel said it opened a 50-mile-long and five-mile-wide (80-kilometre by eight-kilometre) safe passage to Beirut for ships and aircraft to allow aid into Lebanon.

Egeland said the United Nations was planning to deliver aid by setting up humanitarian corridors in the next few days. Aid will be shipped by road and by sea from Cyprus to Beirut and the southern city of Tyre, and by air. 

The evacuation of foreign nationals from Lebanon continues, with most being taken to the island of Cyprus, where temporary accommodation has to be found for the estimated 70,000 evacuees, in the middle of the holiday tourist season. 

The [[w:United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL) says that it plans to evacuate civilians from the Lebanese-Israeli border in the next few days, but "the ability to move will depend on the situation on the ground".

==Situation in Israel==
Meanwhile, thousands of Israelis have been living in bomb shelters since the fighting in Lebanon started and between a third to a half of all residents in northern Israel have left the area to escape the bombardment, officials said.
 
"For a week people have been sitting in shelters and security rooms, so they prefer to leave," said Adi Eldar, mayor of Carmiel in a report on ''Haaretz'' newspaper's Web site.

==Attacks continue==
On Saturday, more television stations and mobile telephone masts in Lebanon were targeted in Israeli strikes, killing five people, including a television station employee.

Israel struck Beirut, Sidon, a port city in the south crammed with refugees, for the first time and factories, roads and bridges in air strikes in the eastern [[w:Baalbek|Baalbek]] region, killing one person.

In [[w:Haifa|Haifa]], two people were killed by rockets fired by Hezbollah forces, and fifteen people are reported injured.

==Casualty figures rise==
Current estimates say that more than 350 Lebanese and at least 36 Israelis have been killed in the conflict. One third of those killed in Lebanon are children, according to a UN report released July 21.

UN Security Council considers Cote d'Ivoire sanctions
{{date|September  1, 2005}}

Yesterday, the [[United Nations Security Council]] said it would take all steps necessary, including the implementation of individual sanctions, in order to ensure that the resolutions of the Security Council were adhered to by both sides of the troubled Ivoiran peace process.  The remarks followed a briefing to the Security Council by representatives from the UN Mission in [[Ivory Coast|Cote d'Ivoire]] and African Union-appointed [[South Africa]]n mediators.

"The South African Mediation stated that it will continue its efforts, with the support of the [[United Nations]] and the African Union, to ensure the holding of free, fair and transparent elections in Côte d'Ivoire as scheduled, which is the only solution to the crisis," the Security Council said in a statement following the meeting.  

The next round of elections are scheduled for the end of October although it is widely believed this date is unlikely to be met.

The peace process in [[Ivory Coast|Cote d'Ivoire]] has been on shaky ground following the failure of the rebel forces to begin the disarmament process originally scheduled for 31 July.  The rebels, led by the Forces Nouvelles, claimed that Ivorian [[Laurent Gbagbo|President Gbagbo]] had failed to make the necessary legal reforms necessary to begin the disarmament.  The international community later ratified the legal changes made by the Ivorian government as being in compliance with the peace deal.

U.S. found in violation of Native Americans rights
{{date|March 13, 2006}}
[[Image:Yucca Mountain USGS.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[w:Yucca Mountain|Yucca Mountain]], a sacred mountains and burial ground planned to be US first long-term geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel]]
A [[w:UN|UN]] [[w:United Nations Commission on Human Rights|(UNCHR)]] committee on the [[w:Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD)]] found the [[w:Federal government of the United States|the US government]] in violation of [[w:Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans']] land rights and the international anti-racism convention.
The committee of 18 independent experts said in a press release that it had received credible information alleging that Western [[w:Shoshone|Shoshone]] peoples were being denied their traditional right to land. The decision details US actions against the [[w:Western Shoshone|Western Shoshone]] and calls upon the United States to immediately:

*  Respect and protect the human rights of the Western Shoshone peoples.
* Initiate a dialogue with the representatives of the Western Shoshone peoples in order to find a solution acceptable to them, and which complies with their rights.
* Adopt the following measures until a final decision or settlement is reached on the status, use and occupation of Western Shoshone ancestral lands in accordance with due process of law and US obligations under the Convention.
* Freeze all efforts to privatize Western Shoshone ancestral lands for transfer to multinational extractive industries and energy developers.
* Desist from all activities planned and/or conducted on Western Shoshone ancestral lands.
* Stop imposing grazing fees, livestock impoundments, and hunting, fishing and gathering restrictions; and rescind all notices already given.

[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.png|left|180px|thumb|[[w:United Nations|Flag of the United Nations]] ]]
Bernice Lalo, Western Shoshone delegate, said, "The mines are polluting our waters, destroying hot springs and exploding sacred mountains&mdash;our burials along with them&mdash;attempting to erase our signature on the land. We are coerced and threatened by mining and Federal agencies when we seek to continue spiritual prayers for traditional food or medicine on Shoshone land." Mr. Lalo continued, "We feel the decision will be helpful by opening the door. We will continue this struggle to give our children a better chance."

Joe Kennedy, a Western Shoshone, said, "We have rights to protect our homelands and stop the destruction of our land, water, and air by the abuses of the United States government and the multinational corporations. He said, "The situation is outrageous, and we're glad the United Nations Committee agrees with us."
[[Image:Oxfam Logo.gif|left|100px|Oxfam logo]]
Laura Inouye, [[w:Oxfam|Oxfam]] America, said, "This is a tremendous victory for the Shoshone people; the UN decision acknowledges the U.S. government's violations of Shoshone civil, political, economic, and cultural rights." Inouye concluded, "Hopefully, they will now be granted the justice that the US government has denied them for years." Oxfam America is a human rights organizaition which has backed the Western Shoshone.

A UN official said, according to the AP, that the US mission to the UN in Geneva had no immediate response to the decision.

The Western Shoshones' rights to the land, 60 million acres stretching across [[w:Nevada|Nevada]], [[w:Idaho|Idaho]], [[w:Utah|Utah]] and [[w:California|Califonia]], were recognized by the US under the [[w:Treaty of Ruby Valley 1863|1863 Treaty of Ruby Valley]], which was signed by [[w:Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant]] a few years later. 
It was questioned by [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|the US Supreme Court]], 1979; the land was labeled 'government trusteeship' and much was claimed as federal territory. [[w:George W. Bush|President Bush]] signed a bill in July 2004 that gave approval to distributing more than $145 million as compensation after the Shoshones voted to accept the distribution in a disputed election. 

Jim Manley, a spokesman for [[w:Harry Reid|Sen. Harry Reid]] (D. Nevada) and a proponent of the bill, said "The tribe twice has voted decisively in favor of the distribution."

U.S. calls for sanctions against Iran
{{date|August 30, 2006}}
{{Iran nuclear program}}
The [[w:United States|U.S.]] [[w:United States State Department|State Department]] has called for sanctions against [[w:Iran|Iran]] and has also said that Iran has not indicated to the [[United Nations]] that they intend to follow through with halting their [[w:Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]]. 

"We would expect that the parties would immediately begin formal discussions about a resolution that would call for sanctions," said spokesman for the State Dapartment, [[w:Sean McCormack|Sean McCormack]].

"[Sanctions] have been our intention for some months, it remains our intention, it'll be our intention on September the first if the Iranians don't comply with the resolution," said [[John R. Bolton]], the U.S. embassador to the United Nations.

Today, the ''Washington Post'' reported that the [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|International Atomic Energy Agency]] will report to the U.N. tomorrow that Iran is still enriching Uranium despite a U.N. resolution calling for the country to halt its nuclear program.

The [[w:China|Chinese]] Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing however, has called for a "diplomatic resolution" to Iran's nuclear program.

Iran's President, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] said that sanctions will not stop Iran from their "lofty goals of progress." He also said that [[w:Europe|Europe]] should "be independent [from the U.S.] in decision-making and to settle problems through negotiations" in regards to Iran's nuclear program.

The deadline set by the U.N. is set to expire on August 31.

Australian opposition minister gives speech on poverty
{{date|October 20, 2005}}

Australian shadow minister for work, family, youth, and community, [[w:Tanya Plibersek|Tanya Plibersek]], gave a speech today on poverty as part of Anti-Poverty Week 2005. During the speech she criticised the government in a number of areas, including not committing to the UN Millennium Development Goals, the proposed industrial relations legislation, and the governments funding of services for the homeless. 

Anti-Poverty Week runs from Monday 17th to Friday 21st October, and is derived from the United Nations International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on October 17th. Shaun Mortimer, the coordinator of Anti-Poverty Week at UNSW, said that the week was about "creating awareness and finding solutions to the plight of those living in poverty all around the world."

===UN foreign aid target===

Ms Plibersek said that Australia is not doing enough to help those in poverty overseas. She said that Australia currently gives 0.28% of its [[w:Gross National Income|Gross National Income]] in foreign aid, however this is far short of the United Nations target of 0.7%. 

"The Australian government is refusing to commit to the 0.7% target," she said. 

The UN development goal states that governments should reach the target by 2015. Labor has committed to meet the target, but the government has not. 

"Labor is committed to the 0.7% target. In the interim, the government should be spending 0.5% of GNI," Ms Plibersek said. 

===Millennium Development Goals===

Shadow Minister Plibersek accused the government of weakening Australias commitment to the [[w:Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals]]. The goals were agreed to in 2000 by all 191 member states of the United Nations. There are 8 goals, which signatory states have committed to work towards. The eight goals are:

#Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
#Achieve universal primary education
#Promote gender equality and empower women
#Reduce child mortality
#Improve maternal health
#Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
#Ensure environmental sustainability
#Develop a global partnership for development

Ms Plibersek said that Australia signed on to the goals, but is now not honouring that commitment, and is attempting to reduce the impact of the goals in an attempt to win the favour of the United States. 

"We signed on to the millennium goals," she said. 

"In it's rush to be popular with the US the government went along with watering down the millennium goals"

===Industrial Relations legislation===

Shadow Minister Plibersek strongly criticised the governments proposed industrial relations legislation. She argued that the proposed changes will disproportionately affect already vulnerable people such as single mothers, and push working people into poverty. 

"Industrial relations changes will see poverty worsen. It will increase the number of working poor," she said. 

Speaking about the governments hypthetical worker, "Billy", used in promotional material, Ms Plibersek said individual workplace agreements will result in lowered working conditions for all workers. She also claimed that if a working person is paid a wage that does not provide them with enough resources to live, they will need to depend on government services such as income support, and therefore taxpayers will be subsidising the low wages. 

"If Billy can not earn enough to live, then taxpayers are effectively subsidising business," she said. 

"If the system has no minimum standards it will drag everyone down. Unions have fought against this for over a century"

===Poverty in Australia===

Ms Plibersek spoke about the problem of poverty in Australia. She said that 2.4 million people in Australia are living below the poverty line, and 1 million of them have jobs. She also argued that wealth inequality is getting worse. 

"We have a nation now more divided than ever. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer," she said. 

Ms Plibersek felt that this situation was unnaceptable, and that the solution was only a matter of will. 

"I don't think we have to accept that people will always be poor. It is a situation we allow," she said. 

She also criticised the government for inadequately funding services for the homeless, and said that many homeless people who wanted help were unable to find any. Ms Plibersek argued that women escaping domestic violence were especially affected by this situation. 

"We turn away 1 in 2 people who approach homeless services for help," she said. 

Ms Plibersek also condemned what the government describes as the "skills shortage", saying that there are lots of Australians willing to gain skills, but are unable to get places in training institutions. 

"We turn 20,000 people away from TAFE and University each year," she said.

Australian PM faces inquiry into Iraqi kickbacks
{{date|April 14, 2006}}

{{Australian news}}{{aussieissue|Cole Inquiry}}[[Image:JHoward official.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Official photograph of Mr Howard]][[w:Australia|Australian]] [[w:Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], [[w:John Howard|John Howard]] appeared before the [[w:Cole inquiry|Cole inquiry]] on Thursday, the first time an Australian Prime Minister has appeared before an inquiry with royal commission powers since 1983.

Unlike his foreign minister [[w:Alexander Downer|Alexander Downer]] who gave evidence before the inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Howard entered through the front door where he gave a brief address. He told the press that his government is being open about the Iraqi kickback affair. " just want to make one point and that is that the appearance by me, earlier this week by the Foreign Minister and also by the Trade Minister, demonstrates absolutely how open and transparent and accountable the Government is being in relation to this matter" Mr Howard said to reporters.

Mr Howard was questioned by John Agius, counsel assisting the inquiry. Counsel for [[w:Australian Wheat Board|AWB]], the company at the centre of the scandal did not apply to cross-examine the prime minister.

Terrence Cole, the inquiry's commissioner received an application from Peter Geary and Micheal Long's counsel to cross-examine the prime minister but refused it on the grounds that the proposed line of questioning was similar to that of Mr Aguis' and that there was no evidence that Mr Howard had "ever met with Mr Geary or Mr Long".

Mr Agius questioned the prime minister about a series of diplomatic cables sent to his office, which raised concerns about AWB's contracts in Iraq.

Mr Howard told the inquiry that he doesn't recall reading or being briefed about any of the cables referred to by the inquiry. The inquiry also heard that prior to 2003 there was no system in place to identify which cables had been bought to the prime minister's attention.

In his statement to the inquiry, Mr Howard said that his office had not received four of the cables mentioned by the inquiry. Under questioning, Mr Howard confirmed this but conceded that it was likely that his staff had read the other 17.

When asked whether there were any guidelines which guided his advisors in deciding which cables should be bought to the prime minister's attention, Mr Howard replied "No, there weren't".

The inquiry heard that the only discussions about which cables which should be bought to Mr Howard's attention occurred when an advisor changed in very generic terms. Mr Howard told the inquiry that he would tell a new advisor "Well, you've got to exercise your own judgment, I can't possibly read everything, and clearly I want things brought to my attention which are, in your judgment, important and are relevant to issues in front of the government at the time".

Mr Howard admitted that the government had an interest in Iraq using the [[United Nations]] oil for food program for its own financial benefit, but said he did not expect cables dealing with alleged breach of UN sanctions to have been bought to his attention.

The questioning then turned to a statement Mr Howard made to the National Press Club on March 13, 2003, one week prior to the US-led Iraqi occupation. Speaking about [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]] Mr Howard said "He has cruelly and cynically manipulated the United Nations oil-for-food programme. He's rorted it to buy weapons to support
his designs at the expense of the wellbeing of his people".

Mr Agius asked Mr Howard if his statement was based upon briefngs he had received. Mr Howard told the inquiry that the information was based upon "open source" intelligence stated at addresses by [[w:Britain|British]] foreign secretary [[w:Jack Straw|Jack Straw]] and the [[w:United States|United States]] state department. Mr Howard said one of his advisors "checked with some cables to confirm that those cables supported the open-source claims and was satisfied that they did".

Mr Howard denied seeing the cables used by the advisor to support the claims, but believed he would have told her to be sure that everything they were saying can be supported by fact. Mr Howard told the inquiry that he never knew about cables which referred to Hussein rorting the UN Oil for Food program. Mr Howard admitted that at the time his "general knowledge" was that Hussein had breached UN sanctions and was rorting the Oil for Food program.

"My general knowledge at the time and belief was that the program had been rorted, and it was not seriously in dispute. Nobody was arguing it hadn't been rorted" Mr Howard said.

The prime minister was questioned about an unassessed intelligence report which mentioned a Jordanian trucking company known as "Alia" paying kickbacks to Hussein. In response to this Mr Howard told the inquiry that he could not recall the information being bought to his attention, which was not unusual.

Security Council sets deadline over Iran nuclear program
{{date|July 31, 2006}}

The [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] passed a resolution today demanding [[Iran]] halt all "enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development" before August 31. The resolution was passed under Article 40, Chapter VII of the {{w|United Nations Charter|UN Charter}}, which sets the stage for possible economic sanctions if Iran does not comply with the resolution, but does not authorise military action. Iran's envoy to the UN has rejected the move.

The resolution, number 1696, was drafted by the permanent five members of the council and was passed by a 14-1 vote, with [[Qatar]], the only Arab member of the council voting against.

The resolution expressed "serious concern" at [[Iran]]'s non-compliance with the {{w|IAEA}}'s demand to halt enrichment and other activities and asked the IAEA director to report on Iran's compliance by the end of August. This is the first legally binding demand on Iran to halt enrichment work, and the first to suggest possible sanctions. The resolution says that "appropriate measures" will be taken if Iran does not comply, but does not explicitly state any threat of sancions. 

Iran's ambassador to the UN, Javad Zarif told the Reuters news agency, "Iran's peaceful nuclear programme poses no threat to international peace and security and therefore dealing with this issue in the Security Council is unwarranted and void of any legal basis or practical utility,"

Valery Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN said the deadline was meant to meet Iran's request to allow it to consider an offer made in June by the permanent five and Germany, offering Iran a "package" of sops in return for giving up enrichment activities.

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld visits Brazil
[[Image:LocationBrazil.png|250px|left]]
<!--[[Image:Rumsfeld3 Brazil March23.jpg|right|200px|thumb|US Secretary Donald Rumsfeld during meeting with Brazilian Vice-President José Alencar. Photo:Marcello Casal Jr/ABr]]-->
{{dateline|date=March 26, 2005|location=[[w:Brazil|Brazil]]}}
Tuesday (March 22) the [[w:United States Secretary of Defense|United States Secretary of Defense]]  [[w:Donald Rumsfeld|Donald Rumsfeld]]   arrived   in Brazil for a visit with Brazilian President [[w:Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva|Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]], Vice-President and Defense Minister José Alencar,  and other top officials.

In a meeting with President Lula DaSilva and his Vice-President and Minister of Defense, José Alencar, Mr Rumsfeld discussed Brazil leading the UN military forces in Haiti, terrorism and narcotrafficking.

Rumsfeld told to AFP journalists:
"The United States has put forward four topics, which we have agreed to take up: application of a law to down [drug traffickers' aircraft]; [UN] operations in Haiti; drug trafficking; and the fight against terrorism, including Brazil's position on security in South America." 

==Joint Press Conference ==
Rumsfeld and Alencar held a Joint Press Conference in [[w:Brasilia|Brasilia]], the capital city of Brazil.
<!--[[Image:Rumsfeld4BrazilMarch23.jpg|right|220px|thumb|US Secretary Donald Rumsfeld  and Brazilian Vice-President José Alencar during Joint Press Conference in Brasilia, Brazil. Photo:Marcello Casal Jr/ABr]]-->
Rumsfled stated that the friendship between Brazil and United States is long-standing and highly-valued. He added that the US and Brazil were allies in the Second World War and partners in helping to shape key post-war institutions including the United Nations.

Journalists asked both José Alencar, and Mr Rumsfeld if they were concerned about Venezuelan President [[w:Hugo Chávez|Hugo Chávez]], particularly after his recent purchase of 100,000 AK-47 assault rifles.

Rumsfeld said:
:''Certainly I'm concerned. If one thinks about it, the discussion that's taking place,  as I understand it, is concerning something in the neighborhood of 100,000 AK-47s to be moved from Russia possibly to Venezuela.  I don't   know if it's firm, but I've read about it and heard it discussed.  Not just in the press, but bilaterally.  I can't imagine what's going to happen to 100,000 AK-47s.  I can't imagine why Venezuela needs 100, 000 AK-47s.  I just hope that, personally hope, that it doesn't happen.  I can't imagine that if it did happen, that it would be good for the hemisphere.''

The Brazilian Vice-President said that Brazil prefers not to interfere in the affairs of others: 
:''Brazil has always defended and will continue defending the self-determination of the different peoples and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries. Obviously, here in Brazil, which is a country historically pacific (peaceful), obviously we would like to increasingly deepen our diplomatic and trade relations with our countries, with the objective of achieving the common good.''

President Lula is scheduled to meet President Hugo Chávez, the President of Colombia Alvaro Uribe Velez and Spain's prime minister, José Luiz Zapatero next Tuesday in Ciudad Guayana, Venezuela.

The Workers' Party Secretary for International Foreign Relations didn't agree with the US Defense Secretary regarding [[w:Venezuela|Venezuela]].  He said that his  "declaration,  does not contribute to a process of stabilization of the  United States' relations with Latin America. It is  a kind of  mentality that, unhappyly, still is present in the American state, which  considers Latin America as an extension of its territory." [http://www.pt.org.br/site/noticias/noticias_int.asp?cod=33460] 

Rumsfeld praised Brazil's leadership in [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] operations in [[w:Haiti|Haiti]] where they have maintained order in the country after the overthrow of former President [[w:Jean Bertrand Aristide|Jean Bertrand Aristide]] in February 2004.

A reporter asked Mr Rumsfeld whether Brazil is ready to have a seat on the [[w:UN Security Council|UN Security Council]]. He answered by saying the Department of Defense doesn't have a voice or a role in that and the matter should be answered by the US President and the Secretary of State.

==FARC and SIVAM==
Journalists asked the Brazilian Vice-President José Alencar three if Brazil will declare the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as a terrorist organization and if the government is worried about the FARC infiltration in Brazilian territory. Alencar was evasive and he refused to answer the questions directly. 

Alencar said  Brazil repudiates narcotrafficking and that "if the organization adopts crime as an instrument for raising resources, obviously it is something that must be combated."  

Later he became impatient and said that he had already said everything he had to say. [http://www.embaixada-americana.org.br/?action=materia&id=3311&itemmenu= ], [http://www.mre.gov.br/portugues/noticiario/nacional/selecao_detalhe.asp?ID_RESENHA=119413] 

Mr Rumsfeld visited SIVAM, the Amazon Surveillance System. SIVAM, which was built by U.S. Defense contractor Raytheon Corporation, is an arrangement of interconnected sensors and radars  to supervise  both  environmental conditions and criminal activity in the [[w:Amazon|Amazon]],  

According to the [[w:Communist Party of Brazil|Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB)]],  about 60 activists protested in the Amazon against the visit of Rumsfeld when he was touring SIVAM.

Renato Rabelo, the President of the PCdoB released a note repudiating the visit of the US Secretary. "The Communist Party of Brazil repudiates the presence in domestic territory of the secretary of the Defense of the United States, Donald Rumsfeld. The undesired visitor  is one of the main expoents of the tyrant and imperialist  government of the United States", says a excerpt.[http://www.vermelho.org.br/diario/2005/0323/0323_rumsfeld1.asp]

Nigeria bill has Taylor implications
{{date|September  1, 2005}}

The [[Nigeria]]n legislature is considering a Bill that would permit the Senate to extradite persons granted asylum by Nigeria to other nations and organizations, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[African Union]], to face trial for [[war crimes]].  Under the law, the Senate would have the power to accept or decline applications for asylum as well as remit persons already with asylum to requesting organizations or countries.

If the Bill passes, it would provide the mechanism needed by Nigeria to lawfully extradite indicted war criminal [[Charles Taylor]] to stand trial at the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone|Special Court]] in [[Sierra Leone]].  To date, Nigeria has resisted repeated claims by Sierra Leone, the [[United States]], and the United Nations to extradite Mr. Taylor saying that they will only do so if called upon by a freely elected [[Liberia]]n government.  Liberia has its first national elections since Taylor's regime scheduled for October.

The Bill has significant implications in Liberia, where Taylor was President until ousted by the international community in August 2003, under an asylum deal with Nigeria.  The United Nations has maintained a peacekeeping mission in the country ever since.  In October, Liberia faces its first national elections since Taylor, and his influence, although against the terms of his asylum, is seen as potentially destabilizing.

The front runners in Liberia's presidential race recently spoke on the Taylor issue at a series of presidential debates held on local radio.  Although most candidates agree that the rule of law must be followed none would commit to handing Taylor over to the Special Court if elected.

Iranian president calls Israel ‘disgraceful blot’
{{date|October 27, 2005}}
[[Iran]]ians plan a nation-wide demonstration on Friday in support of their president's comments that called for the elimination of Israel. The demonstrations would coincide with the annual event called [[w:al-Quds Day|al-Quds Day]], where the Israeli control of Jerusalem is protested. 

[[w:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in a speech to 3,000 students in [[w:Tehran|Tehran]] said Wednesday there was, "no doubt the new wave [of attacks] in Palestine will soon wipe off this disgraceful blot from the face of the Islamic world." At a conference called ''"The World without Zionism"'', the recently elected Iranian president Ahmadinejad said the establishment of Israel was, "a move by the world oppressor against the Islamic world," a reference to Western military and political pressure.

Ahmadinejad won the presidency in June with a populist approach that stressed [[w:Islam|Islam]] and revolutionary principles. The speech cited numerous references to the [[w: Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] and included a declaration that, "As the imam said, Israel must be wiped off the map." 

Other similar remarks, such as "God willing, the eradication of Israel would soon be realized through the continued wisdom of the Palestinian nation," have drawn wide condemnation.

France and Germany have summoned the respective Iranian ambassadors to their countries. A spokesperson for the British government called the remarks "deeply disturbing and sickening". The European Union said in a joint statement that "calls for violence, and for the destruction of any state, are manifestly inconsistent with any claim to be a mature and responsible member of the international community".

Israeli Prime minister [[w:Ariel Sharon|Ariel Sharon]] said that "a country that calls for the destruction of another people cannot be a member of the United Nations" and added: "Such a country that has nuclear weapons is a danger, not only to Israel and the Middle East, but also to Europe."

The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] Secretary General [[w: Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] expressed "dismay" over Ahmadinejad's remarks. In statements released by his secretary on Thursday, Annan, whose plans still include a visit to Iran within a month, said he would "place the Middle East peace process, and the right of all states in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force, at the top of his agenda for that visit." The U.N. Charter calls on all members to refrain from threats or force against the territorial integrity or political independence of another state.

A U.S. state department spokesman, Sean McCormick, said the United States would not support the call by Israel to eject Iran from the United Nations. McCormick's response was centered on issues of the enriched uranium processing in Iran, the human rights of its people, and alleged support for terrorism abroad.

The U.S. has had no formal diplomatic relations with Iran since the [[w:Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]] of 1979.

Malawi appeals for further humanitarian aid
{{date|October 15, 2005}}
[[Image:Africa terrain.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Africa]]
[[w:Bingu wa Mutharika|Bingu wa Mutharika]], president of [[w:Malawi|Malawi]], has declared the massive food shortages in his country a national disaster. The declaration comes on the heels of mounting criticism from his opposition as well as church groups in Malawi that have urged him to do more to highlight the problem. Mutharika has also been criticised for denying reports of casualties from hunger-related illnesses. The [[United Nations]] World Food Program has welcomed the declaration, stating that he is finally acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The UN estimates that five million people will be in need of aid in the coming year.
[[Image:LocationMalawi.png|left|thumb|240px|Map highlighting Malawi]]
The president has noted that all 28 districts of his country are affected and that, in addition to the 300,000 tons of food being imported from [[w:South Africa|South Africa]], another 144,000 will be needed.

"We are facing a national disaster affecting the lives of our people," he said.

The food shortages have been blamed on one of the worst harvests Malawi has experienced in over a decade as well as the growing [[w:HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] crisis. Because Malawi is a [[w:landlocked|landlocked]] country whose economy is almost entirely dependent on agriculture, poor harvests can have drastic impacts on the population. Most of the country feeds themselves through subsistence farming. Additionally, during the mid-eighties and nineties Malawi took in over a million refugees from [[w:Mozambique|Mozambique]], which placed a significant strain on the economy but also opened it to foreign aid.

The United Nations has attempted to restructure Malawi's economy through programs from the [[w:World Bank|World Bank]] and the [[w:International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]]. 

Relief agencies have been scrambling to deal with the crisis. [[w:UNICEF|UNICEF]] Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Per Engebak has said, "The numbers of malnourished children are many times higher than the normal emergency threshold." 

It is predicted that the disaster will be worse than the humanitarian crisis that plagued the country three years ago. Admissions to Nutrition Rehabilitation Units, run by a coalition of aid agencies as well as the Ministry of Health, have risen by 25 percent.

Church groups in the country have been assisting in the emergency.  The Council of Churches in Malawi, which brings together 22 denominations, has been applying pressure to the government. In addition to the food crisis, Rev Matiya Nkhoma has highlighted the problems of political instability in the country.

The food crisis is not just a danger to Malawi. The UN estimates that 12 million people are in need of aid in Southern Africa.

IAEA Iran report leaked
{{date|April 29, 2006}}

The Director-General of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], has issued a new report titled "Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]" and distributed it to members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the Agency's member states, but notes that the report is to remain secret, stating that "unless the IAEA Board of Governors and Security Council decide otherwise, the Agency cannot authorise its release to the public."

Iran is presently neither a member of the UN Security Council nor of the IAEA Board of Governors. 

As of 20:52, 29 April 2006 (UTC) or earlier, the report was [http://www.payvand.com/news/06/apr/1242.html made available on the Internet] on the website ''payvand.com'', dated April 28, 2006. It is unknown whether or not the release was authorised by the United Nations Security Council or the IAEA.

The report's concluding paragraphs summarise the IAEA's findings: "33. All the nuclear material declared by Iran to the Agency is accounted for. Apart from the small quantities previously reported to the Board, the Agency has found no other undeclared nuclear material in Iran. However, gaps remain in the Agency's knowledge with respect to the scope and content of Iran's centrifuge programme. Because of this, and other gaps in the Agency's knowledge, including the role of the military in Iran's nuclear programme, the Agency is unable to make progress in its efforts to provide assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. ... 37. The Agency will pursue its investigation of all remaining outstanding issues relevant to Iran's nuclear activities, and the Director General will continue to report as appropriate."
