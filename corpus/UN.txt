Kyoto Treaty becomes legally binding on February 16
''November 18 2004, Nairobi.'' The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] has announced that the [[w:Kyoto Treaty|Kyoto Treaty]], which its signatories claim will counter the [[w:greenhouse effect|greenhouse effect]] and global climate changes, will take effect on February 16, 2005. 

The treaty could not be made legally binding to those countries who signed it earlier, the BBC reports, because they did not make up for the required 55% of the world's emission of greenhouse gases. Last month, [[w:Russia|Russia]] announced they would sign the treaty, pushing that percentage to 55%. Andrei Denisov, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, handed [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] the official papers today.

Several industrialized nations around the world have refused to ratify the Kyoto Treaty, in particular the [[w:United States of America|United States of America]] and [[w:Australia|Australia]]. The governments of both countries argue that signing the protocol would cause an estimated 3% decline in GDP, and thus stagnation of their economies, while resulting in only small total greenhouse gas reductions worldwide. The also point out that other major nations, notably China, are extempt from the treaty provisions.

Dem. Republic of Congo prepares to confront Rwanda
'''December 3, 2004'''

The [[w:Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]] may be preparing to have its troops face those of [[w:Rwanda|Rwanda]], which have allegedly been sighted by United Nations personnel on the Congo side of the border. 

The United Nations is attempting to mediate the conflict but both sides of the conflict appear to be pursuing independent policies, with Congo's president accusing Rwanda of being predatory, and Rwandan president refusing to back down from the threat of pursuing Rwandan rebels across Congo's territory.

Aid pledges rise; Japan promises 500,000,000 USD
{{date|January 1, 2005}}

In an abrupt about-face, the world's wealthiest nations have begun pouring funding into the Earthquake/Tsunami damaged region. Promised funds have doubled in the past 24 hours, to nearly 2 Billion [[w:United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] (USD).

== [[w:Japan|Japan]] tops the [[w:United States|U.S.]] ==

After the U.S. increased it's funding donation to 350 million USD, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi announced a half-billion dollar donation on Saturday, Jan. 1. [[w:People's Republic of China|China]] has promised 60.5 million USD, after Japan and the U.S., the [[w:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and
[[w:Sweden|Sweden]] for largest single-nation donation.
[[w:Norway|Norway]] increased it's funding donation to 180 million USD

== [[w:United Nations|U.N.]] warns of delays ==

Despite the encouraging promises, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Indonesia chief, Michael Elmquist, warned that logistics of securing the funds, purchasing supplies and shipping them to stricken regions will take time, possibly weeks. In the meantime, the confirmed death toll will continue to climb, as may deaths due to dehydration, disease, and starvation.

UN 'optimistic' on tsunami aid effort
{{date|January 3, 2005}}

The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] (UN) emergency relief coordinator [[w:Jan Egeland|Jan Egeland]] has said that he is increasingly optimistic about the relief efforts under way in tsunami-stricken countries. However, he cautions that there are still major problems getting aid to the [[w:Indonesia|Indonesia]]n province of Aceh. The [[w:BBC|BBC's]] Rachel Harvey, stationed in provincial capital Banda Aceh, reports that the area has been completely cut off for a week. He also said that logistical bottle necks that hampered speedy delivery of aid were improving, with new coordination centers set up in Aceh, near the epicenter of the earthquake, and [[w:Jakarta|Jakarta]]. Regional officials warn that despite improvements, some places may not receive aid for up to two weeks.

United States helicopters, based on a US aircraft carrier stationed off the coast of western Aceh, have begun dropping food and supplies into isolated parts of Aceh province. About 12 [[w:SH-60 Seahawk|Seahawk]] helicopters are involved in the operation. "We are relying on the helicopter system because that is the only way we can reach the most remote areas," said Michael Elmquist, head of the UN disaster relief operation in Indonesia. According to the World Food Programme, some helicopters are unable to touch down because mobs of people run towards them for help. Supplies are often thrown out of the helicopters to the crowd below.

UN proposes world-wide natural disaster warning system
{{date|January 20, 2005}} 

The [[w:United Nations|UN]] has proposed the formation of the International Early Warning Programme (IEWP), with the suggestion that it would have greatly limited the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean [[w:earthquake|earthquake]] and [[w:tsunami|tsunamis]].

The system would analyse data from all over the world and rapidly transmit warnings. It would also feature a population training element, to make sure people know what to do upon hearing warnings or to teach them to recognize danger signs.

“This new programme will help bring safety, security and peace of mind,” stated the Director of the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), Sálvano Briceno, at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) in Kobe, Japan.

The system, first proposed two years ago, has been given new impetus by the recent disaster in the Indian Ocean. It will warn against many types of natural disaster including wildfires, floods, droughts, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis.

The Program will see many existing UN programs working together, including the World Food Program, the World Meteological Program, the [[w:UNESCO|UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), and the [[w:UNEP|UN Environment Programme]] (UNEP). One third of the people the World Food Program helps are the victims of natural disasters.

The system will be built around better, more open flow of regional data and the formulation of local warning plans.

Kofi Annan notes high turnout in 2005 Iraq elections
[[Image:Iraq-election2005-V.jpg|thumb|An Iraqi citizen, turning his head to protect his identity, proudly displays the indelible ink on his finger as proof he has voted in Iraq's first free election.]]
{{Byline|date=January 31, 2005|location=[[w:New York|New York]], [[w:USA|USA]]}}
[[w:United Nations|UN]] Secretary General [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] has noted that the Iraqi people turned out in large numbers to vote in the January 30 ballot. Voters were deciding who to elect to the 275 seat Transitional National Assembly.

Sporadic violence saw the deaths of 22 people across the country during voting, but attacks by insurgents did not seem to deter voters from exercising their new democratic rights. Annan praised the courage of the people and congratulated the Independent Election Commission of Iraq (IECI) and UN officials for successfully running the poll.

The Secretary General went on to say that the success bodes well for the on-going transition process. The next step will be a referendum in October 2005 on the constitution the Transitional National Assembly will be tasked with drawing up.

In the Out-of-Country Voting Program, 93.6% of Iraqis eligible to vote, did so.

Human rights group critical of US opposition to ICC in Darfur
{{date|February 1, 2005}}

US based {{w|Non-governmental organization|NGO}} {{w|Human Rights Watch}} has criticised the [[United States of America|United States]] attempts to block the [[UN]] {{w|UN Security Council|Security Council}} from referring atrocities in the {{w|Darfur conflict}} region to the {{w|International Criminal Court}} (ICC). The US favours setting up an ad hoc tribunal instead. HRW claims that the resulting delay will lead to the loss of more innocent lives. 

The US has long opposed the ICC, because of concerns over politically motivated prosecutions of it's citizens.  

A report prepared by a five member UN commission noted "killing of civilians, enforced disappearances, destruction of villages, rape and other forms of sexual violence, pillaging and forced displacement, throughout Darfur", and secretly named alleged war criminals that should go before the ICC. 

{{w|Pierre-Richard Prosper}}, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes, said "We don't want to be party to legitimizing the ICC."  

In the last two years in the {{w|Darfur}} region more than 70,000 people have been killed, and over 2 million displaced.

== US opposition to ICC ==
The United States, which signed but did not ratify the statute during the {{w|Bill Clinton}} administration, withdrew its support soon after {{w|George W. Bush}} assumed the presidency. It signed the ICC Statute at the last minute, primarily so that it could continue to take part in negotiations on the rules of procedure for the new court, in an attempt to obtain an exemption for U.S. nationals taking part in UN-sponsored peacekeeping missions--as several other countries were able to do. The U.S. fears that American soldiers and political leaders may be subject to frivolous or politically motivated prosecutions.

U.S. opponents of the ICC maintain that in cases where the U.S. failed to act quickly enough to prevent disaster the U.S. has been criticized for allowing genocide to occur (e.g. {{w|Rwanda}}:[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2000/07/09/stories/0109000c.htm ''"Rwanda: U.S., France blamed for genocide"''],[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0406-08.htm  ''"Rwanda-US: Intelligence Warned Early of Genocide, New Papers Show"'']); in cases where the U.S. ''has'' acted quickly  they have been criticized and even accused of war crimes (e.g. Yugoslavia, {{w|Somalia}}:[http://agitprop.org.au/stopnato/20000323robyuguard.php  ''"Yugoslavia: US Terrorism"''], [http://www.boycottusa.org/usa_crimes_somalia.htm   ''"American Slaughter of People in Somalia"'']).

Furthermore, opponents contend that the neither the ICC nor the [[United Nations]] has any real power to enforce the extradition of war criminals from signatory states. Therefore, any kind of military action to force compliance would have to be undertaken (in large part) by the U.S., action which would expose U.S. officials to spurious charges of war crimes.

UN says no genocide in Darfur
{{byline|date=February 6, 2005 |location=NEW YORK,United States }} 

A report released by the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] last week said that there is no [[w:genocide|genocide]] in [[w:Sudan|Sudan's]] western region of [[w:Darfur|Darfur]]. 

The report also says that the Sudanese government and its Arab militias had committed crimes against humanity by destroying villages and torturing, killing and raping civilians. According to the report, there is credible evidence that local rebel groups, including the [[w:Sudanese Liberation Army|Sudanese Liberation Army]], are responsible for serious violations of international law which may amount to war crimes.

The government of the United States and aid agencies say genocide is been committed in Sudan.

UN IIC report faults former "Oil-for-Food" director
[[Wikinews:2005/February/3|February 3]], [[Wikinews:2005|2005]]

<div style="float:right">
[[Image:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|200px|[[w:United Nations|United Nations]] building in [[w:New York City|New York City]]]]
</div>
Former [[w:Chairman of the Federal Reserve|U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[w:Paul Volcker|Paul Volcker]] delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the [[w:United Nations|United Nation's]] [[w:Oil for Food program|Oil-for-Food program]] with [[w:Iraq|Iraq]] under [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]], which is sharply critical of the procurement process used and former program director [[w:Benon Sevan|Benon Sevan]].

Volker heads the [[w:Oil for Food program#UN investigation|Independent Inquiry Committee]], an investigation requested by [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] in June, 2004.

Annan has already responded to the report, ordering disciplinary action for Sevan and other UN officials of the former program.

Volker expects the report will go some ways to responding to critics of the UN program. "I think it's important to find out the extent those attacks are justified," he is quoted as saying. "There are obviously problems in the institution and we have identified some of them. But the end of this should be a reformed and stronger U.N., because I believe - and I know the other committee members believe - that the U.N. has an important role to play but it cannot be effective if it is under suspicion all of the time."

Charges that UN officials misused 1.4 billion [[w:US dollar|USD]] of administrative funds are unfair, Volker said. "We do not find evidence that this was a big slush fund," he said. "The money was carefully budgeted. They didn't spend all of the money they had budgeted. They gave some of it back to Iraq."

The Independent Investigation Committee report faulted the contract procurement process which selected Banque Nationale de Paris, Saybolt Eastern Hemisphere BV, and Lloyd's Register Inspection Limite, saying it did not conform to financial and competitive bidding standards. The choices were "clearly affected by political considerations" according to Volker.

Sevan is particularly faulted for personal financial transactions, including $160,000 over 1999-2003 which his lawyer has stated came from an aunt who has since died.

UN board supported Saddam Hussein's regime, says Iraq's ambassador
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.png|thumb|right|United Nations Flag]]
{{byline|date=February 6, 2005 |location=NEW YORK, United States}} 
At UN World Headquarters in [[w:New York|New York]] on Friday, February 4, 2005, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, [[w:Samir Sumaidaie|Samir Sumaidaie]], declared to reporters that the international body of the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] helped the regime of [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]]. This allegation came one day after the former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman [[w:Paul Volcker|Paul Volcker]] delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the United Nation's [[w:Oil-for-Food|Oil-for-Food]] program with [[w:Iraq|Iraq]] under Saddam Hussein. Sumaidaie says he has serious doubts about the role of the former UN [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|secretary-general]] [[w:Boutros Boutros-Ghali|Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] although there is no charge against him in the report.

In an interview with [[w:Voice of America|Voice of America ]] reporter Peter Heinlein, Sumaidaie [http://author.voanews.com/english/figleaf/ramfilegenerate.cfm?filepath=http%3A%2F%2F128%2E11%2E143%2E114%2Fmediaassets%2Fenglish%2F2005%5F02%2FAudio%2Frm%2FHeinleinUN%2DAnnan%2DOil%2DFor%2DFood4UpdateFeb05%2Erm      said[[Image:Loudspeaker.png]]]: "In the early days, the secretariat bent over backwards to please the Saddam regime. At that time it was Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was the Secretary-General. And the report asserts that he tried to please the Saddam government by accommodating its requests which laid the basis for most things that went wrong later.... What's clear to me is that Saddam and his regime were able to manipulate things in such a way as to get what they wanted out of this program."

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Sumaidaie said the inquiry's investigators were ignorant of the UN system and that their allegations were silly.

After being questioned by journalists, the current UN secretary-general [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] said: "Each Secretary-General has to do things his way and in accordance with the circumstances that he finds himself in. I think Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indicated in the report, the environment and the circumstances in which he was taking those decisions and I don't want to second-guess him."

On Friday, Annan said there were some hard knocks in the report and said he would take action promptly: "We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN, so we want to get to the bottom of it."

UN troops accused of rape in Congo; UN staff suspended due to Iraq Oil-for-Food corruption
{{date|February 13, 2005}}

[[w:United Nations|United Nations]] (UN) troops based in the [[w:Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]] face 150 allegations of [[w:rape|rape]] including gang rapes committed against children as young as twelve. 

The UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services reported these crimes which occurred even while investigators were in Congo. The [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General of the UN]], [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] has condemned the soldiers and has banned the peacekeeping troops (those deployed in Congo) from having sex with local residents.

The soldiers are believed to have bribed young starving children with eggs, milk or a few dollars to have sex. There are believed to be at least fifty different soldiers involved. Kofi Annan pledged personally to "root out this problem." The United Nations has 65,000 troops in 16 different locations, with 16,700 UN soldiers and other staff in Congo alone.

Annan also faces serious allegations of impropriety for the UN's $64 billion oil-for-food program which allegedly enriched Annan's relatives, senior officials within the [[w:Russia|Russia]]n and [[w:France|French]] governments and deposed [[w:Iraq|Iraq]]i president [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]]. The UN's own internal inquiry headed by former United States [[w:Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve]] Board chair [[w:Paul Volcker|Paul Volcker]] confirmed misconduct allegations leading to the termination of several senior UN officials.

The [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]], [[w:Rotary International|Rotary International]], the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and [[w:United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]] are leading the Initiative and coordinating a series of overlapping immunization campaigns in the region.

In 2004 [[w:Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[w:India|India]], and [[w:Pakistan|Pakistan]] cut their number of [[w:Polio|Polio]] cases by 45%. In 2005 the goal is to cut the number of cases by 100%.

The three countries are the last in Asia to have endemic polio, and the disease is confined to a small number of regions within the country. Only 186 cases were reported in 2004, down from 336 the previous year.

U.N. reports Afghan opium production is up again
{{date|February 11, 2005}}
<br>
[[Afghanistan]] is the #1 producer of {{w|opium}} in the world &mdash; responsible for 87% of all illicit opium production &mdash; according to reports from the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|Office on Drugs and Crime}} (UNODC), and its opium production has accelerated since the coalition invasion in 2001.

The November 2004 annual reports put out by UNODC show that Afghanistan opium production has been increasing each year since the coalition invasion. The UNODC report for 2004 shows a 64% increase over the previous year in the area of opium production, and a 22% increase in export value for the year({{w|United States dollar|US$}}2.8 billion).

"It could be brought under control with a good dose of law enforcement, which at the moment is lacking," Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of UNODC, said in an interview in 2003 when reports showed an increase in hectares under production of 8% over the previous year. "I believe that the war against terrorism, leaving aside addiction, will not be won unless we control the opium economy of Afghanistan."

Doug Wankel, Counter Narcotics Coordinator at the [[U.S.]] Embassy in {{w|Kabul}}, said the opium industry in Afghanistan is financing terrorism in an interview with USA Today. "It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism. ... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."

Calling the data "disheartening," UNODC reported that Afghanistan now produces three-fourths of the world's opium. The report estimated revenues from growing and trafficking to be half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product.

United Nations passes Declaration on human cloning
{{date|March 10, 2005}}
[[Image:UN General Assembly.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The declaration was passed at the UN general assembly]]

A divided [[UN]] [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] has voted to approve a nonbinding statement against all forms of {{w|human cloning}}.

The vote, held Tuesday, came after four years of debate and an end to attempts for an international ban.

In the 191-nation assembly, there were 84 votes in favor of a nonbinding statement, 34 against and 37 abstentions. 

Proposed by Honduras, the statement was largely supported by {{w|Roman Catholic}} countries and opposed by countries with active embryonic stem cell research programs. Many [[Islam]]ic nations abstained.

The ''{{w|UN Declaration on Human Cloning}}'', as it is named, calls for all member states to adopt a ban on human cloning, which it says is "incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life."

The {{w|US}}, which has long pushed for a complete ban, voted in favor of the statement while traditional ally {{w|UK|Britain}}, where {{w|therapeutic cloning}} is legal and regulated, voted against it.

The statement should have no impact on countries that allow therapeutic cloning, such as Britain and South Korea, as it is not legally binding.

"The foes of therapeutic cloning are trying to portray this as a victory for their ideology," Bernard Siegel, a {{w|Florida}} attorney who lobbies to defend therapeutic cloning, said in a {{w|Reuters}} report. "But this confusing declaration is an effort to mask their failure last November to impose a treaty on the world banning therapeutic cloning."

==Breakdown of the vote==

Six-year development framework for Sudan released by UN
[[Image:LocationSudan Africa.png|thumb|Sudan]]
{{date|March 11, 2005}}

The Joint Assessment Mission between the [[w:World Bank|World Bank]] and the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] released on March 9, 2005, a plan for the development of [[w:Sudan|Sudan]] over the six years remaining between January's peace agreement and the vote in 2011, in which southern Sudan will decide whether to break away from the north. The plan, titled "Framework for Sustained Peace, Development and Poverty Eradication in Sudan," describes two phases, the first through 2007, the second through mid-2008. The first phase will focus on emergencies and the repatriation of refugees, while the second will consist of "major infrastructural programs", according to the Sudan Tribune.

While the majority of the $7.8 billion needed for the development described in the plan will come from sources within the country, the plan asks for $2.66 billion from other countries. According to Reuters, the UN's Joint National Transition Team will hold a conference to ask for money in Norway in April.

Kofi Annan unveils UN reform plan
{{date|March 21, 2005}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.png|180px|right|Kofi Annan unveils UN reform plan]]
[[UN]] Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] will formally present a plan this morning to the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] when it meets in [[New York State|New York]] later today. The plan, entitled {{w|In Larger Freedom}}, is part of the UN's attempt to revitalise itself during its sixtieth anniversary year.

If implemented, this plan will be the largest change ever to the international body, calling for the addition of nine members to the [[UN Security Council|Security Council]], and for the creation of a new Human Rights Council to replace the 53-member {{w|United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Human Rights Commission}}.

The [[Canada|Canadian]] ambassador to the UN,  {{w|Allan Rock}}, was the first diplomat to officially respond by saying, "A lot of hard work lies ahead but we are optimistic." {{w|Oxfam}}, [[Amnesty International]], and other {{w|NGO|NGOs}}, have come out in support of the plan.

UN Reform: China, South Korea question seat for Japan on Security Council
{{date|March 23, 2005}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.png|180px|right|UN Reform]]
A [[South Korea]]n official expressed doubts over [[United Nations]] {{w|UN Secretary-General|Secretary-General}} [[Kofi Annan]]'s apparent support for a permanent [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] seat for [[Japan]], and attention has been drawn to widespread mistrust of Japan by [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] &mdash; although the Chinese government has not commented directly against Japan.

Asked to comment on Annan supporting Japan gaining the seat, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jianchao said, "I think reform of the UN Security Council should have its eyes on increasing work efficiency ... and at the same increasing the representation of developing countries."

Four hundred-thousand Chinese have signed an on-line petition opposing Japan's bid, and a poll last year put opposition within China at 95 percent. Resentment still runs high after Japan's invasion of China from 1931 to 1945 led to death or injury of up to 35 million Chinese, and sexual slavery of tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of women in mainland Asia.

The UN reforms currently being discussed are the largest changes since the body's formation 60 years ago.

Last year, Japan, [[Germany]], [[Brazil]], and [[India]] formed a lobby group supporting each other in bids for seats on the influential Security Council. But [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea|South Korea]] oppose Japan gaining a seat, [[Italy]] opposes Germany, [[Pakistan]] opposes India, and [[Mexico]] and [[Argentina]] oppose Brazil.

The [[United States]], [[UK|Britain]], [[France]], [[Russia]], and China are permanent members of the council, with the other 10 seats filled by other countries, selected from regional groups for two-year terms.

UN Security Council approves peacekeepers for Sudan
{{date|March 25, 2005}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.png|180px|right|United Nations flag]]The [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Security Council|Security Council}} approved the deployment of 10,000 peacekeeping troops and 715 civilian police to southern [[Sudan]]. They will monitor a peace plan that ended the country's 21 year long {{w|Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war}}.

The peacekeeping force will enforce a ceasefire agreement between Sudan's {{w|Khartoum}} government and the {{w|SPLA|Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)}}.

Jean-Marie Guehenno, head of UN peacekeeping operations, welcomed the Security Council's unanimous support of the resolution, but warned of "serious political hurdles" and "unprecedented logistical obstacles".

"If security does not improve quickly, the killings and rapes will continue. We must not allow allow this catastrophic scenario to become a foregone conclusion," he said.

Bush nomination to UN post faces bi-partisan problems
[[Image:John Bolton State Dept.jpg|thumb|right|Undersecretary of State [[John R. Bolton]] named North Korea as a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction in a speech at the American Center in Tokyo on Oct. 27, 2004]]
{{date|April 24, 2005}}

[[George W. Bush|George Bush's]] controversial nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, [[John R. Bolton]], seemed stalled as new allegations surfaced in the Senate Committee's second interview. Lawmakers from both parties, particularly [[Democratic Party (US)|Democrats]], express strong reservations.

=== Democrats argue against Bolton ===

"He wants to be our top diplomat at the UN but his life has been something less than diplomatic," {{w|Dick Durbin}}, the number two Democrat in the Senate, said on a Sunday talk show.

"He wants to work with people around the world. And he couldn't work with people in his own office. And he's supposed to be open, as our man at the UN, to ideas from other people," Durbin said.

"He's been a real tyrant when it came to people he worked with, who disagreed with him. This man doesn't have the temperament for this job."

There was no consensus Thursday whether the Senate committee should ask Bolton to return for more questioning. He testified for eight hours and presented a written draft on other questions, but the stream of allegations has only intensified, as well as a characterization of him as a boss who mistreated fellow workers and lost his temper frequently.

Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Bolton would be hobbled in the job because of the allegations raised during the confirmation hearings. Dodd spoke on CBS's "Face the Nation."

Dodd maintains the Democrats raise objections to Bolton because of evidence he twisted intelligence analysis to fit his personal views. He said Bush should consider withdrawing the nomination.

"There are plenty of other good people who embrace his ideological views," Dodd added.  

=== Republicans divided ===

But some Republicans had a differing view. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) thought Bolton's "forceful" personality made him the ideal candidate to lead U.S. efforts to reform the UN. He put little concern into Bolton's alleged personnel problems, saying that Bolton's supposed history of trying to get analysts who disagreed with him fired were unproven. McConnell is the second ranked Senate Republican. He was also speaking on the CBS program.

Lincoln Chafee, Republican Senator of Rhode Island, has said he is "less likely" to vote for the nominee as a result of the questions that are being raised about his credibility. Instead he sought out the opinion of former Secretary of State Colin Powell.

Powell's spokeswoman, Peggy Cifrino, said he returned calls Thursday to senators who wanted to discuss questions that have been raised about Bolton. Powell was the only former GOP secretary of state who did not sign a recent letter endorsing Bolton for the job. It is known that the two did not get along during Powell's tenure in the Bush Administration. Powell's former chief of staff has been quoted by the US press as saying Bolton would make an "abysmal ambassador."

Some Republicans in Congress are doubtful that Bolton will win nomination now that the vote has been pushed back to May 12 to allow more time to investigate his history. Speaking on CNN television Senator Arlen Spector, R-PA, said the odds on Bolton were "too close to call."

=== Bolton criticism of UN ===

Some wondered what Bush's reasoning could be for nominating Bolton for the UN post since Bolton acknowledged saying in 1994 that the UN headquarters in New York "has 38 stories. If it lost ten stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference."

Also in 1994, Bolton said, "There is no such thing as the United Nations. There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that's the United States, when it suits our interest and when we can get others to go along." [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/fedagencies/jan-june05/bolton_3-8.html]"

In response to criticism of these statements at his hearing, Bolton replied, "There's not a bureaucracy in the world that couldn't be made leaner."

=== Presidential support ===

It appears to trained observers that Bush may have to yield his nomination to a Senate rejection. Behind the scenes, Bolton may be facing a question of withdraw or be pushed out. As President Bush asked Senators to support his nominee, Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said he strongly supports Bolton, but "I can't speak for all of (GOP) leadership."

President Bush continues to support his nominee, according to Whitehouse spokespersons.  In an April 20 news briefing, press secretary Scott McClellan said in response to a question whether the Bolton nomination was lost, "No, absolutely not. I think what you're seeing is some Democrats on the committee trumping up allegations and making unsubstantiated accusations against someone the President believes will do an outstanding job at the United Nations. He is someone who has been an effective manager, a strong diplomat who has gotten things done. And I think he's earned the respect of many people that he has worked with because of what he's done....people are playing politics with his nomination....He's exactly the kind of person we need at the United Nations during this time of reform."

On Sunday, White House spokeswoman Christie Parell, said the president is standing by Bolton as his nominee.  "The president believes he's exactly the man needed at the United Nations," she said in reply to Dodd's comments.

Press advocacy groups in Africa are beginning a new campaign to remove "insult laws" from the books that protect political figures from criticism.  The laws, which are found to restrict freedom of expression to varying degrees of severity in 48 out of 53 African nations, result in the imprisonment of many political reporters for what they feel is necessary criticism of their governments.

The campaign was launched on Monday in [[w:Lusaka|Lusaka]], the capital city of Zambia.  The date was chosen so that the workshops would take place on [[w:World Press Freedom Day|World Press Freedom Day]] (Tuesday, May 3).  In the nation of Zambia, to take one example, a three-year jail sentence is prescribed for a journalist who defames or ridicules the President or any other prince.

The laws are supposed to exist to protect the dignity and reputation of public figures.  However, according to some critics, they are used to attack journalists who make personal references to some politicians, and those who allege misconduct or corruption by high public officials, such as heads of state or parliamentarians.

"We want to create awareness of these laws and lobby for their repeal in Africa," said research manager Kandji Kaitira of the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA).  

According to the Zimbabwe ''Daily News'', a number of African media groups are taking part in the effort, including World Press Freedom Committee, the Southern African National Editors' Forum, the Southern African Editors' Forum, the Southern African Journalists' Association, Journalistes en Danger (JED) of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Organisations of the Media in Central Africa, the Media Foundation for West Africa and Media Rights Agenda in Nigeria.

[[w:Kenya|Kenya]] in Africa, and some countries in South America, have already removed such laws from the books. However, in at least one [[w:European Union|European Union]] country, [[w:Poland|Poland]], insulting a head of state remains a crime (see [[w:freedom of speech#Poland|freedom of speech]]), though the January 5 [[2005]] conviction of [[w:Jerzy Urban|Jerzy Urban]] for having insulted [[w:pope John-Paul II|the pope]] could in principle be overturned by the [[w:European Court of Human Rights|European Court of Human Rights]].

== Negativism in coverage of Africa ==

Last month, the result of an unusual study by 11 former African presidents was announced in a [[w:Johannesburg|Johannesburg]] press conference.  The former leaders stated that based on their review of certain American outlets for the past decade (1994-2004), coverage was found to be overwhelmingly negative, crisis-driven and dismissive of Africa's democratic progress.  The result of this one-sidedness, they claim, actually becomes detrimental to further progress being made by Africa.

"Negative perceptions lead to negative outcomes &mdash; lower levels of aid and lower investments," said [[w:Joaquim Chissano|Joaquim Chissano]], one-time president of [[w:Mozambique|Mozambique]], who helped put an end to decades of civil war in his country.

The period was chosen because of a trend they saw toward democracy and free markets during that period in diverse nations.  Chissano said, "Coverage of Africa... is, at best, dismissive of the continent's progress and potential... At worst, coverage disregards recent trends towards democratisation, betraying an almost contemptuous lack of interest in the potential and progress being achieved on the continent," he said.

The ''New York Times'', ''Washington Post'', ''Wall Street Journal'', ''USA Today'' and ''US News and World Report'' were reviewed in the study.

== Ten stories the world should hear more about ==

To focus media awareness on World Press Freedom Day, the U.N. Department of Public Information (DPI) launched a new initiative it calls "Ten Stories the World Should Hear More About".  These are items that in the strongly expressed opinion of the U.N. spokesman, are critical issues which are not receiving adequate attention by the major media, compared to other stories which are focused on almost exclusively, such as Iraq.

Some of the stories concern ongoing conflicts and humanitarian crises to which the U.N. is responding, while others concern underreported good news.  For example:

<blockquote>
"Five: [[w:Tajikistan|Tajikistan]], rising from the ashes of civil war.  Again, you know, we often complain that while the cliche is that 'no news is good news',  when it comes to media and the U.N., 'good news is no news'.  Well, the fact is, here is a good news story, formidable challenges in the aftermath of a deadly civil war, and yet a country that is persisting on the road to peace and recovery &mdash; it hardly gets reported."
</blockquote>

The spokesman concluded:

<blockquote>
"Our staff and the public information staff of the various U.N. agencies are eager to work with you to raise the profile of these topics.  We have summaries available of the story behind each of the ten issues on the list... All of them list contact points from whom you can seek further information.  We've also posted links to more information sources on our website to help you if the list inspires you.  And these are also links to the U.N. officers and agencies concerned with each issue. And if it piques your curiosity sufficiently, we're happy to help by arranging interviews.  The staff of DPI and those of other U.N. offices are committed to working with you to help raise the world's awareness of these and other stories that we believe the world needs to know more about.  I urge you to use the initiative as a resource, as you go about your tough job, the business of covering the news.  After all you are one of the most, perhaps &mdash; we think &mdash; ''the'' most, important source of information about world events."
</blockquote>

The stories are listed on the new [http://www.un.org/events/tenstories/ Ten Stories] space on the U.N. website.

2005 Afghan opium harvest begins
{{date|May 3, 2005}}
[[File:Papaver somniferum 01.jpg|250px|thumb|Opium poppy.{{image|Catherine Giayvia}}]]
Most [[heroin]] sold in [[Europe]] comes from [[Afghanistan]]'s poppies. This past week, the 2005 opium harvest was in full view and going full speed in Afghanistan. The cultivators gathering resin from the crop are operating even near the main road through Kandahar and the farmers are out gathering resin from opium poppies in full view.

Last year 80% of the world's [[opium]] came from Afghanistan and production is up over 239% since 2003, according to U.S. government estimates.  Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of illegal drugs.

In {{w|Super Bowl XXXVI|2002 Super Bowl}} ads, the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House]] sent out the message that "drugs fund terrorists".  Doug Wankel, a former U.S. {{w|Drug Enforcement Administration}} (DEA) official, says the opium industry is "financing terrorism. It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."

"The Bush administration has decided not to destroy the opium crop in Afghanistan," stated a U.S. intelligence official returning from Afghanistan in relation to the 60% smaller 2002 crop. The source, who requested that he not be identified, noted "U.S. forces could destroy the crops using aerial spraying techniques, but no such actions are planned."

U.S. plans to spray the crops were canceled at the request of Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]], who has called for {{w|jihad}} or "holy war", but is concerned that aerial spraying could be harmful to the health of Afghan villagers.  The U.S. claims that the spraying would be safe, but is granting Karzai's request.

Karzai has indicated that he may change his mind if other U.S. strategies fail to halt the opium. Congress budgeted $774 million for anti-drug operations in Afghanistan just this year.

==== Estimating the value of the crop ====

The [[CIA]] reports in ''From Flowers to Heroin that'' it takes 10&nbsp;kg of opium to make 1&nbsp;kg of 90% pure heroin. The CIA states that impurities are introduced into the processed heroin before it hits the street, making the purity of the end consumer product about 40%.  That implies that 10&nbsp;kg of opium makes about 2.25&nbsp;kg of 40% pure heroin.

The Guardian reports that the 2002 opium harvest was 3400 metric tons. Using the conversion supplied by the CIA, 2002's 3400 opium harvest could be converted into 765 metric tons of heroin.  According to the International Narcotics Control Board, the 2003 opium harvest was 3600 metric tons.  Using the estimated 239% increase of the present harvast over 2003, it means that the 2005 harvest is about 8600 metric tons.

The 2002 street price of heroin in the UK was about 60 £ per GRAM, or (assuming the present 1.89 USD to 1 £ exchange) 113.40 USD per GRAM. As the supply goes up the price will come down some, so for this calculation only the 2002 figures will be used. If all the opium harvest is converted into heroin and all of it is sold at the UK street price, the total street value of the harvest is 86.7 billion USD. (765 metric tons x 1000&nbsp;kg/metric ton x 1000 grams/kg x 113.4 USD/gram = about 86.7 billion USD.)  To the extent the 2002 numbers are valid today, the street value of the 2005 harvest should be roughly twice the street value of the 2002 harvest, about 173 billion USD.

To put these numbers in perspective, the total market capitalization of Ford, General Motors and Daimler Chrysler combined is about 76 billion USD. The total market capitalization of Toyota and Honda combined is about 167 billion USD.

==== No Statement by the Financial Action Task Force  ====

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was formed to promote harmonization of international antimoney laundering (AML) laws. Despite the fact that tens of billions of USDs are generated from the Afgan opium harvest alone, the FATF has not added Afghanistan to its blacklist of uncooperative nations.  One has to wonder, therefore, what the poppy farmers are doing with their share of the money that escapes the notice of the banking system and the FATF.

U.S. Senate: U.K. and French politicians were allocated Iraqi oil
{{date|May 12, 2005}}

A [[w:United States|U.S.]] Senate committee, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), released evidence in a probe that purportedly suggests that two [[w:United Kingdom|U.K.]] and [[w:France|French]] politicians received vouchers for millions of barrels of [[w:Iraq|Iraqi]] oil in exchange for their support of [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein's]] regime under the [[w:United Nations|U.N.]] [[w:Oil-for-Food Programme|Oil-for-Food Program]] (OFP).

Under the OFP program, Iraq was allowed to sell its oil rights to whomever it wanted, and at a below-market price. These oil rights could then be re-sold for a higher price, usually between 3 and 30 cents a barrel. U.K. MP [[w:George Galloway|George Galloway]] and French Senate member [[w:Charles Pasqua|Charles Pasqua]] are accused of having these rights allocated to them as a reward for opposing the U.S lead economic sanctions on Iraq. However, no evidence was presented showing that those politicians had received any money benefit out of the scheme.

The PSI committee found Hussien-era documents that appear to show the two politicians received these oil rights. They also heard from officials from the old regime who confirmed the documents.

George Galloway, who won re-election to the [[w:Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] in a surprise victory, is accused of receiving allocations for 20 million barrels of oil. He is also accused of using the Mariam Appeal, a campaign he set up "''to campaign against sanctions on Iraq which are having disastrous effects on the ordinary people of Iraq''" which was best known for flying an Iraqi child to England for Leukemia treatment, to conceal the transfer of 3 million barrels of oil.

Galloway, a member of the new British left-wing anti-war Party, [[w:RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]], won a ferocious campaign for parliament last week in [[w:Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]], east London, where a sizable part of the population is of a Muslim southern Asian origin.

George Galloway won libel suits in the past against the [[w:en:Telegraph|Telegraph]] newpaper which claimed he had accepted bribes from the Iraqi regime. The Senate committee will be holding a further hearing on May 17, and have invited Galloway to attend, where he will be given a seat and a microphone.

Charles Pasqua, currently member of the Senate of France, was in the past [[w:Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], in charge of law enforcement, safety measures and relationships with local governments. His name has been cited in several corruption scandals inside France, though he has not been convicted. He currently heads a small [[w:en:Eurosceptic|Eurosceptic]] party with no representative in the National Assembly, and is generally considered to be somewhat close to Jacques Chirac's [[:w:Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] party, though he has distanced himself from that party from 1998 onwards.

Galloway and Pasqua deny any wrongdoing on their part in the oil-for-food program
{{date|May 17, 2005}}

Following accusations issued by the [[:w:United States Senate|United States Senate]] Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), British Member of Parliament [[:w:George Galloway|George Galloway]] and Senator [[:w:Charles Pasqua|Charles Pasqua]] of France  have vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

'''George Galloway''' declared:
<blockquote>
''I've now had a chance to read the report which was compiled without this Senate committee asking me a single question about these absurd allegations. I repeat once more. I have never traded or benefited from any oil deals with Iraq.''
<p>
''One of the companies named, with ostensible links to me-- Aredio Petroleum-- I have never heard of until today and I have certainly had no dealings with. The other company, Middle East Advanced Semiconductors, was owned by Fawaz Zureikat, who was the chairman of the Mariam Appeal. It is well-known that Mr Zureikat traded with Iraq but he did not do so on my behalf. I have not received a penny piece or any oil voucher from Iraq, directly or indirectly.''
<p>
''You would have thought that natural justice would have demanded that these allegations would have-- must have been!-- put to me, but they haven't been. Senator Joseph McCarthy would have been proud of this committee.''
</blockquote>

On May 17, Galloway appeared before the U.S. senatorial panel and vehemently denied any wrongdoing in a tone seldom used in a senatorial hearing. He accused the U.S. administration of creating a "smoke screen" to divert attention away from the situation in Iraq. He also declared, "The biggest sanctions busters were not me or Russian politicians or French politicians. The real sanctions busters were your own companies with the connivance of your own government." 

Galloway denied receiving any money out of the scheme.  Galloway demanded, "What counts is, where's the money, senator? Who paid me hundreds of thousands of dollars? The answer to that is nobody," while glaring toward U.S. senator [[:w:Norm Coleman|Norm Coleman]] ([[:w:US Republican Party|Republican]] from [[:w:Minnesota|Minnesota]]), according to a New York Times report.

Galloway also accused the US senators, especially senator Coleman, of shoddy standards of justice.  He claimed they have already ruled him guilty, and that they rely on dubious evidence and wrongful or coerced testimonies. 

Galloway declared:
<blockquote>''You have my name on lists provided to you... by the convicted bank robber and fraudster and con man [[w:Ahmed Chalabi|Ahmed Chalabi]], who many people, to their credit, in your country now realize played a decisive role in leading your country into the disaster in Iraq.''
<p>''In these circumstances, knowing what the world knows about how you treat prisoners in [[w:Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib prison]]<sup>1</sup>, in Bagram Air Base [Afghanistan], in [[w:Guantanamo Bay|Guantanamo Bay]] -- including, if I may say, British citizens being held in those places -- I'm not sure how much credibility anyone would put on anything you manage to get from a prisoner in those circumstances.''</blockquote>
<small>1. Alluding to the acknowledged [[w:Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]].</small>

'''Charles Pasqua''' also denies any personal wrongdoing in the case.  Pasqua indicated that he was "serene" and that he hoped the investigations by the U.S. Senate would probe the matter to the bottom. 

Pasqua judged the situation detrimental to relationships between the United States and France.  For this reason, Pasqua declared that he had asked the president of the French Senate for the creation of an investigation commission, wishing that the French and U.S. senatorial commissions should collaborate.

Pasqua declared himself convinced that misconduct took place in the oil-for-food program, and that it was probable that some French people were involved.  He then wished that they should be sought and prosecuted. "If one wants to find the origin of the financial streams, one can do so."  Pasqua mentioned the Swiss company Genmar, which the U.S. report claims to have served as Pasqua's intermediary.

Pasqua denied information presented as facts in the report.  For instance, he denied having met [[:w:Tariq Aziz|Tariq Aziz]], former Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq.

Pasqua pointed out that nothing in the senatorial evidence indicates that he had benefited from vouchers, only that one of his former advisers, Bernard Guillet, had received oil allocations in his name. From December 2000 onwards, allocations meant for Pasqua ceased and were replaced by allocations to Bernard Guillet.  

Guillet was arrested by French authorities in April in connection with abuses under the oil-for-food program. Mr Guillet has been put under formal investigation for allegedly participating in a system of occult kickbacks and fees between 1996 and 2001 involving major French companies, including [[w:Total (company)|Total]]. He is suspected of having received amounts of money without good explanation from an intermediary specialized in the resale of Iraqi oil.

Former Pasqua aide claims Iraq intended to reward Charles Pasqua, denies having received oil
{{date|May 18, 2005}}

A former aide to French senator [[w:Charles Pasqua|Charles Pasqua]], whose name was cited by a recent report by a [[w:United States Senate|United States Senate]] investigation panel, has admitted that the Iraqi government had intended to reward Mr Pasqua with a grant of oil through the [[w:oil for food|oil for food]] program.

The aide, Bernard Guillet, was arrested in April 2005 and was put under formal criminal investigation on April 28 by French judge Philippe Courroye, under the charges of egregious influence peddling and of being an accessory to an abuse of corporate belongings. He is suspected of having received vouchers for buying Iraqi oil from the regime of [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]], which he then allegedly sold to oil companies, to an amount of 5 million barrels. 

Mr Pasqua, according to some sources, would have been the beneficiary of 10.8 million barrels. According to a [[w:CIA|CIA]] report, the profit would have been between 0.15[[w:Euro|€]] and 0.85€ per barrel.

American Samoa asks again to be removed from U.N. colonies list

{{date|May 29, 2005}}

[[American Samoa]]'s government delivered another message to United Nations representatives asking to be removed from the [[w:United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|U.N.'s list of world colonies]].  Commerce Department Deputy Director Lelei Peau was participating in a regional seminar held from May 17-19 in [[w:Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] by the U.N. Decolonization Committee.

The U.N. has promoted [[w:decolonization|decolonization]] since its founding, particularly since its Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was adopted in 1960.  In 1945, about one-third of the world's population lived in dependent, non-self governing Territories.  Today the U.N. lists 16 remaining colonies with fewer than 2 million total people.

American Samoa is asking to be removed from that list, on the grounds that it wishes to remain a freely associated territory of the United States.  Its position has remained unchanged since the Lieutenant Governor first asked to be removed from the list in 1993.

"The position of the people of American Samoa, and its duly elected legislative representatives and government officials is that the current status of the Territory and the United States government is the desired relationship we wish to have," said Governor [[w:Togiola Tulafono|Togiola T. A. Tulafono]] last year.  His message was delivered to the U.N. Decolonization Committee in their regional seminar held in the Pacific island country of [[w:Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]].

{{missing image|Image:Gov Togiola Tulafono speech.jpg|thumb|200px|left|American Samoan Governor Togiola T.A. Tulafono}}

"It has been a partnership that has aided both our peoples and the bonds of friendship between us are strong. We ask again that American Samoa be delisted as a 'colony' of the United States," said the governor's message.

The United States position, expressed to the U.N. General Assembly in 2003, is that its remaining territories are already in large measure self-governing.  These territories should be able to choose whether to be independent states as "equal and sovereign partners" of the United States, or remain integrated within the United States.

The legislature of American Samoa, called the Fono, has approved a Future Political Status Commission to study public opinion on possibly becoming a commonwealth or freely associated state.

Africa faces food crisis, UN Security Council told
{{date|July 1, 2005}}

The head of the {{w|World Food Programme}}, James Morris, has told the [[United Nations Security Council]] that Africa is facing a food crisis, with one in three people there malnourished.

[[Zimbabwe]] is one country that Morris is particularly concerned about at the moment. 

“It does not matter whether that instability is caused by civil conflict, drought, AIDS, poor governance or any combination of those factors-hunger almost always comes with it,” said Morris.

“The impact of rural-urban migration on employment in Africa has been precisely the opposite of Western Europe and the United States - it has led to higher rather than lower rates of unemployment and social instability. 

“At a certain point the capacities of local governments are stretched to the limit and social demands are not met, especially among competing ethnic groups perhaps not accustomed to sharing the same political space.”

In addition to Zimbabwe, 1.6 million in [[Malawi]], 1.2 million in [[Zambia]], 900,000 in [[Mozambique]], 245,000 in [[Lesotho]], 230,000 in [[Swaziland]], and 60,000 in [[Namibia]] all need emergency food aid.

According to Morris, the World Food Programme has been told by the Zimbabwe government that they will feed the people, which goes against the policies of the WFP. 

Morris highlighted the effects hunger can have - destabilizing countries and threatening peace and security. Food shortages are driving people into urban areas, where they are confronted by high unemployment and social instability.

U.N. to begin forming response to Iranian nuclear program
{{date|August 9, 2005}}
[[Image:IAEA flag.png|thumb|right|140px|International Atomic Energy Agency flag]]
A meeting set for Tuesday by the {{w|International Atomic Energy Agency}} (IAEA) could be a move closer to a showdown at the [[United Nations]] over the [[Iran]]ian plan to resume uranium conversion at its Isfahan nuclear facility.

Iran on Monday refused the weekend offer by the [[European Union]] (EU) of economic incentives that included help with nuclear-energy generation. The EU, led by Britain and France, both of which in May 2005 [http://www.un.org/events/npt2005/] were considered to have violated the ''first pillar'' of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by failing to make serious efforts to dismantle their nuclear bomb stockpiles (preamble and Article VI of the treaty), and Germany, combined the offer with an exchange for Iran to verifiably give up all activities that could lead to a nuclear bomb.

Iranian officials insist their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, and say it is part of Iran's right to develop nuclear power, as is legally agreed to in the ''third pillar'' of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which gives all states the right to peacefully use nuclear technology. "The proposals are unacceptable," Hossein Moussavian said.  "They negate Iran's inalienable right," said the top Iranian nuclear negotiator. 

The Iranian refusal, coming from under the new leadership of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], would probably trigger the referral of Iran to the [[UN Security Council]].

Iran began uranium conversion shortly after IAEA inspectors installed cameras and other surveillance equipment at their nuclear facility. The facility carried out an early stage of the fuel cycle, which includes turning raw uranium ({{w|yellowcake}}) into gas.  France and Britain condemned Iran's actions.

The IAEA sealed sensitive equipment at Iran's uranium conversion facility at Isfahan and its uranium enrichment plant at Natanz, as part of {{w|Tehran|Tehran's}} earlier compliance with a Paris agreement. An ''[[Al-Jazeera]]'' report said the IAEA seals on the plants' sensitive equipment was recently removed.

In a IAEA statement issued Monday, ''{{w|Reuters}}'' reports, "It should be noted that the sealed parts of the process line remain intact."

Oil for food scandal: UN releases third report
{{date|August  9, 2005}}

The [[w:UN|UN]]-appointed panel investigating the [[w:oil for food|oil for food]] scandal has released its third report. 

The report says that [[w:Benon Sevan|Benon Sevan]] took nearly US$150,000 in cash bribes. Chef de Cabinet for Kofi Annan, Mark Malloch Brown, said that the UN would lift Sevan's immunity should an approach come from a law enforcement authority and that the UN had been in 'active collaboration' with the Southern District of New York. 

At the press conference responding to the report, Malloch Brown also said that there was will "a real need for serious, deep-rooted management reform of our organization, and that does not seem to be yet fully accepted by all member states."

Benon Sevan, who worked for the UN for nearly 40 years before resigning on Sunday, has denied the accusation. In his resignation letter to Kofi Annan, he wrote: "The charges are false and you, who have known me all these years, should know they are false... I fully understand the pressure you are under..., but sacrificing me for political expediency will never appease our critics or help you or the organisation."

A former UN procurement officer [[w:Alexander Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]] has pleaded guilty to accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from UN contractors.

UN holding recruitment exams in under-represented countries
{{date|September 7, 2005}}

In order to find P-2 level officers for the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Secretariat|Secretariat}}, the international organization is holding competitive recruitment competitions in 42 countries. The examinations will take place in February, 2006.

Six occupational groups are being sought: [[Architecture]], Demography, Library, Security, Science and Technology, and Statistics. There will be a written examination (both a general paper and a specialised paper) and an interview.

The written examination questions are given in English and French, the two working languages of the Secretariat. Candidates must write their answers for the general paper in English or French. However, they may write their answers for the specialized paper in English, French, or any of the other four official languages of the Secretariat, i.e., Arabic, Chinese, Russian, or Spanish.

The examinations will take place on February 28, 2006 in [[New York City|New York]], [[Addis Ababa]], {{w|Andorra La Vella}}, [[Athens]], [[Bangkok]], [[Beirut]], [[Geneva]], [[Monaco]], [[Nairobi]], [[Santiago]], {{w|Vaduz}}, {{w|Valletta}}, and [[Vienna]].

According to the UN, applicants "should hold at least a first-level {{w|university degree}} relevant to the occupational group in which they would like to take the examination.  Furthermore, applicants should not be more than 32 years old on 31 December, 2006 ... Fluency in either English or French is required."

The following countries have been selected for the 2006 competition: [[Andorra]], [[Angola]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Barbados]], [[Botswana]], [[Brunei Darussalam]], [[Cabo Verde]], [[Comoros|Comores]], [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Gambia]], [[Japan]], [[Greece]], [[Grenada]], [[Guatemala]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Israel]], [[Kiribati]], [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Maldives]], [[Malta]], [[San Marino]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mexico]], [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]], [[Moldova]], [[Monaco]], [[Norway]], [[Oman]], [[Panama]], [[Portugal]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Samoa]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Switzerland]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Tonga]], [[Tuvalu]], [[USA]], and [[Vietnam]].

The practice of scouting under-represented nations for highly-qualified employees is an annual occurrence.

The United Nations Secretariat is one of the principal organs of the United Nations and it is headed by the United Nations Secretary General and assisted by a staff of international civil servants worldwide. It provides studies, information, and facilities needed by United Nations bodies for their meetings. It also carries out tasks as directed by the [[UN Security Council]], the [[UN General Assembly]], the UN Economic and Social Council, and other UN bodies. The United Nations Charter provides that the staff be chosen by application of the "highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity," with due regard for the importance of recruiting on a wide geographical basis.

UN inquiry finds mismanagement and failure of oversight

The Independent Inquiry Committee's report on the overall management and oversight of the UN's {{w|Oil-for-Food Programme}} has concluded that the [[United Nations]] requires stronger executive leadership, thorough administrative reform, and more reliable controls and auditing.

The Programme included more than $103 billion in transactions (over $64 billion in oil sales and almost $39 billion for food).  

Responsibility for what went wrong with the Programme is assigned to the {{w|UN Secretariat}}, members of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], its 661 Committee, and the Iraqi regime.  In a change from past practice, the Security Council had retained substantial elements of administrative control through its 661 Committee.  This caused neither the Secretariat leadership nor the Security Council to be in overall control.

There was reluctance of both the {{w|United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General}} and the Deputy Secretary-General to recognize their own responsibility for the Programme's shortcomings and they failed to ensure that critical evidence was brought to the attention of the Security Council and the 661 Committee.  They only made minimal efforts to address sanctions violations with Iraqi officials, and both failed to provide oversight of the Programme's Executive Director, Benon Sevan.

[[Image:TrialSaddam.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Saddam Hussein, leader of Iraqi regime.]]
As the Programme expanded and continued, [[Saddam Hussein]] found ways and means of turning it to his own advantage, primarily through demands for surcharges and kickbacks from companies doing business with the Programme.  For UN agencies, the work went beyond their core competencies of overseeing the distribution of humanitarian goods—from monitoring, planning, and consulting—to infrastructure rebuilding, thus multiplying problems.  Nor was there much success in coordinating so large a program among UN Agencies accustomed to zealously defending their institutional autonomy.

There were Iraqi attempts to pass money to former Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, principally through an Iraqi-American businessman, Samir Vincent, and a Korean lobbyist, Tongsun Park.  The Committee has determined that well over $1 million was paid to Mr. Vincent and Mr. Park. However, the Committee has not found evidence that Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali received or agreed to receive monies from Mr. Park and Mr. Vincent.

The report recommended better oversight and management, financial disclosure by more UN staff, and that UN agencies should return up to $50 million in excess compensation secured as a result of work performed under Security Council Resolution 1483.

The Committee's Chairman, Paul A Volcker, stated, "The inescapable conclusion from the Committee's work is that the United Nations Organization needs thoroughgoing reform—and it needs it urgently. What is important—what has been recognized by one investigation after another—is that real change must take place, and change over a wide area. Clear benchmarks for measuring progress must be set.  The General Assembly should insist, in its forthcoming meeting, that key reforms be put in place no later than the time of its regular meeting in 2006. To settle for less, to permit delay and dilution, would be to invite failure.  It would, in reality, further erode public support, undercut effectiveness, and dishonor the ideals upon which the United Nations is built."

He added, "Before concluding its work, the Committee also intends a more comprehensive listing of firms participating in the Programme, either in the purchase of oil or the sale of humanitarian goods, as well as a more detailed analysis of the manner in which Iraq and its vendors and oil purchasers unlawfully manipulated the Programme."

Report: Annan failed to fix Oil for Food program
{{date|September  9, 2005}}
[[Image:Kofi Annan.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Kofi Annan]]]]
After a year-long investigation, a committee has found that [[w:en:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]], head of the [[w:en:United Nations|United Nations]], failed to halt corruption in the [[w:en:Oil for Food|Oil for Food]] program, which was supposed to provide food to impoverished [[w:Iraq|Iraqi]] citizens. 

According to [[w:en:Paul Volcker|Paul Volcker]], head of the Independent Inquiry Committee,  "Our assignment has been to look for mis-or mal-administration in the oil-for-food program and for evidence of corruption within the UN organization and by contractors. Unhappily, we found both." 

The report emphasized that Annan knowingly allowed [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]] to continue making huge unethical profits off of the program.

While Annan acknowledged that there was blame to pass around, he stated that "None of us -- member states, Secretariat, agencies, funds and programs -- can be proud of what it has found." Annan also says that he was at least partly at fault for the corruption; "The report is critical of me personally, and I accept its criticism."

On a lighter note, while the report is critical of Annan, it also says that the Oil for Food program did help get food to many Iraqis.

Chavez wants UN uprooted from New York
[[Image:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|thumb|200px|right|United Nations headquarters, New York City.]]
{{date|September 16, 2005}}

In a speech before the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] President [[Hugo Chávez]] called for the {{w|UN headquarters}} to be moved out of the [[United States]].

Chávez cited the [[Iraq War]] and the US' alleged disregard for the will of the United Nations as his reasoning for proposing the pullout.  He then went on to criticize the proposed UN reforms, saying they were "illegal" as they did not take into account anti-poverty goals set out in a 2000 summit.  Proposing sweeping reforms, including the elimination of Security Council members' veto powers, Chávez described the UN as unfit for the 21st century.

[[Image:HugoChavez1824.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|President Chávez speaks in 2003.<br><small>Source: Victor Soares/ABr</small>]]
In a comment more related to the frosty relationship between the US and Venezuela, Chávez expressed regret that [[Pat Robertson]] remained at liberty.  Chávez has branded Robertson a terrorist for implying that the US would do well to assassinate the Venezuelan President.

The current summit marks the sixtieth anniversary of the formation of the United Nations, and many world leaders have gathered to work out reforms to the organization to make it more relevant in today's world.

UN agrees on reform document
{{date|September 17, 2005}}
[[Image:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|thumb|200px|right|United Nations headquarters, New York City.]]
A deal to reform the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] has been signed at the end of a summit marking the organisation's sixtieth anniversary.

The summit was the largest gathering of heads of state ever, with over 150 in attendance.  During its three days, [[w:Syria|Syria]] was the only one of the 191 represented nations not to address the [[w:General Assembly|General Assembly]].

The [[w:United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]], [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]], had put forward a wide-ranging set of reform proposals encompassing [[w:poverty|poverty]], [[w:war|war]], [[w:genocide|genocide]], and reform of the organisation itself.

Of the reforms that got through the intense diplomatic negotiations, Responsibility to Protect is one of the most significant. Rather than waiting for genocide to be demonstrated, the international community has now agreed to act in cases of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. A peacebuilding commission is also to be established by December 2005.

The opinions expressed by participants varied, with [[w:Venezuela|Venezuelan]] President, [[w:Hugo Chavez|Hugo Chavez]] condemning the document as having been "conceived in darkness".  In stark contrast, [[w:United States|United States]] ambassador, [[John R. Bolton]], praised the document.

World Food Program told to leave North Korea
{{date|September 23, 2005}}
{{Human rights infobox}}
[[North Korea]]n Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Su-hon has asked the [[United Nations]]  {{w|World Food Program}} (WFP) to stop providing food aid in the country.

Claiming a good harvest provided the country with sufficient food, and that the {{w|US}} was politicizing the aid issue, the formal request to end all humanitarian aid was made to {{w|United Nations Secretary General|UN Secretary General}} [[Kofi Annan]] at a meeting on September 21.

The WFP has been feeding approximately six million of the poorest and most needy in the reclusive communist state.  There is much concern its withdrawal will leave many without adequate aid.
{{Audio|World Food Program told to leave North Korea.ogg|2005-09-23}}
Neighbouring countries, including {{w|China}} and {{w|South Korea}}, will continue to supply food aid to the North Koreans; however, the donors do not manage this aid and international organisations are unable to determine that it is reaching those who need it.

The request for the WFP's withdrawal is suspected by some to be related to the ongoing talks about the nuclear program of North Korea; continued acceptance of aid is seen as a weakness that may influence their negotiating position.

IAEA and its director ElBaradei are awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
{{date|October  7, 2005}}
<!--[[Image:IAEA_flag.png|thumb|right|The Flag of the IAEA]]-->
[[Image:IAEA-Nobel2005-press-address.jpg|thumb|250px|right|IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei addressing the media]]
The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), a [[UN]] agency, and its Director [[Mohammed ElBaradei]] have been awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for [[2005]], the committee's chairman Professor Ole Danbolt Mjøs announced today.

In the announcement, the {{w|Norwegian Nobel Committee}} emphasizes the role the IAEA plays in preventing military use of nuclear energy arms proliferation, and ensuring peaceful use of nuclear energy. Furthermore, the Committee notes that IAEA's work is in line with {{w|Alfred Nobel}}'s original motivation for the Peace Prize, namely the reduction of standing armies. The committee expressed its belief that the increasing threat of nuclear arms today must be met through the broadest possible international cooperation, as exemplified in the work of the IAEA.

A spokeswoman for the IAEA, Melissa Flemming, said in {{w|Vienna}}: "I never thought we'd see this day. This is the proudest day for the IAEA. We are proud, astonished, elated."

The IAEA, headquartered in Vienna and established in 1957, seeks to prevent [[nuclear proliferation]] and promotes the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It is currently involved in efforts to bring DPRK (North Korea) back to the {{w|Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty}} (NPT) regime and verifying the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. These negotiations have been difficult, and are viewed by some [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1815682,00.html] as not very successful.

The 63-year old Mohamed ElBaradei, an Egyptian-born lawyer, heads the agency since 1997 and was recently confirmed for a third term.

US rejects EU proposal to give Internet control to the UN
{{date|October 3, 2005}}

The [[w:United States|United States]] announced it does not agree with the [[w:European Union|European Union]] officials' proposal to share more of the control of the [[w:Internet|Internet]] with the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]. U.S. Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs Ambassador [[w:David Gross|David Gross]] said, "We will not agree to the U.N. taking over the management of the Internet." Mr. Gross is coordinator for international communications and information policy at the U.S. Department of State and said further, "Some countries want that. We think that's unacceptable. No intergovernmental body should control the Internet, whether it's the U.N. or any other." 

E.U. spokesman Martin Selmay said, "We are looking for a new cooperation model; a model that allows Internet governance and the laying down of public policy principles in coordination by all countries which are interested in the governance of the Internet, because the Internet is a global resource."

The [[w:Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers|Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), a non-profit organization responsible for  the assignment of domain names and Internet Protocol addresses, currently controls the root zone files for the Internet. They are overseen by the U.S. Commerce Department, which granted them the original contract to oversee those tasks. 

Many nations have expressed displeasure at the U.S. having sole control of the Internet and suggest such control should be given to an intergovernmental body, such as the U.N. Other proposals include limiting ICANN to a technical role and establishing a new external organization to handle policy issues.   

The issue is scheduled to be discussed in November at the U.N. [[w:World Summit on the Information Society|World Summit on the Information Society]] in [[w:Tunis|Tunis]], Tunisia.

U.S. isolated in opposition to cultural diversity treaty
{{date|October 19, 2005}}

The [[w:United States|United States]] has become increasingly isolated this week in its stance against a new treaty designed to protect and promote cultural diversity in the age of transnational media industries. The treaty, called the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expressions, was sponsored by Canada and France and has been negotiated by government delegates from over 180 countries in a 2-year consensus process. It is expected to be approved later this week by the plenary session of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization [[w: UNESCO|UNESCO]]. 

The treaty grants individual countries a right "to maintain, adopt, and implement policies and measures they deem appropriate for the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions on their territory". This is designed to protect national cultural policy from 'free trade' agreements like the WTO/GATS, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, or bilateral trade negotiations. For example, the screenquota system in South Korea that requires Korean cinemas to show [[w:Korean cinema|Korean films]] about 50% of the time, which supporters argue has nurtured the growth of the Korean movie industry, would likely be eliminated if audiovisual services were brought into the WTO - as the United States Trade Representative has proposed. Other countries, like [[w:France|France]] and [[w:Canada|Canada]] have similar policies in place to support their local artists and film industry.

Promoters of the treaty argued that it will allow countries to promote and maintain cultural diversity. The British ambassador to UNESCO characterized the draft as "clear, carefully balanced, and consistent with principles of international law and fundamental human rights".

The United States government criticized the treaty on the grounds it would encourage trade protectionism and could serve as a justification for repressive governments to control their media systems. [[w:Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice]] wrote letters encouraging governments to oppose the treaty. 

The United States stood largely alone in that position. Last Monday night, the United States was only joined by [[w:Israel|Israel]] to vote for some last minute amendments brought in by the U.S., whereas 151 nations voted for the original wording of the treaty. [[w:Australia|Australia]] and [[w:Kiribati|Kiribati]] abstained.

U.N. denied access to Guantanamo inmates
{{date|November 1, 2005}}

Today, [[w:United States|U.S.]] [[w:U.S. Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[w:Donald Rumsfeld|Donald Rumsfeld]] renewed his denial to grant a [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] commission access to inmates at the [[w:Guantanamo Bay|Guantánamo Bay]] detention center. Last week the United States offered to let United Nations representatives visit the detention center, but they refused to let United Nations representatives visit the entire detention facility or interview detainees.

The United Nation's Special Rapporteur on torture, Manfred Nowak, told reporters on Monday that even China does not impose such conditions for United Nations visit of detention centers and that the United Nations could not accept an offer to visit the United States facility under conditions that are different from other nations. Nowak did show willingness to compromise on other controversial questions as the duration of the visit, which is limited to one day, and which individual United Nations representatives would be involved in the visit.

The United States has voiced objections to two of the proposed team of five United Nations inspectors: Leandro Despouy, Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and Paul Hunt, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Paul Hunt in particular has expressed strong suspicion of torture having occurred in Guantánamo. Those approved include Nowak from Austria in position as Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Asma Jahangir from Pakistan as Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and Leila Zerrougui from Algeria as Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention.

The United Nations has been requesting access to the naval base for four years.  The United States has explained that the restrictions placed on the UN visit are due to the nature of the ongoing [[w:War on Terrorism|War on Terrorism]].

A [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] health expert who is co-ordinating the response to the recent south-east Asian [[w:bird flu|bird flu]] outbreak, has warned that the disease could kill 'up to 150 million' people in the near future.

[[w:Dr David Nabarro|Dr David Nabarro]] told the [[w:BBC|BBC]] that a new outbreak of bird flu was possible, with migratory birds carrying the disease to Africa or the Middle East where the human death toll "could be anything between 5m and 150m".

"The consequences in terms of human life when the pandemic does start are going to be extraordinary and very damaging."

Bird flu &mdash; also known as avian influenza &mdash; is a type of influenza virulent in birds. It was first identified in [[w:Italy|Italy]] in the early [[w:1900s|1900s]] and is now known to exist worldwide. It was not known to affect humans until the first recorded case in [[w:Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] in [[w:1997|1997]].

Bird flu has spread rapidly through poultry and wild birds in Asia since [[w:2003|2003]], killing huge numbers of birds and more than 60 humans.

"It's like a combination of [[w:global warming|global warming]] and [[w:HIV|HIV/Aids]] 10 times faster than it's running at the moment," Dr Nabarro said.

In contrast to the shock-factor of Dr Nabarro's comments, the U.N. has distanced themselves from his remarks.  The [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]]'s official estimate for the death toll in the event of a mutation of the H5N1 virus is between 2 and 7.4 million.  WHO influenza spokesman, Dick Thompson, implied that Dr Nabarro would be taken to task over his remarks, stating, "I don't think you will hear Dr Nabarro say the same sort of thing again."

UN Report: Earth ecosystem in peril
{{date|March 31, 2005}}
A report Tuesday from a [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]-backed project, consulting more than 1,300 scientists from 95 countries, and written over the last four years, warns that 60 percent of the basics of life on Earth &mdash; water, food, timber, clean air &mdash; are currently being used in ways which degrade them. Furthermore, fisheries and fresh water use-patterns are unsustainable, and getting worse.

"The harmful consequences of this degradation could grow significantly worse in the next 50 years," according to a press release from the [[w:Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA)]], a massive four-year study begun in 2001.

"We've had many reports on environmental degradation, but for the first time we're now able to draw connections between ecosystem services and human well-being," Cristian Samper, director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington and a chief architect of the study, told the Christian Science Monitor.

The project's [http://www.maweb.org/proxy/document.aspx?source=database&TableName=Documents&IdField=DocumentID&Id=356&ContentField=Document&ContentTypeField=ContentType&TitleField=Title&FileName=MA+General+Synthesis+-+Final+Draft.pdf&Log=True ''Synthesis Report''], first in a series of eleven documents and published yesterday, explains the objective: ''"to assess the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and to establish the scientific basis for actions needed to enhance the conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems and their contributions to human well-being."''

It then goes on to report on four main findings:

* ''Changes over the last 50 years to meet rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fiber and fuel, have effected substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.''

* ''Net gains in human well-being and economic development are offset by growing costs, in the form ecosystem degradation, the possibility of abrupt and unpredictable ecosystem changes, and worsened poverty for some groups. Unless addressed, these problems will substantially diminish the benefits that future generations obtain from ecosystems.''

* ''Ecosystem degradation could grow significantly worse over the next 50 years, presenting a barrier to meeting UN  Millennium Development Goals.''

* ''The challenge of reversing the degradation while meeting increasing ecological demands can be partially met under some scenarios, but only with significant changes in policies, institutions and practices  &mdash; changes that are not currently under way.''

Walter Reid, the study's director, speaking at yesterday's [[:w:London|London]] launch of the report said it shows that over the last 50 years "humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable time in human history."

"This has resulted in substantial and largely irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth," he said.

It is unclear what this will mean to future generations or the possible emergence of new diseases, absence of fresh water and the continuing decline of fisheries and completely unpredictable weather.

With half of the urban populations of [[:w:Africa|Africa]], [[:w:Asia|Asia]], [[:w:Latin America|Latin America]] and the [[:w:Caribbean|Caribbean]] suffering from several diseases associated with these problems, the death toll is reaching 1.7 million people a year. Entire species of mammals, birds and amphibians are disappearing from the planet at nearly 1,000 times the natural rate, according to the study. Oxygen-depleted coastal waters and rivers result from overuse of nitrogen [[:w:fertilizer|fertilizer]] - an effect known as "nutrient loading" which leads to continuing [[:w:biodiversity|biodiversity]] loss.

With the United States' non-participation in the [[w:Kyoto Treaty|Kyoto Treaty]], former U.S. Senator Timothy Wirth, president of this U.N. Foundation, says  "U.S. leadership is critical in providing much-needed expertise, technological capabilities and ingenuity to restore ecosystems.

"We can take steps at home to reduce our nation's adverse impact on the global environment."

"At the heart of this assessment is a stark warning," said the 45-member board.

UN accuses US of wholesale rights violations in Iraq
{{date|December  5, 2005}}
John Pace, [[w:human rights|human rights]] chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), condemned both the US-installed Iraqi government and the US Armed Forces for breach of human rights, centring largely around widespread [[w:habeas corpus|detention without authority or trial]].

"There is no question that terrorism has to be addressed. But we are equally sure that the remedies being applied... are not the best way of eliminating terrorism," Pace said during an interview on Sunday. <!-- with whom? -->

He quoted instances where Iraqi judges had ordered the release of groups of prisoners, and had found not only that their orders had been refused, but found themselves locked up as a reprisal.

On the subject of the [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]] trial resuming Monday, Pace told ''Reuters'', "Weakness in the system of administration of justice, in addition to the antecedents surrounding the establishment of this tribunal, will never be able to produce the kind of process that would be able to satisfy international standards." 

He also pointed out that the Iraqi authorities are the only legal entity allowed to detain prisoners, and that the US prison camps at [[w:Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] and similar locations are therefore technically illegal.

Bush threatens U.N. over Clinton climate speech
{{date|December 10, 2005}}

Officials in the [[w:George W. Bush|Bush]] administration privately threatened the organizers of the [[w:United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[w:Montreal|Montreal]], saying that any chance there might have been for the [[w:United States|United States]] to sign the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]] would be lost if [[Bill Clinton]] spoke Friday at the meeting.

The threat was received within minutes of the [[w:Associated Press|Associated Press]] running a story on Clinton being added to the program.  "It's just astounding." said one organizer. "It came through loud and clear from the Bush people—they wouldn't sign the deal if Clinton were allowed to speak."

Clinton said, "There's no way that I'm gonna let petty politics get in the way of the deal. So I'm not gonna come."  The organizers later reported that they had "called the administration's bluff."  Clinton delivered his speech as planned.

In his speech Friday, Clinton described the Bush administration's opposition to Kyoto as "flat wrong."

Vice-President [[Dick Cheney]] directed the U.S. envoy to walk out Thursday, in response to comments by [[Canada|Canadian]] Prime Minister [[w:Paul Martin|Paul Martin]] on Thursday.  The walk out is not believed to relate to Clinton's attendance.

UN warns neighbours of Turkey about bird flu
{{date|January 11, 2006}}
{{Avian Flu infobox}}
The [[United Nations]] Food and Agriculture Organization has asked countries neighbouring [[Turkey]], specifically mentioning [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], and [[Syria]], to be cautious and take measures to prevent the [[avian flu]], H5N1, from spreading. The UN also warned that civilians in these countries should be given more information about the disease. 

Two people have died in Turkey so far, possibly a third, and more hospitalized, after contracting the flu virus. All 15 confirmed cases in Turkey had close contact with birds. As of now, the H5N1 virus strain does not pass easily to humans and does not spread at all between humans.

Two-day bird flu conference draws $1.9 billion in pledges
{{Avian Flu infobox}}
{{date|January 19, 2006}}
In Beijing, China, 1.9 billion US dollars in pledges came from 33 countries and a host of multilateral institutions at the end of a meet co-ordinated by the [[w:World Bank|World Bank]]. The amount exceeded the organization's estimate of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in funds required to contain the [[w:avian flu|avian flu]] over the next three years. In addition to aiding research efforts, the money is expected to help strengthen surveillance and increase the stockpiling of surgical masks and other equipment. 

The United States was the largest donor, pledging $334 million in grants. Japan pledged $159 million while the European Union pledged $120 million. The EU member nations promised an additional $138 million.

China which is home to a third of the entire world's population of birds pledged $10 million to help other countries with the effort.  Jia Youling, China's chief veterinary official defended the relatively small pledge claiming that China was still a developing country and faced a serious challenge from bird flu within its borders. Premier [[w:Wen Jiabao|Wen Jiabao]] personally attended the conference and announced that the country would share more information on outbreaks in the country, including samples that will assist in tracing genetic changes.

Dr. Lee Jong-wook, the director general of the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]], believes that the Chinese government was fully committed to sharing information openly and freely about bird flu cases. But he cautions that it would be difficult to stay fully informed about every health development in a country as populous as China.

Dr. Lee also expressed his concern about reports that children in Turkey have now become infected with the A([[w:H5N1|H5N1]]) avian influenza virus without becoming ill. Some studies suggest that the disease must become less lethal before it can cause a global epidemic, he noted. There is concern that patients may continue to infect more people by going through their daily routines if the flu symptoms remain mild.

Some scientists note that the avian flu has been known to occur among poultry in southern China since at least 1996. They are encouraged that the avian flu virus has failed to evolved into a form that is transmittable by people in all this time. This could be an indication that this would never happen. But others including officials from the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] [[w:Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization]] disagree claiming that increased contact between infected poultry and people raises the odds that the virus may eventually adapt better for transmission among humans.

Iran reported to U.N. Security Council
{{date|February  4, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag of IAEA.svg|190px|thumb|Symbol of the IAEA.]]
[[Image:Flag_of_Iran.svg|200px|thumb|National flag of Iran.]]
The [[IAEA]] board has passed a resolution to report [[Iran]] to the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The decision by the 35-nation board came on Saturday. 

The resolution was made without waiting for the director of the IAEA, [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], to finish preparing a report on {{w|Iran's nuclear program|Iran's civilian}} (and {{w|Iran and weapons of mass destruction|allegedly military}}) nuclear programs for the regular IAEA meeting scheduled for March 6. According to [[al-Jazeera|''al-Jazeera'']], ElBaradei refused to accept pressure from Western states to finish his report in advance of the March 6 meeting. ElBaradei said in written responses to requests by the [[United States|US]] and [[European Union|EU]] member states that he had given Iran until the meeting in March to answer questions to IAEA enquiries, stating, ''Due process, therefore, must take its course before <nowiki>[we are]</nowiki> able to submit a detailed report''. ElBaradei also said that another IAEA verification mission was due in Iran shortly and that he had only in mid-January sent extra questions to Iran based on what diplomats called newly released intelligence.

The text of the resolution, made without the results of the report, which will only be ready in March, requires ElBaradei to report to the Security Council "steps Iran needs to take to dispel suspicions about its nuclear ambitions."

The resolution states that there are serious concerns about Iran's nuclear program. It also notes, "Iran's many failures and breaches of its obligations," (to the non-proliferation treaty) and expresses "the absence of confidence that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes." 

The resolution also states that Iran is to:

* Re-establish a freeze on uranium enrichment and related activities;

* Consider whether to stop construction of a heavy water reactor that could be the source of plutonium for weapons;

* Formally ratify an agreement allowing the IAEA greater inspecting authority and continue honoring the agreement before it is ratified; and

* Give the IAEA additional power in its investigation of Iran’s nuclear program, including "access to individuals" for interviews, as well as to documentation on its black-market nuclear purchases, equipment that could be used for nuclear and non-nuclear purposes and "certain military-owned workshops" where nuclear activities could take place

The resolution calling for the referral was apparently drafted by several members states of the European Union together with the United States. Political analyst Joshua Frank claims that the US is not interested in diplomatic means of limiting Iran's possible shift towards nuclear weapons development and that the major reasons are Iran's oil supplies and plans to open an International Oil Bourse in {{w|petroeuro|petroeuros}}, which would challenge the {{w|petrodollar}}, on March 20, 2006.

The agency vote sets the stage for future action by the top U.N. body. [[Russia]] and [[China]] insisted, in casting their votes with the majority, that future votes on deliberations should wait until at least March. The outcome could include economic and political sanctions. This process of successive escalation of the tension between Iran and the Western members of the Security Council was described by {{w|Hans Blix}}, responsible for about 700 inspections for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as ''{{w|spin (public relations)|spin}} and momentum''. He was in favour of ''inducing Iran to forego enrichment'' but also recommended that the United States give a similar commitment not to attack Iran with either conventional or nuclear weapons, just as it apparently has to [[North Korea]].

27 of the 35 nations on the board voted for the referral.

Three nations that voted against the resolution: [[Cuba]], [[Syria]] and [[Venezuela]]. Five other countries [[Algeria]], [[Belarus]], [[Indonesia]], [[Libya]] and [[South Africa]], abstained. 
{{wikipediapars|weapons of mass destruction in [[w:Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|UK]], [[w:Iran and weapons of mass destruction|Iran]], [[w:Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Israel]], and [[w:Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq]]}}
Jack Straw, Foreign Secretary of the [[United Kingdom]], a {{w|nuclear weapons}} state obliged under Article VI of the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty}} to destroy its own, existing nuclear weapons, said that the IAEA vote showed "the international community's determination to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East."

===Iranian reactions===
After the decision, Iran said today that it would "immediately" begin the steps to "restart full-scale uranium enrichment" and "curtail" the powers of the IAEA inspectors.

Javad Vaeedi, deputy Iranian nuclear negotiator, said in a press conference after the vote, "After this decision, Iran has to immediately bring into force its parliamentary law to suspend voluntary implementation of (the watchdog agency's) Additional Protocol (on snap inspections) and (pursue) commercial-scale enrichment which until today was under full suspension." He also said, "this resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on legal or technical grounds."

Iran has also said that a proposed deal by [[Moscow]] to enrich Iranian uranium is dead. 

"There is no adequate reason to pursue the Russian plan," said Vaeedi. "Commercial scale uranium enrichment will be resumed in Natanz in accordance with the law passed by the parliament."

Iran had said that it will "end cooperation with IAEA", if referred to the Security Council. 

As of January 31, 2006, the Deputy Director General for Safeguards of the IAEA had reported that ''Iran has continued to facilitate access under its Safeguards Agreement as requested by the Agency, and to act as if the Additional Protocol is in force, including by providing in a timely manner the requisite declarations and access to locations.''

In a 40-page report released today, the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] special envoys on [[w:torture|torture]] reported their findings regarding the [[United States]] detention facility at [[w:Guantanamo Bay|Guantanamo Bay]] on the island of [[Cuba]]. The report concludes that certain procedures practised at the facility, and during transport to it, constitute torture. Moreover the report states that "attempts by the United States Administration to redefine 'torture' in the framework of the struggle against terrorism, in order to allow certain interrogation techniques that would not be permitted under the internationally accepted definition of torture, are of utmost concern." The report goes on to state that "the interrogation techniques authorized by the [[w:Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], particularly if used simultaneously, amount to degrading treatment in violation of article 7 of [[w:ICCPR|ICCPR]] and article 16 of the [[w:United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]]."

The report recommends that the United States bring the detainees to trial "in accordance with criminal procedure" or "release them without further delay", and that "The United States Government should close the Guantánamo Bay detention facilities without further delay." To avoid further practices amounting to "torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, discrimination on the basis of religion, and violations of the rights to health and freedom of religion" the report recommends that "In particular, all special interrogation techniques authorized by the Department of Defense should immediately be revoked."

In response to the report, White House spokesperson Scott McClellan said that the facility housed "dangerous terrorists". US officials have dismissed most of the claims as "largely without merit" and pointed out that the authors of the report never visited Guantanamo Bay, despite an invitation issued to three of the five investigators in November.

In an interview with the German weekly newspaper [[w:Die Zeit|''Die Zeit'']] the United Nation's Special Rapporteur on torture and coauthor of the report Manfred Nowak said that it was the "sole responsibility of the United States that we could not visit Guantanamo". He adds that the United States explicitly barred the UN inspectors from talking to detainees, without which proper investigations are impossible. He pointed out that the need for interviews with prisoners, in order for considering investigations to be comprehensive, "is also the position of the United States when it concerns other countries, like [[China]]".

Sports footwear companies progress towards eliminating sweatshops
{{date|February 6, 2005}}
A [[United Nations]] report has shown that sports footwear companies are making progress towards ending the use of sweatshops and are implementing more worker-friendly codes of practice than clothing companies and retailers.

The study, published by the [[International Labour Organisation]], suggests that consumer pressure is behind the changes. As a result of consumer's concerns, footwear companies have been diverting financial and human resources towards developing and implementing better codes of conduct for suppliers. Large teams have been established within companies to work toward the goal of better conditions for factory workers.

The study, based upon interviews with hundreds of managers, activists, government officials, factory workers and worker representatives and visits to companies all over the world, goes on to suggest that workers should be given more powers to oversee conditions in their places of work.

Clothing companies have been failing to make such good progress due the large number of constantly-changing suppliers they use, with the ILO study describing progress as "spotty." A major retailer may have a supply base of over 5,000 different companies, making it more difficult to establish stronger, more effective links with supply companies. They have also assigned less manpower to the task of compliance with codes of practice.

In some areas of the retail industry, there has been almost no compliance with codes of practice.

China and Russia object to the Security Council statement on Iran
{{date|March 15, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|United Nations Flag]]
[[Image:Flag of IAEA.svg|thumb|IAEA Flag]]
A draft [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] statement backed by the [[United States]], [[UK|Britain]], and [[France]] calling for a report in two weeks on Iran's compliance with demands that it suspend {{w|Enriched uranium|uranium enrichment}} was objected to by [[China]] and [[Russia]] on Tuesday. Russia and China prefer a six-week deadline and want the report to go to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], rather than to the Security Council. 

While the Security Council members agree that Iran should not be making nuclear weapons, they disagree on the course of action to take. Iran says that its nuclear program is for producing energy, but the IAEA has expressed a "lack of confidence" over Iran's intentions. Some nations in the west, including the U.S., claim that Iran's goal of nuclear energy production is a cover for nuclear bomb development.

The draft Security Council proposals cite "the conviction that continued Iranian enrichment-related activity would intensify international concern." They reiterate that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction "constitutes a threat to international peace and security." Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]], Iran's supreme leader, said the nuclear program is "irreversible," and any retreat would endanger the Islamic republic's independence. Russia and China, on the other hand, are not as skeptical of Iran. They state that tough council action could cause Iran to withdraw from the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty}} and to ban inspectors sent from the International Atomic Energy Agency. 

Following last month's IAEA board report to the Security Council, expressing lack of confidence, Iran ended its voluntary cooperation with the IAEA under the Additional Protocol and said it would start uranium enrichment and bar surprise inspections of the facilities.

United Nations General Assembly votes to establish UN Human Rights Council
{{date|March 16, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag_of_the_United_Nations.svg|thumb|right|United Nations Flag]]
Yesterday, the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly}} voted overwhelmingly to establish a United Nations {{w|United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council}} "to promote and protect fundamental rights, and deal with major human rights offenders," according to a press release.

170 countries voted for the proposed resolution and four voted against ({{w|Israel}}, the {{w|Marshall Islands}}, {{w|Palau}}, and the {{w|United States}}), with three abstentions ({{w|Belarus}}, {{w|Iran}}, and {{w|Venezuela}}). The Council will replace the {{w|Commission on Human Rights}}, which has lost credibility in past years due to politicization.

The United States objected that the resolution did not go far enough to exclude from membership in the new Council those nations which it alleges are the worst human rights abusers. 

Rodrigo Malmierca Díaz, the Cuban Ambassador, declared that a "huge discredit" had befallen the previous Commission due to the "political manipulation, hypocrisy and double standards imposed on its work by the United States and the European Union." 

The 191-member General Assembly approved the resolution, which stated "members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, fully cooperate with the Council, and be reviewed under the universal periodic review mechanism, during their term of membership."

The resolution calls for elections for the new body on May 9, 2006 and an inaugural meeting on June 19, while the Commission will be abolished on June 16.

The Council will consist of 47 members, each elected individually by a majority (96 members or more) of the General Assembly. If the Council members fail to uphold high standards of human rights, they can be suspended from the Council by a two-thirds majority of  Assembly members present at the meeting.

UN creates rapid-response fund for disasters
{{date|March 21, 2006}}

After every earthquake, flood, or other disaster, the call goes out for pledges to fund emergency relief. Then a second round of begging tries to convert those pledges into actual payments. In the meantime, some relief is delayed, and people die. Money that does eventually come may not be in proportion to the need. For example, relief funding for the 26 December 2004 [[w:tsunami|tsunami]] generally came rapidly and exceeded the amount requested, but famine relief for 3.5 million Kenyans suffering drought is now [http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=17786&Cr=Kenya&Cr1= 75% underfunded]. 

To help solve these problems, the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] this month created the Central Emergency Response Fund ([[w:CERF|CERF]]) as a rainy-day savings account, to be dipped into when urgent needs require that money be spent within days--not in several months after aid pledges start being fulfilled. The Fund is about half way to the goal of half a billion dollars in deposits, which could be spent for either natural or man-made disasters.
 
"We meet to launch a fund that is proactive rather than reactive. The CERF will provide a ready pool of resources that better empower the United Nations in funding immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of disasters," said UN Secretary-General [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] on March 9.

[[w:Jan Egeland|Jan Egeland]], the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, will manage the Fund. "We are working on the two first allocations from the CERF...One is to the Horn of Africa and Kenya drought, the other one is to Cote d'Ivoire where humanitarian work and the civilian population is suffering so much," he said. "Too often, aid resembles a lottery in which a few win but most lose based on considerations other than need. We must move from lottery to predictability so all those who suffer receive aid."

The biggest donations paid so far are $41 million from Sweden and $30 million from Norway. The largest pledges are $70 million from the United Kingdom and $24 million from the Netherlands.

UN inaugurates rapid-response fund for future disasters
{{date|March 21, 2006}}

After every earthquake, flood, or other disaster, the call goes out for pledges to fund emergency relief. Then a second round of begging tries to convert those pledges into actual payments.

Sex-for-aid spreads in war-torn Liberia
{{date| May 8, 2006}}

[[Image:Liberia-Pos.png|right|thumb|150px|Location of Liberia]]
The aid agency [[w:Save the Children|Save the Children]] says an alarming number of girls in [[w:Liberia|Liberia]], as young as eight, were having sex with [[w:UN peacekeepers|UN peacekeepers]], policemen, teachers and humanitarian aid workers in exchange for money, food or favours.

"People don't really accept it but because of the financial constraints, people just have to do so. Most of them are in households headed by only the mother, catering for children. Their fathers got killed in the war, or some fathers are living but can't afford to care for their children; they have to accept the situation, so there is no way out. " 

The report says most people cited lack of economic and livelihood opportunities, as well as chronic poverty, as underlying causes for the ongoing exploitation of children. Parents reported feeling powerless to stop children who were having sex in exchange for goods and services, as they did not have the economic means to provide for their children. In some instances, families cited that transactional sex was a means of supporting the wider family to access things such as food or money to purchase food. In other cases, children identified more personal needs such as clothing or being able to access video clubs to watch films. The widespread nature of the problem meant it affected children in a broad cross section of environments. 

The study, conducted by [[w:Save the Children|Save the Children]], was intended to explore the ways in which children in 'Internally Displaced Person' (IDP) camps are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse as they attempt to meet their basic and other needs. It also explored the roles and responsibilities of humanitarian agencies in providing more protective systems for the delivery of assistance. During the discussions in the field, 315 men, women and children were consulted.

The people of Liberia have experienced ongoing suffering over the past two decades as a result of war and displacement. Children have been drawn into this in many ways, such as recruitment into armed forces, separation from their families, witnessing atrocities, rape and torture. Thousands have been driven from their homes into exile in neighbouring countries or camps for IDPs within Liberia, the report says.

Liberia has been shattered by the 1989-2003 civil war which caused an estimated 250,000 deaths in a country of barely 3 million people. The war forced around 1.3 million people from their homes into camps around the capital [[w:Monrovia|Monrovia]] or abroad.

Elections late last year saw Harvard-trained former World Bank economist [[w:Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf|Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf]] elected as the new president. Her government faces a massive task in rebuilding an economy and society torn apart by years of bloodshed. Many Liberians have been, and continue to be, heavily reliant on humanitarian assistance as a means of survival. Those who are able to find work often still live in chronic poverty with the national average wage being only US$50 per month.

The report found that people unanimously agree that attitudes have fundamentally changed since the war.

“It is like the cultural tradition is not holding any more. People have lost the cultural values and the tradition has been broken down. ” 

Most people said that children were not involved in prostitution before the war, or to a very small extent, and that this only happened in the cities but not in the villages.

Bush announces food aid to Darfur, AU faces fund crisis
{{date|May 9, 2006}}

President [[w:George W Bush|George W Bush]] has announced US emergency food shipments to [[w:Darfur|Darfur]], a province of [[w:Sudan|Sudan]]. He has asked Congress to approve $225m in aid. Sudan and the biggest rebel group signed a peace deal last Friday to end the  three year old civil war, claiming more than 200,000 lives. 

[[w:Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice]], US secretary of state will address the UN Security Council to help speed up the deployment of UN peacekeepers to the  Darfur region. 

"She's going to request a resolution that will accelerate the deployment of UN peacekeepers into Darfur," President Bush said. "We're now working with the [[w:UN|UN]] to identify countries that contribute those troops, so the peacekeeping effort will be robust." 

The Government of Sudan had previously denied UN deployment. But, after the signing of the peace treaty, they have expressed their keenness on the deployment of UN peacekeepers.

== AU lacks fund ==

So far, there are around 7,000 [[w:African Union|African Union]] peacekeepers in Darfur, but they have failed to play any significant role to control the violence in the region. They are facing a serious shortage of funds and man-power. It had been two months since any soldier in the peacekeeping forces were paid, [[w:Nigeria|Nigeria]]n envoy to the African Union confirmed yesterday.

Ambassador Sam Ibok, Nigerian envoy to the AU said, "There have been some cash flow problems, but that has been resolved now and troops will be paid in the next week or so. "

== Chad welcomes treaty ==

[[w:Chad|Chad]], Sudan's neighbouring state, welcomed the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement between the Sudanese government and the main faction of the rebel [[w:Sudan Liberation Movement|Sudan Liberation Movement]]. Chad broke off diplomatic relations with Sudan on 14 April, a day after an attack on [[w:N’Djamena|N’Djamena]] by rebel forces from Sudan. Also, Chad withdrew its delegation from African Union-brokered peace talks for Sudan’s troubled western Darfur region citing Sudanese aggression. Currently, there are more than 200,000 Darfur refugees. 

Foreign minister Ahmat Allami said, "Chad welcomes the signing of the Abuja peace deal on Darfur between the warring Sudanese parties after a long period of negotiations."

[[w:Libya|Libya]] announced today that it would resume effort to normalize bilateral relations between Chad and Sudan. A Libyan official said a tripartite summit would be held soon.

China enters UN human rights council
{{date|May 9, 2006}}

The [[UN]] [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] elected the [[UN]] {{w|UN Human Rights council|Human Rights council}} by secret ballot on May 9, 2006. With the participation of 191 member countries and all votes valid, the assembly elected 44 of the 47-strong membership of the new council, practically putting an end to months of thorny debates. Three seats from Eastern Europe will be elected on Wednesday. Sixty-seven states stood for election.

India emerged as the top vote-getter in Tuesday's elections, winning 173 out of 191 votes in a secret ballot to elect the 47-member Council. It was the biggest tally for any country, surpassing Japan (158) and China (146) in Asia.

{{w|India}}, {{w|Indonesia}}, {{w|Bangladesh}}, {{w|Japan}}, {{w|Malaysia}}, {{w|Pakistan}}, {{w|South Korea}}, {{w|China}}, {{w|Jordan}}, {{w|Philippines}}, {{w|Bahrain}}, {{w|Saudi Arabia}}, and {{w|Sri Lanka}} are included in the Asian Group.

{{w|Argentina}}, {{w|Brazil}}, {{w|Cuba}}, {{w|Ecuador}}, {{w|Guatemala}}, {{w|Mexico}}, {{w|Peru}}, and {{w|Uruguay}} were elected for Latin America and the Caribbean Group. 

{{w|Ghana}}, {{w|Zambia}}, {{w|Senegal}}, {{w|South Africa}}, {{w|Mali}}, {{w|Mauritius|Maurice Islands}}, {{w|Morocco}}, {{w|Gabon}}, {{w|Djibouti}}, {{w|Cameroon}}, {{w|Tunisia}}, {{w|Nigeria}}, and {{w|Algeria}} comprise the African Group.

The Western European and Other Groups include {{w|Germany}}, {{w|France}}, {{w|UK|Great Britain}}, {{w|Switzerland}}, {{w|Netherlands}}, {{w|Finland}}, and {{w|Canada}}.

All groups were completed but that of Eastern Europe, which only selected three of six seats: {{w|Russia}}, {{w|Poland}}, and {{w|Czech Republic}}. Another voting round will be held to elect the remaining three seats 

The {{w|United States}} initially opposed this Council and declined to run for a seat citing inadequate correctives. A US State Department spokesperson criticizes the records of  new Council members Cuba, China, Russian and Saudi Arabia, hinting that they do not merit being on the Council. US Ambassador [[John R. Bolton]] has said the US would work with other member states "to make the council as strong and effective as it can be."

The creation of the Human Rights Council is seen as a key component of overall reform of the United Nations. The new Human Rights Council replaces the 60-year old, largely discredited Human Rights Commission. The Commission was disbanded after a number of countries with dubious human right records manipulated elections to win seats and began to work together as a bloc to defeat resolutions critical against any one of them. 

The new Council will be required to conduct a regular review of the human rights record of all countries beginning with those serving on it. The Council will have its first sitting in Geneva on June 19.

Cholera outbreak hits Angola
{{date|May 18, 2006}}
[[Image:LocationAngola.png|thumb|right|Angola, Africa]]
A [[w:cholera|cholera]] epidemic in [[w:Angola|Angola]] has killed over 1,200 people in the past three months. The UN [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO) says about 35,000 people have fallen ill, half the victims in the capital of Luanda, where the first cases were detected in February. 

The UN say the epidemic is Angola’s worst cholera outbreak in almost two decades continues to rage on with 546 new cases and 31 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. A third of the victims are children under 5.

The medical charity Mangola, Medecines Sans Frontieres and the World Health Organisation say it is the worst outbreak recorded in the country. Spokesman for Medecines Sans Frontiere Richard Veerman said: "Angola is heading for its worst ever outbreak and the situation remains very bad in Angola," he said. 

"It's very worrying, the official number of deaths countrywide is now more than 1,200, which is likely under-reported. Many people will be at home and die at home and have no possibility to come to one of our treatment centres."

Cholera, an acute intestinal disease caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, causes copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment, including rehydration, is not given promptly.

UN: Guantanamo Bay should be closed
{{date|May 19, 2006}}

[[File:Camp x-ray detainees.jpg|thumb|File image of detainees upon arrival at [[w:Camp X-Ray|Camp X-Ray]], January 2002]]

The [[United Nations]] Committee against Torture told the [[United States]] today that the US should close its detention facility at [[w:Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]] as well as disclose the existence of any secret prisons it operates. 

The committee, made up of 10 independent experts has urged the [[w:Bush administration|Bush administration]] to put a stop to the use of torture or cruel treatment during the interrogation of terror suspects.

In an 11-page report, the committee said that the US should not detain anyone in a secret facility under its control. The committee also said that the US should disclose and investigate any such facilities. It is alleged that the US has a number of secret prisons where suspects are transported to and questioned using techniques that violate international human rights conventions.

Earlier this month, the US sent 30 officials to a torture committee hearing in [[Geneva]]. The delegation was criticized for failing to comment on questions relating to America's alleged secret prisons.

The committee ruled that there was evidence that US military personnel in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] had violated the rights of some detainees. The committee said that some of the US' techniques had resulted in the deaths of prisoners during the interrogation process. The committee further claimed that "vague" guidelines had led to abuse of detainees.

According to the ''Associated Press'', John B. Bellinger III, a State Department legal advisor and participant during the hearings at Geneva, said of the recommendation to close the base that, "one, seems to be beyond their mandate; two, legally wrong to say that the existence of Guantanamo is a per se violation of the convention; and, three, a not very practical recommendation given that they say that it ought to be closed but that individuals can't be sent back to a large number of countries."

President Bush said previously on ARD German television that he wants to close the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp. According to White House spokesman Tony Snow, the President is waiting for the US Supreme Court to decide on the issue of whether military tribunals or civilian courts would try the detainees.

Riot at Guantanamo Bay detention camp
{{date|May 20, 2006}}
[[Image:Guantanamo030228-N-4936C-096.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A detainee is escorted to a medium security facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]]
Inmates at [[w:Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp|Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in [[Cuba]] have attacked guards with fan blades and other makeshift weapons. Rear Admiral Harry Harris, the commander of [[w:Joint_Task_Force_Guantanamo|Joint Task Force Guantanamo]] says some detainees were injured in "the most violent outbreak" at the facility since it was opened in 2002.

Officers fired rubber bullets at the detainees after the guards were attacked with "broken light fixtures, fan blades" and other improvised weapons. Rear Admiral Harris says, "minimum force was used to quell the disturbance".

The [[w:New York Times|New York Times]] reports that a riot-control unit with batons and shields quelled Thursday’s disturbance. Another episode involved two other groups of inmates who tore apart their quarters and attacked guards.

Military officials said the detainees' actions were designed to draw attention to the plight of the terror suspects detained indefinitely in "Gitmo". Rear Admiral Harris, said that a prisoner was pretending to hang himself to lure the guards into the room. "The detainees had slickened the floor of their block with faeces, urine and soapy water in an attempt to trick the guards," he said. "They then assaulted the guards with broken light fixtures, fan blades and bits of metal."

The guards used pepper spray and blasted the detainees with several shots from a shotgun, firing rubber balls during the five-minute fight. No guards were hurt, but six inmates were treated for "minor injuries," he said.

Colonel Mike Bumgarner said guards shot five rounds of [[w:Rubber_bullet|"nonlethal"]] pellets from a 12-gauge shotgun, and a rubber grenade from an M-203 launcher. He said rioting then broke out in two other blocks of Camp Four when around 50 detainees damaged their quarters and made weapons to attack the guards. Colonel Bumgarner said it took an hour to bring the disturbances under control. He says the six detainees received minor injuries.

A military spokesman said 60 of the detainees were later transferred to more secure areas of the camp. Colonel Bumgarner says "detainees were jumping out of the beds on top of the guards" and some guards were knocked to the floor. "Frankly we were losing the fight at that point," he said.  "This illustrates to me the dangerous nature of the men we have detained here," Rear Admiral Harris told reporters in a teleconference.
[[Image:M203_1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|M203 grenade launcher]]
Earlier in the day, two other detainees attempted suicide by overdosing on hoarded prescription drugs. Guantanamo officials said there have been 41 suicide attempts by 25 detainees and no deaths since the camp opened in January 2002. Defense lawyers contend the figure is higher.

Meanwhile, the [[w:United Nations Committee Against Torture|United Nations Committee Against Torture]] has called on the [[United States]] to shut down Guantanamo and close any other "secret prisons" it operates. The UN declared the indefinite detention of suspects without charge a "violation of the UN Convention Against Torture."

"The State party should cease to detain any person at Guantanamo Bay and close this detention facility, permit access by the detainees to judicial process or release them as soon as possible," the committee said. They called on the US to "ensure that no one is detained in any secret detention facility under its de facto effective control".

Chief of World Health Organization dies
{{date|May 22, 2006}}
[[Image:Jwleeofficial.jpg|right|200px]]
The head of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), [[w:Lee Jong-wook|Doctor Lee Jong-wook]], 61, has died after doctors performed brain surgery on him to relieve a blood clot.

"I am sorry to tell you that Dr Lee Jong-wook, director-general of the WHO, died this morning. [This is a] very sad bit of news" and Lee "was an exceptional person and an exceptional director-general. Under his leadership, the WHO has been strengthened and has been able to give an effective response to world (health) problems," said Elena Salgado, [[Spain]]'s Health Minister in a statement during the organization's 192-nation annual assembly held in [[Geneva]]. The panel observed two minutes of silence to honor Lee.

Lee was rushed to Cantonal Hospital in Geneva when he felt sick on Saturday. He became sick while he was at an official meeting. Doctors then determined that he had a blood clot in his brain and operated on Lee immediately.

"He had been in hospital since Saturday afternoon, where he underwent surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain (a subdural hematoma). He remained in intensive care. At 07:43 this morning, he was declared dead," said a statement by the WHO on its website.

"All of the staff of the World Health Organization extend their most sincere condolences to Dr Lee's family. The sudden loss of our leader, colleague and friend, is devastating," continued the statement.

"The world has lost a great man today. LEE Jong-wook was a man of conviction and passion. He was a strong voice for the right of every man, woman and child to health prevention and care, and advocated on behalf of the very poorest people," said [[Kofi Annan]], the United Nations Secretary General.

Lee became head of the WHO in 2003 and leaves behind his son, wife and two brothers.

United Nations Report: Deserts threatened by global warming
{{date|June 5, 2006}}
[[Image:Libyan Dessert.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Libyan Desert: The world's deserts are under threat, says UNEP.]]
A new report, titled "Global Deserts Outlook," has been released on [[w:World Environment Day|World Environment Day]] by the [[w:United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)]]. The report suggests that the world's deserts face dramatic changes as a result of global [[w:Climate change|climate change]]: high water demands, tourism and salt contamination of irrigated soils. Desert margins and mountainous areas within deserts that have been important for people, wildlife and water supplies for millennia, are under particular threat, say UNEP.

2006 is the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]' International Year of [[w:Desert|Deserts]] and [[w:Desertification|Desertification]]. Yet deserts could become the "carbon-free power houses of the 21st century," some experts believe. They argue an area 800 by 800 km of desert, such as the [[w:Sahara|Sahara]], could capture the solar energy to generate all the world's electricity needs - and more. 

The report, prepared by experts from across the globe, flags options that may help governments and relevant bodies deliver a more sustainable future for the Earth's desert regions.

"There are many popular and sometimes misplaced views of deserts which this report either confirms or overturns. Far from being barren wastelands, they emerge as biologically, economically and culturally dynamic while being increasingly subject to the impacts and pressures of the modern world," said Shafqat Kakakhel, UNEP's Officer in Charge and Deputy Executive Director. 

"If the huge, solar-power potential of deserts can be economically harnessed the world has a future free from fossil fuels. And tourism based around desert nature can, if sensitively managed, deliver new prospects and perspectives for people in some of the poorest parts of the world," said Mr Kakakhel.

Almost one-quarter of the earth's land surface – some 33.7 million square kilometres – has been defined as "desert" in some sense. These deserts are inhabited by over 500 million people, significantly more than previously thought. In many parts of the world desert cores remain pristine, representing some of the planet's "last remaining areas of total wilderness," stated the UNEP in a news release.

Desert species are on the brink of extinction the Global Deserts Outlook reports. At risk animals include various species of [[w:Gazelle|Gazelle]], [[w:Oryx|Oryx]], [[w:Addax|Addax]], Arabian [[w:Tahr|Tahr]] and the [[w:Barbary sheep|Barbary sheep]] as well as one of the falconers favourite prey, the [[w:Houbara bustard|Houbara]]. "At greatest risk are the few patches of dry woodlands associated with desert mountain habitats which may decline by up to 3.5 per cent per year," said the study.

As a result of their valuable water supplies being diverted to domestic or agricultural use, desert wetlands, fed by the large rivers crossing deserts, are probably the most threatened ecosystem. Probable impacts include those created by roads, settlement expansion and other infrastructure developments around areas of desert montane. By 2050 the report estimates that  desert wilderness - those areas where there are no nearby roads - will decline from just under 60 per cent of the current total desert area to just over 30 per cent.

The pharmaceutical potential of desert plants has yet to be tapped, suggests the report. Scientists across the globe are analysing many desert plants for potential medicinal compounds - including anti-cancer and anti-malarial substances, antioxidants, as well as appetite suppressants.

==Impact of climate change==
[[Image:Wikinews tag globalwarming.png|right|150px]]
The [[w:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]], who advise governments and the United Nations, have reported that temperatures in deserts could rise by an average of as much as five to seven degrees by 2100. The problem, UNEP say, will almost certainly be compounded by the melting of glaciers - whose waters sustain many deserts. 

The impacts of climate change include the transformation of semi-arid rangelands into deserts, UNEP reports. They say water supplies are under threat from salinization and pollution by pesticides and herbicides, and that rising water tables beneath irrigated soils has led to more salinization of soils.

In some coastal areas ground-water supplies have been contaminated as seawater invades subsurface waters, the report shows. Large rivers that run through deserts have supported desert people for millennia, but many have been dammed, with water loss downstream having led to serious impacts on flood plains and river ecology.

Denunciations of Scandals Threaten UN
{{date|April 19, 2005}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|right|300px]]
Denunciations of corruption, bribe, collection of bribes from refugees [http://www.estadao.com.br/agestado/noticias/2002/jan/25/114.htm] and of sexual scandal involving the peacekeepers [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1413501,00.html], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4379971.stm] threaten the Organization of the United Nations (UN).

The gravest denunciations involve the aid project to [[w:Iraq|Iraq]], called [[w:Oil for Food|Oil-for-Food]].  Grave denunciations of bribe exist, superfluous accounting and collaboration with the ex-dictator [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]], against staff of the UN, companies and politicians of several countries.  Even the secretary of the UN, [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] was suspicious of participation in the plan of corruption.  And also grave doubts still hover about his son, Kojo Annan.

The gravity of the denunciations threatens not only the credibility of the UN, but its existence.

Secretary Kofi Annan said that he is going to promote reforms in the organization.  [http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-03-24-voa7.cfm]

==The Oil-for-Food Program==
[[Image:Rice on a plate.jpg|right|250px|thumb|
'''How Oil-for-Food should have functioned'''<br />
&mdash; Money from sales of Iraqi oil were deposited in an account, inaccessible by the government of Saddam Hussein.<br />
&mdash;Part of the money was used for invading Kuwait, another part was used to cover the expenses of coalition forces and the UN.  <br />
&mdash; The money that remained stayed available in the bill.  The government of the Iraq could use that money for buy sustenances, medicines and others property that went important for the Iraqi civil population.<br />
&mdash; The merchandise chosen by the government of Saddam should be analyzed.  If some of them went considerada as of military use, to be discarded.  Merchandise approved soon were sent for the Iraq.]]  The '''The Oil-for-Food Program''' was established by the [[w:UN|Organization of the United Nations]] in 1996 for permit that the [[w:Iraq|Iraq]] sold oil for the world market in change of food, medicines and others humane worthy supplies.  

The declared intention of the program was to help the Iraqi government guarantee the basic needs of the common Iraqi citizens, injured by imposed, international economic sanctions to the government in the mat of the first one [[w:Gulf War|Gulf War]], after the Iraq invaded the Kuwait in August of 1990, however, without permission that the country reconstructed its military forces.  

The Iraq refused the program in the beginning but afterwards signed a memo in May of 1996 for its implementation.  It programs him By By began in October of 1997, and the first delivers arrived in March of 1998.  

It programs By By used a trustee deposit system, by which the money of the sale of the oil of the Iraq I to be paid by the buyer in a not accessible bill straightly by the Iraqi government.  Of this money, a part served for pay indenizações by mischief caused to the [[w:Kuwait|Kuwait]], and another one breaks era for help in the payment of the expense of the forces of the coalition and others expense of the United Nation with the Iraq.  The remaining money remained in the bill.  

The Iraqi government had permission of buy merchandise that were not prohibited by the program and debit the corresponding values of that bill.

Most of the itens, inclusive simple things as pencil and acid fólico, to be investigated, in a trial that typically led around six months, before of him I am going to be permitted.  The itens considerados as subject to application in biological, chemical weapons, and nuclear, as well as itens whose delivers to would lead a long time, were refused, does not import to justificativa given for her requests.

[[Image:Chirac ABr62200.jpeg|200px|right|thumb|French President Jacques Chirac, who was also involved in the scandal]]
Approximately 60 percent of the 26 millions of inhabitants of the Iraq depended only of the feeds of sustenance of him programs By By.  Provisions in the value moved closer to $27 billion destined for humane help were entregues to the Iraq.  

More of OR$65 billions in Iraqi oil were sold in the world market.  Around US$46 billions were used for guarantee the humane needs of the Iraqis, with food, medicines and others itens of humane help.  A total of 25 percent, from December of 2000, was spent with the repairs by the War of the Gulf by means of a bottom of compensation; 2,2 percent were operational and administrative expense of the United Nations with the program; and 0.8 percent were expense with the weapons inspection program.  

A short while before of the United States of the America and the British forces will invade the Iraq, the Secretary of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, suspended the program and evacuated more of 300 staffs that controlled the distribution of the provisions.  

In the day 28 of March of 2003, the Secretary Annan, the United States of the America, and the Great Britain asked to the [[w:Conselho of Security of the Security United|Advice Nations of the United Nations]] for assure that approximately US$10 billions in merchandise for the Iraq, that already had been ordered and approved, including US$2,4 billions in food, could be introduced in the country when the conditions permitted.  Others US$2,1 millions would be left for cover other needs of emergency of the civil Iraqis.  

The authorities of the UN estimate that 350 thousand refugees would be benefited, with property that would go since tents for shelter, to sustenances.  The resolution in argument cleared that the main responsibility by the humane consequences of the war would fall under the United States of the America and Great Britain, case they took the control of the country, second the Wednesday Convention of Genebra of 1949, about the responsibilities of the forces of occupation.  

The program formally enclosed his activities in 21 of November of 2003, and most of the deep was put under the control of the Coalition of Provisional Authority.  

Many they supported the program of intentions alegadamente humane, in the hope of that he of fact helped the Iraqis.  Some other persons criticked the program, in private after the fall of the regimen of Saddam Hussein, under the argument of that Saddam took advantage of the profits obtained by the sale of oil for maintain itself através of a plan of corruption that implicava staffs of several governments and of the UN.  

[[w:France|France]], [[w:Russia|Russia]] and [[w:China|China]] defended the expansion of the program.

==Reclamações==

Entre as orientações do programa,  estava uma que dizia que as receitas da venda do petróleo deveriam ser divididas de modo a proteger as regiões predominantemente curdas do Iraque.  Contudo, os [[w:Curdistão|curdos]] queixaram-se, desde a data de início do programa,  de que  eles não recebiam essas receitas adequadamente.

Houve  alegações de que o escritório no Cairo da [[w:Organização Mundial da Saúde|Organização Mundial da Saúde]], foi dirigido por um indivíduo que supostamente recebeu contratos de venda de petróleo, para em troca,   paralisar a construção de um novo hospital geral para a cidade curda de Sulaymaniyah, embora  os fundos para a construção desse hospital estivessem disponíveis desde 1988.

A partir de  Abril de 2004 [http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_04_25.php#002900], o programa começou a ser  alvo de acusações dos círculos conservadores norte-americanos, de que parte do dinheiro era ilegalmente desviada para o governo iraquiano. Foram feitas acusações de que parte do dinheiro era usada para subornar funcionários da ONU e até mesmo o secretário-geral Kofi Annan.

Segundo o relatório liberado no dia 3 de Fevereiro de 2005, pela comissão de investigação liderada por  Paul Volckers , o ex-presidente do Fed, Banco Central dos EUA, a maior parte dos alimentos fornecidos pelo programa "era inadequada para o consumo humano". Peter van Walsum, atualmente embaixador aposentado dos [[w:Países Baixos|Países Baixos]] para as Nações Unidas e  presidente do comitê de sanções do Iraque 1999-2000, especulou num livro recente que o Iraque deliberadamente dividiu o conselho de segurança concedendo contratos à França, [[w:Rússia|Rússia]], e  [[w:China|China]],  mas não ao [[w:Reino Unido|Reino Unido]] e aos Estados Unidos da América. Ele também afirmou que ele encontrou um número de casos nos quais sentia  que a falta da cooperação iraquiana tinha o objetivo propositado de exacerbar o sofrimento da sua própria gente. Ele também disse que,  em  sua opinião,  as sanções não eram uma alternativa  eficaz.

Benon Sevan, do [[w:Chipre|Chipre]], comandou o programa Petróleo-por-comida, e com convicção o defendeu. Ele  disse que  o programa teve só um custo administrativo de 2,2 %,  que passou por mais de 100 revisões (internas e externas), e culpou as restrições do Conselho de Segurança por ter dificultado a situação. Ele também disse que 90 % da população de Iraque confiava no programa de entrega mensal da cesta de  alimentos.

==Al-Mada==
[[Image:Al-Mada-Map-World.png|350px|right|thumb|Native countries of the institutions and individuals cited in Al-Mada (in green).]]
On January 25, 2004, ''Al-Mada'', a daily newspaper of the Iraq, published a [http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&Area=ia&ID=IA16404 list of 270 individuals and organizations] of several countries that would have received contracts of sale of oil by intermediary of the Oil-for-Food Program of the UN.  The list based itself in more of 15,000 documents that supposedly were found in the corporation of Iraqi state-owned oil, to which had connections with the Department of the Oil of Iraq.  

The Department of the Oil headed by ally Ahmed Chalabi, ex-member of the advice of government, that had been in the past widely critiqued until by his ex-apoiadores, by supply to the U.S.A. false information during the war.  The possible envolvement of Chalabi and to not possibility of corroborate the evidences put in doubt the accuracy of the list al-Mada.  

In the list of beneficiários of the al-Mada were the member of the British parliament, George Galloway, and to his entity of charity, the Bottom of Mariam; the ex-minister of the French interior Charles Pasqua, and the sheikh al-Kaffaji, a man of Iraqi business, that contributed with OR$400 thousand for produce a film that discredited the researches of weapons for the ex-inspecting one of the UN Scott.  Many Russian firms and important individuals also were included in the list of the al-Mada.  To even the Russian Orthodox Church was supposedly implicada in the illegal commerce of oil.  George Galloway subsequently earned two actions of defamation against the Christian Science Monitor and the Daily Telegraph that reportaram the accusations.  Of Brazil, there were two names in the list.  The first one of them was the name of a such of Fuad Sirhan, and another name was supposedly of some organization called Movement 8 of October (Chávez).  Nobody of Portugal appears in the list.  

They appear in the list the names of the chief executive (I DINE), Patrick Maugein, of the company I Punch International, that supposedly is enough connected to the French president [[w:Jacques Chirac|Jacques Chirac]]; of the French ex-ambassador for the UN, Jean-Bernard; and the name president of the Indonesia Megawati Sukarnoputri.  

In an interview for the Financial Teams, the sheikh al-Kaffaji, that appears in the list, admitted that received and sold contratos of Iraqi oil for the Italtech, a company of Italian oil-producing commerce, that by his time resold the oil for the company Bayoil, that stayed in Houston, in the U.S.A.  Khafaji said that the ex-inspecting one of the UN Scott Ritter swims to know about those activities.  

Arthur Millholland, the president of the Oilexco Ltd, whose name also appeared in the list of Al-Mada denied any envolvement in illicit activities, but admitted the accusations of that illegal surcharges were payment to the Iraqi government by contractors.  [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040423/ROIL23/TPBusiness/TopStories] 

Of any form, the list of al-Mada does not mention exactly the payment of bribes to the government of the Iraq.  She quotes paid bribes to individuals for that these supported the Iraqi regimen.  Few they deny that in the Iraq, as in many countries of third world, bribes regularly are paid the leaderships for acquire contracts.  But some they suggest that you have bribes normally would not occur in you have countries when a program in execution of the UN was involved.

==Funcionanento do esquema de corrupção==
[[Image:Iraq-oil-power.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Oil refinery in Iraq]]
Algumas companhias superfaturavam em até 10% as contas,  e parte do dinheiro era desviada para as contas bancárias privadas de Saddam Hussein ou outros funcionários do regime.  Parte do dinheiro ficava com as próprias companhias.

Segundo se alega, o esquema de corrupção funcionava assim:
# os contratos de petróleo  pelo programa Petróleo-por-comida eram oferecidos somente a indivíduos e organizações simpáticas ao regime iraquiano, ou somente  para aqueles que poderiam ser facilmente subornados. 
# os contratos então eram  vendidos no mercado mundial  e  o vendedor podia ficar com  uma taxa da transação da venda do petróleo,  algo em torno de 0,15 a 0,50 de dólares por barril (0,94 a 3,14 dólares por metro cúbico),  segundo se calcula. 
# em seguida, o vendedor  reembolsava o governo iraquiano com uma porcentagem de comissão.

Estimativas mostram que Saddam Hussein usou o programa da ONU para juntar 21 bilhões de dólares a fim de subornar políticos estrangeiros para apoiar decisões contrárias aos EUA e financiar organizações terroristas. Pelo menos 74 milhões de dólares do programa Petróleo-por-comida foram direto para o [[w:Hamas|Hamas]]. Há suspeitas de que parte do dinheiro tenha ido para a organização [[w:Al Qaeda|Al Qaeda]]. [http://www.forward.com/issues/2003/03.06.20/news2.html]

Em  Fevereiro,  depois que o nome de Benon Sevan, o diretor executivo do programa de Petróleo-por-comida, apareceu nos documentos do Ministério de Petróleo do Iraque, tornou-se evidente o possível envolvimento das Nações Unidas no caso. 

Supõe-se que  Sevan tenha recebido em propinas  pelo menos 11 000 000 de barris (1 700 000 m ³) de petróleo. Em dinheiro isto corresponde a cerca de 3.5 bilhões de dólares. Benon Sevan negou as acusações.

== As investigações==

Em 2000, Dileep Nair, vice-secretário-geral e diretor do gabinete que investiga os casos de ilegalidades na ONU, desejou determinar a vulnerabilidade do programa. Benon Sevan,  chefe do programa Petróleo-por-comida,  e  a subsecretária-geral   Louise Frechette rejeitaram toda e qualquer investigação sob a alegação de que ela seria muito cara e que não valeria a pena.

Enquanto Benon Sevan esteve na chefia do Petróleo-por-comida,  ele rejeitou os esforços para rever e investigar o programa.
Ele rencomendou o seu pessoal que as reclamações sobre pagamentos ilegais deviam ser formalmente arquivadas com o país do reclamente,  e que devia ser permitido  ao Iraque  barrar qualquer denúncia.

===Investigation of Charles Duelfer for the Central Intelligence Agency===
[[Image:Charles Duelfer.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Charles Duelfer testifies before Congress about the corruption of the Oil-for-Food Program]]  On September 30, 2004, the report of special counselor Charles Duelfer of the Central Intelligence Agency ([[w:CIA|CIA]]), was released.  The report described the impact of the Oil-for-Food Program on the regime of Saddam Hussein:

:''The introduction of the Oil-for-Food Program in 1996 was key step in the turnaround of the regime.  It rescued the economy of Baghdad of a decline terminal created by the sanctions.  The regime quickly perceived that the program would be able to to be corrupted in order to acquire change foreigner so much for mine the sanctions, as much as for supply the meanses for improve to infrastructure of double utility and the development of potential weapons of mass destruction in batter.''  [volume I, page 1]

Second the report of Charles Duelfer, Saddam received an estimated of $1.7 billion, outside of the control of the UN, between 1997 and 2003.  Duelfer also said it's possible that Benon Sevan has received bribes of the plan with the oil.

===GAO Investigation===
After the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the victory of the Coalition over the Iraqi army, The General Accounting Office (GAO) &mdash; General Office of American Accounting &mdash; had the task of finalize all the contratos related upon programming By By, after the fall of the Iraqi regimen.  Was responsibility of him also track the fortunes of all of the ex members of the government of the Iraq [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04651t.pdf].  During this task, the General Office found you fail in the program that permitted the existence of bribes and other forms of help for Saddam Hussein.  He calculates that the regimen of Saddam Hussein generated $10.1 billion in illegal prescriptions.  This number I included $5.7 billion of contrabando of oil and $4.4 billion in illicit surcharges about sales of oil and shipments powders-sell about fornecedores.  

More latter to scale of the fraud revealed be been much more extensive than the General Office of American Accounting intially had calculated.  A study of Department of the Defense of the U.S.A., cited by the General Office, evaluated 759 contratos administered by the Oil-for-Food program and concluded that barely half had been fabricated, by a margin of 21 percent [http://www.gao.gov/highlights/d04579thigh.pdf].  

It can be well-read in the summary of the report of the General Office of American Accounting: :''Tanto the secretary of the UN, através of the office of the as much as Iraqi program the Advice of Security, através of his committee of sanctions to the Iraq, were responsible by supervise programs him By By.  However, the Iraqi government negotiated straightly contratos with buyers of Iraqi oil and fornecedores of commodities, what may have been an important factor that permitted to the Iraq charge illegal surcharges and commissions.''  

Before of staffs of the United Nations will have promised full cooperation with the inquiry from the of the General Office of American Accounting, Joseph A.  The Christoff, director of international business and commerce of the GAO, said that auditores of the UN had refused it liberate the internal audits of him programs By By [http://washingtontimes.com/world/20040429-120918-1334r.htm].  

Benon Sevan, leader of programs By By, with support of Kofi Annan, wrote letters for all of the ex contractors of programs By By asking that consulted Sevan before of liberate any documents for of the General Office of American Accounting, or panels of inquiry of the Congress of the United States of the America [http://edition.cnn.com/2004/US/05/03/un.oil.for.food.letter/].  

By all his history, the program received complaints of that he was necessary be clearer and claims of companies about revelations of private information.  

The UN denied all petitions deeds by the General Office of American Accounting for obtain access to confidential internal audits of him programs By By.  

While tried to decide to complexity of the Oil-for-Food program, in an article for the periodic one The New York Teams, to journalist investigativa Claudia Rosett, of the Foundation in Defense of the Democracy ([http://www.defenddemocracy.org Foundation will go the Defense of Democracies]) and of the Institute Hudson, uncovered that details of I hire of the UN, as the identities of the contractors of programs By By, the price, the quantity and quality That were received were confidential information.  The banking extracts, the payments performed and the transactions also were maintained in secret [http://reform.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Rosett%20Testimony--%20(cleaned%20up%20version).pdf].  

"That money [of the Oil-for-Food program] was in secret, devious for you count banking illicit, outside of the Iraq and bingo: Saddam had access to the money of outside of the country, despite of the sanctions" [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,133087,00.html] , said Rosset in interview for the Foundation in Defense of the Democracy and for a collaborator of the Fox News.  

Rosett harshly was criticked by Dennis Halliday, that of 1997 to 1998 coordinated the humane help of the UN for the Iraq [http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0403/19/i_dl.01.html], and Benon Sevan [http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0305/04/i_dl.01.html].  Both they affirmed that many of the statements of Rossett were incorrect, as to that says that programs By By financed the approval of an Olympic stadium, or to that affirms that the responsibility by several questions of the program differ from resolutions of the UN.  

The House Committee on International Relations investigated the Oil-for-Food program and uncovered that between 15 million and 25 million dollars in cash of the program was used by Sabah Yassen, ex-ambassador to Iraq for [[w:Jordan|Jordan]], in order to pay the Palestinian families of suicidal terrorists.  From September of 2000 up to the invasion of the Iraq, the families of Palestinians dead or injured in the conflict with Israel (including the 117 responsible for suicidal attacks against Israel) received more of $35 millions.

=== As investigações do  conselho de governo iraquiano===
[[Image:Flag of Iraq.svg|right|200px]]
O conselho de governo iraquiano selecionou a empresa internacional de auditoria KPMG e a firma  especializada em direito de empresas internacionais Freshfield Bruckhaus Deringer  para investigar as alegações do jornal al-Mada. Ambas deveriam ter divulgado suas conclusões em Maio de 2004. Todavia, em Junho de 2004, a KPMG parou de trabalhar no projeto por falta de pagamento do conselho do governo iraquiano  [http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/003120.php].

Os Estados Unidos da América criticaram duramente a investigação da KPMG liderada por sócios de Ahmed Chalabi, e acusaram-no de sabotar a investigação principal iniciada por Paul Bremer. Aquela investigação foi liderada pelo chefe  do Conselho Supremo de Auditores Independentes do Iraque, Ehsan Karim, com a ajuda da Ernst & Young. Em Junho de 2004, a investigação de Karim concordou em compartilhar informações com a comissão montada por Volcker. Entretanto, em 1 de Julho de 2004, Karim  foi assassinado por uma bomba magnética colocada em seu carro [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3855803.stm].

Claude Hankes-Drielsma, um britânico amigo de longa-data de Ahmed Chalabi foi escolhido pelo conselho do governo iraquiano para coordenar as investigações do programa Petróleo-por-comida. Drielsma testemunhou perante o Congresso dos EUA em 21 de Abril de 2004 e disse que a investigação conduzida pela KPMG esperava provar a clara ligação entre aqueles países que estavam prontos a fornecer apoio ao regime de Saddam Hussein em troca de benefícios financeiros, às custas do povo iraquiano, e aqueles que se opuseram às aplicações das sanções contra o Iraque e deposição de Saddam. Ele também testemunho que Chalabi estava no comando das investigações para o conselho do governo iraquiano.

No final de Maio de 2004, no mesmo dia em que os escritórios de Chalabi no Congresso Nacional Iraquiano eram revistados pelas forças de coalião, Drielsma alegou que um indivíduou, ou indivíduos, entraram em seu computador e apagaram todos os arquivos relacionados com a sua investigação. Ele também disse que um arquivo de backup  havia sido apagado.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/06/06/wirq06.xml&sSheet=/news/2004/06/06/ixworld.html]

Quando a jornalista Claudia Rosette perguntou-lhe se ele tinha sofrido ameaças físicas também, Drielsma retrucou com sem comentários. Drielsma também foi um crítico ferrenho da recusa por parte da ONU em tornar pública as informações internas da auditoria do programa Petróleo-por-comida para o conselho de governo iraquiano.

===Investigação das Nações Unidas===
[[Image:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|right|250px|thumb|UN Headquarters in New York]]
No dia 19 de Março de 2004,  o secretário-geral de Nações Unidas,  Kofi Annan voltou atrás e disse que realizaria uma investigação completa sobre o Programa Petróleo-por-comida.  Numa entrevista, o secretário-geral disse: "É altamente provável que tenha havido bastante irregularidades, mas necessitamos investigar [...] e ver quem foi o  responsável". [[Image:Loudspeaker.png]] [http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/pressconference/so040319.rm?start=%2200:00:03%22   áudio] 

Annan porém acrescentou que a maioria das denúncias eram "ultrajantes e exageradas [http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/28/iraq.un.oil.reut/]. Segundo ele a maior parte  das críticas eram sobre questões  não relacionadas ao programa.

Apenas seis auditores internos  da ONU foram inicialmente designados para fiscalizar o programa Petróleo-por-comida.  As recomendações da ONU  dizem  que pelo menos 12 auditores devem trabalhar na fiscalização de programas que gastam mais de 1 bilhão de dólares, como por exemplo, o Petróleo-por-comida.  Mesmo assim, os auditores internos encontraram várias irregularidades, entre elas: a compra de 287 computadores por  870 mil dólares para os escritórios em [[w:Bagdá|Bagdá]], sendo que 100 computadores estavam a mais e não teriam uso nos escritórios; gasto considerado exorbitante de 47 mil dólares com móveis para o escritório em Bagdá, pagamento anual de 500 mil dólares para o governo iraquiano para pagar por inspetores de construções, que nunca trabalharam para a ONU; compra de seis geradores de energia elétrica a diesel, mesmo sendo difícil obter  diesel  na região o que seria a um custo de 10 milhões de dólares; foram gastos uma quantia considerada exagerada de 500 mil dólares com suprimentos de inverno, como roupas,  para a população do Iraque.[http://www.theage.com.au/news/Iraq/Oilforfood-audits-tell-of-millions-lost/2005/01/11/1105423481900.html?oneclick=true]  

Parte da auditoria interna da ONU vazou e apareceu no ''website'' mineweb.com.  O relatório que vazou mostrava grandes discrepâncias  entre os relatórios da empresa suíça Cotecna e os relatórios das agências da ONU,  quanto a valores de transportes para a região norte do Iraque.

Para a auditoria  a Cotecna não fez nenhuma inspeção "de valor" sobre quase 1 bilhão de dólares de remessas de ajuda para o Programa Humanitário da Interagência no norte iraquiano.  O responsável pelo programa,  Benon Sevan,    foi   informado das descobertas da auditoria em  Dezembro de 2002  [http://washingtontimes.com/world/20040520-121412-9548r.htm].

A auditoria está disponível [http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/un_oilforfood_audit.pdf aqui]. Seu resumo diz: 
:''A conclusão total da OIO é que a gerência do contrato não foi adequada e certos regulamentos do contrato não foram seguidos. Além do mais, a incorporação de custos adicionais, tal como reabilitação de acampamentos contados em dias-homem  foi uma disposição inaceitável. Também, o contrato  foi remendado antes de seu início, o que foi  impróprio. O OIP tem de fortalecer o seu gerenciamento de contratos e o Setor de Atividade de Suprimento deve assegurar que a base do pagamento é apropriada para evitar custos adicionais à organização.''

Depois de ler o relatório de auditoria, o congressista americano Henry Hyde escreveu para Kofi Annan e perguntou  por que "o Congresso de Estados Unidos,   responsável por  22 por cento do orçamento do ONU  e que solicitou publicamente as cópias de 55 auditorias  internas,  precisou  depender de vazamentos de meios de comunicação para ter acesso aos documentos."

Um painel independente de inquérito das Nações Unidas foi criado em abril de 2004. Foram designados para dirigir esse painel de investigação: o ex-presidente do Fed (Banco Central dos EUA)  Paul Volcker;  Richard Goldstone  da África do Sul e ex-promotor do Tribunal Internacional Criminal da ex-Iugoslávia e do Tribunal Internacional de [[w:Ruanda|Ruanda]];  e   Mark Pieth, da Suíca, especialista em finanças da ''Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development'' (OECD).

Em  22 de abril de 2004, o Conselho de Segurança de Organização das Nações Unidas passou uma resolução unânime que endossou  o inquérito de Volcker sobre corrupção no programa Petróleo-por-comida para o Iraque e pediu a colaboração dos  191 estados membros. [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/22/international/middleeast/22CND-NATI.html]

== Last reports so far ==
On a initial report of 219 pages, the commission of Volcker registers that Benon Sevan used his position to make and receive request of Iraqi oil during the years that he supervised the program<!-- de alívio humanitário -->.

Internal documents of SOMO (Iraq 's State Oil Marketing Organization) as well as interviews with Iraqi ex-employees involved in illicit selling of oil, show that Sevan had requested and had received allocations of 7.3 millions barrels of oil in the name of a company registered in Panama called African Middle East Petroleum Co.
<!--
Registros internos de SOMO (Iraq 's State Oil Marketing Organization) assim como entrevistas com ex-funcionários iraquianos envolvidos em negócios ilícitos de petróleo, mostram que Sevan tinha solicitado e tinha recebido alocações de 7.3 milhões de barris de petróleo  em nome de uma companhia de comércio registrada do Panamá chamada African Middle East Petroleum Co.
-->

Although the report does not make a specific allegation of criminal activity by Sevan, Volcher does not exclude the possibility that the accusations have been filed by authorities in countries with relevant jurisdiction.
<!--
Embora o relatório não faça nenhuma alegação específica de atividade criminal por Sevan, Volcker não exclui a possibilidade de as acusações terem sido arquivadas por autoridades em países com jurisdição relevante.
-->

O relatório chamou a conduta de Sevan "eticamente imprópria anotando que Sevan tinha recebido grandes  pagamentos à vista que totalizam 160 mil dólares por cada ano durante o qual ele tinha sido chefe  do programa. O Sevan diz que o dinheiro veio de uma tia no  Chipre morreu, mas a comissão de investigação não achou nenhuma evidência para apoiar esta afirmação.

Volcker também informou em Janeiro que uma revisão de 58 auditorias confidenciais da ONU sobre o programa  mostrou que funcionários da ONU igonoraram precocemente sinais de que as mercadorias despachadas pela companhia suíca Cotecna para o Iraque antes da invasão de 2003 foram pouco inspecionadas, se é que foram inspecionadas. A Cotecna pagou a Kojo Annan, o filho do secretário-geral da ONU,  Kofi Annan, taxas  de  consultoria, até  Novembro de 2003. Volcker disse que os futuros relatórios deveriam tratar as questões relacionadas Kojo Annan [http://www.iic-offp.org/documents/InterimReportFeb2005.pdf].

O secretário-geral da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) general Kofi Annan foi absolvido pelo relatório da comissão de Volcker,  dia 29 de Março  das acusações de que ele teria usado sua influência para conceder contratos no Iraque à companhia suíça Cotecna Inspection Services , onde trabalhava seu filho Kojo Annan.

Kofi Annan porém é questionado  por não ter investigado melhor as operações relacionadas a seu filho Kojo. E dois membros de seu pessoal, Iqbal Riza e Dileep Nair, foram criticados  no relatório da comissão Volcker. Riza alegadamente rasgou documentos relacionados aos contratos na investigação depois que o secretário-geral rencomendou que eles fossem guardados. O jornal The New York Times disse que Nair foi "fraudulento" ao indicar uma pessoa que quase não tinha experiência para um posto de grande responsabilidade do programa Petróleo-por-comida.

O filho do secretário-geral, Kojo, também foi  bastante criticado pelo relatório, que diz que ele "enganou intencionalmente o secretário-geral" sobre a sua ligação financeira com a empresa suíça. E acrescenta: "Questões significativas permanecem a respeito de Kojo e de suas ações durante o outono [boreal] de 1998, assim como da integridade de seus negócios e transações financeiras com respeito ao programa Petróleo por comida."

Kofi Annan recebeu pressões  para renunciar, todavia ele disse que não fará isso.[http://author.voanews.com/english/2005-03-29-voa66.cfm]

Dia 14 de Abril, o texano David Chalmers, proprietário da empresa  Bayoil Inc, de [[w:Hounston|Hounston]] e que participou do programa da ONU, foi preso e indiciado, acusado de ter pago milhões de dólares para o regime de Saddam Hussein e de usar dinheiro do programa Petróleo-por-comida. [http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/04/14/oilfood.indictment/]
Também foram indiciados um  búlgaro residente dos  EUA,  chamado Ludmil Dionisiev, um britânico chamado  John Irving e um  sul-coreano identificado como Tongsun Park.

Os promotores dos EUA que investigam o caso acusaram Tongsun Park de tentar influenciar autoridades da ONU. Eles dizem que Park encontrou-se com duas autoridades de elevado posto da ONU nos anos 90 e que recebeu dois milhões de dólares por seu trabalho.

Funcionários da ONU admitiram que o ex-secretário-geral Boutros Boutros-Ghali tinha uma grande amizade com Tongsun Park e que eles se encontraram por diversas vezes durante os anos noventa, que era a época em que se acertavam os detalhes do programa Petróleo-por-comida.

Um alto funcionário da ONU, Maurice Strong, admitiu que manteve relações com o sul-coreano Tongsun Park.  Strong confirmou que Tongsun Park investiu numa empresa de energia da qual Strong  fazia parte, em 1997. Todavia, Strong  disse que o investimento foi uma relação comercial normal e que não tinha nenhuma relação com o Iraque. 

Maurice Strong é um conselheiro próximo do secretário-geral da ONU  Kofi Annan. Em entrevista para a  agência de notícias VOA, Koffi Anan disse que desconhecia qualquer relacionamento financeiro entre Strong e Park.[http://author.voanews.com/english/2005-04-19-voa70.cfm]

United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions on North Korea
[[Image:LocationNorthKorea.png|right|top|250px|thumb|North Korea]]
[[Image:UN_security_council_2005.jpg|right|top|250px|thumb|UN Security Council Chamber New York]]

{{date|July 15, 2006}}

The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] has unanimously voted to impose sanctions related to weapons on [[North Korea]].

The resolution demands that North Korea 'suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program.

The resolution requires all {{w|United Nations member states|UN member states}} to prevent imports from or exports to North Korea of missiles and missile-related items as well as materials that could be used in {{w|WMD|weapons of mass destruction.}}

However, in order to keep [[China]] from vetoing the resolution, the resolution was not passed under {{w|Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter 7}} of the {{w|U.N. Charter}}, which is used on a legally binding document. However, the resolution is considered mandatory because of the way it is worded. 

China and [[Russia]] proposed a resolution with weaker language, but later agreed to this tougher resolution.

North Korean ambassador to UN {{w|Pak Kil-yon}} spoke after the vote and criticized some members of the Security Council for attempting to isolate [[North Korea]]. He also vowed that North Korea will continue with its missile testings.

Speculation grows in race to succeed Kofi Annan
{{date|August 14, 2006}}

South Korean foreign minister [[w:Ban Ki Moon|Ban Ki Moon]] and UN undersecretary [[w:Shashi Tharoor|Shashi Tharoor]] of India are the early leaders in the race to succeed [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] [[w:Secretary General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] who retires at the end of this year. 

In late July the 15 members of the [[w:United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] conducted a secret straw poll on who should succeed Annan. Monday's edition of the ''[[w:The Guardian|the Guardian]]'' newspaper reports the leaked results which have Ban leading with 12 "encourages", 1 "discourage" and 2 "no opinions" ahead of Tharoor's 10 "encourages", 2 "discourages" and 3 "no opinions". The other two official candidates thus far are Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister [[w:Surakiart Sathirathai|Surakiart Sathirathai]] and former U.N. disarmament chief [[w:Jayantha Dhanapala|Jayantha Dhanapala]] from Sri Lanka. Prime Minister [[w:Goh Chok Tong|Goh Chok Tong]] of Singapore is also a possible contender, according to ''the Guardian'' but has not officially declared his interest. 

Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] of New Zealand dismissed a report, Monday, that she was lobbying for the position calling it "a piece of fiction". The ''New Zealand Herald'' reported in its weekend edition that Clark had sought support for her possible candidacy from British Prime Minister [[w:Tony Blair|Tony Blair]] during a recent visit to London.

Coincidentally, Ban was in Auckland Monday seeking New Zealand's support for his bid. New Zealand Foreign Minister [[w:Winston Peters|Winston Peters]] met with Ban but made no public comment on his country's position on the contest. 

Traditionally, the position of Secretary-General rotates among the continents suggesting that Annan's successor will likely be an Asian, the first since [[w:U Thant|U Thant]] filled the post from 1961 to 1971.

India may pull peacekeeping troops out of Lebanon
{{date|August 24, 2006}}
{{India}}
Defence Minister [[w:Pranab Mukherjee|Pranab Mukherjee]] has said [[w:India|India]] may withdraw the 775 troops it has stationed in [[w:Lebanon|Lebanon]] as part of  the 1,990-strong [[w:United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]]. 

A new U.N force, comprising of troops from Italy, France and other nations is being organised to act as a buffer between Israeli forces and [[Hezbollah]], following the recent conflict between the two. Diplomatic sources say the withdrawal decision may have been taken because the new mandate involves ''peace-enforcement'' as opposed to ''peace-keeping''. India, which is currently the second-largest troop-contributor to U.N peacekeeping operations, will wait till the expiry of the current mandate on 31st August before handing over its positions to the new force. The contingent from the [[w:Sikh Regiment|4th Sikh Battalion]] is currently engaged in rescue and rehabilitation work following the recent weeks of conflict, in which one of its peacekeepers was critically injured by shrapnel from an Israeli shell.

Security Council backs ceasefire in Israel-Lebanon conflict
{{date|August 12, 2006}}

{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
The [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] has unanimously approved {{w|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|Resolution 1701}} calling for a "full cessation of hostilities" in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|Israeli-Lebanon war]] and for international and Lebanese troops to replace Israeli troops in south Lebanon.

The UN decree comes on the heels of an Israeli government decision to expand its offensive in Lebanon. Sources say that Israeli prime minister [[Ehud Olmert]] will bring the UN resolution to cabinet for discussion on Sunday. Daniel Ayalon, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said that his government was likely to agree to the resolution.

"I do not want to preempt the Cabinet decision, but the language as I see it now &mdash; and I'm being careful &mdash; if the language of the resolution doesn't change, I view this resolution very positively and, of course, the crux is implementation," Ayalon said. "If this resolution will be enforced, then we solve the problem of Lebanon," said the Israeli envoy.

[[Hezbollah]] officials have not responded to the UN action. The Lebanese cabinet meets Saturday to discuss the resolution.

Lebanese leaders have cautiously welcomed the resolution which had been delayed for almost a week due to negotiations over its wording. U.N. Ambassador Nouhad Mahmoud of Lebanon said; "The Lebanese are not comfortable with the Israeli distinctions of what is defensive and what is offensive." 

The resolution calls for [[Hezbollah]] to end its attacks on Israel and for Israel to end "offensive military operations" in Lebanon. It also raises the strength of the UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, the {{w|United Nations Interim Force}} (Unifil), from 2,000 to a maximum of 15,000, and gives it an expanded mandate to enforce the ceasefire. A portion of the UN language expanding that force's Chapter 6 mandate reads: ''"Acting in support of a request from the government of Lebanon to deploy an international force to assist it to exercise its authority throughout the territory, authorizes Unifil to take all necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces and as it deems within its capabilities, to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind... "''

The U.S. Secretary of State, [[Condoleezza Rice]], responding on Friday during an interview with ''{{w|CNN|CNN's}}'' {{w|Wolf Blitzer}} to the difference between a UN Chapter 7 mandate, and the current mandate for Unifil in Lebanon said: <blockquote>So this force has a big mandate, it has a robust mandate, it has a mandate that will allow it to defend itself and to defend that mandate. But it's never been the expectation that this force is going to disarm Hezbollah. That will have to be done by the Lebanese...<br><br>...Chapter 7 is very often used when a government is not prepared to accept a force. Lebanon is prepared to accept this force, but this is an absolutely robust mandate. This, by the way, is what helped the Israeli government. They were concerned earlier about the mandate. After we talked about this enhanced mandate in the revised resolution, I think the government of Israel saw that it met their needs.</blockquote>
 
Israel is to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon as UN and Lebanese troops are deployed. The resolution outlines plans for the disarmament of Hezbollah and for a settlement of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
 
The UN also called for the unconditional release by Hezbollah of two Israeli soldiers it captured on July 12th, precipitating the conflict.

123 Israelis, including 40 civilians, and 861 Lebanese, mostly civilians, have been killed in the 31-day old war.

India's Secretary-General candidate Tharoor suggests UN reform agenda
{{date|August 29, 2006}}
{{India}}
India's nominee for the post of [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] of the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]], [[w:Shashi Tharoor|Shashi Tharoor]] has revealed a four-point plan to tackle the problems the international body is facing. He said that the biggest hurdle faced by the UN is that it has to deal with a large number of issues at the same time. The United Nations with its "impressive achievements and "haunting failures has changed but needs to change further" he said in an article in ''[[w:Newsweek International|Newsweek International]]''. 

Tharoor's proposal is concentrated on four areas- making democracy a priority; bolstering the ranks (of the United Nations); prioritising and streamlining; and healing wounds. He talked about the crisis in the Middle East, and the nuclear standoff between the U.N and countries like North Korea and Iran, referring to them as "obvious and trying". He also pointed out "problems without passports" such as climate change, narcotics smuggling  and human rights violations. Tharoor, a leading candidate to succeed [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]], said that strengthening the capacities of both the UN and its member-states was the best way to deal with these problems.

Tharoor stated that further efforts were needed to promote democracy and good governance the world over. "We now have a Democracy Fund to help us do that, financed not just by the rich West but by countries like India," he said. He also pointed out that the UN should try and stand up more for human rights by making sure the [[w:Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] did its job more effectively than the "over-politicised" [[w:Human Rights Commission|Human Rights Commission]] it replaced. He said the UN should support the efforts bodies like [[w:NATO|NATO]] and the [[w:EU|EU]] were making in their peacekeeping. Tharoor also spoke about the conflict in Iraq, saying "And where the task, like enforcing peace in Iraq, is clearly beyond us (the UN), we should let wars be fought by warriors, not peacekeepers,"

In reference to "healing wounds", he pointed out the danger of the [[w:Cold War|Cold War]] divisions being replaced by a North-South divide at the UN "The new secretary-general must urgently combat this. I would focus on building issue-based coalitions to deal with specific practical problems (things like management inefficiencies, procurement policies, information technology, outsourcing) that have little to do with ideological politics," he said.

Tharoor is currently the UN's Under Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information. He and South Korean Foreign Minister [[w:Ban Ki Moon|Ban Ki Moon]] are considered frontrunners in the race to succeed Annan, whose term ends at the end of the year. Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister [[w:Surakiart Sathirathai|Surakiart Sathirathai]] and former UN disarmament chief [[w:Jayantha Dhanapala|Jayantha Dhanapala]] from Sri Lanka are also official candidates for the top UN job.

Annan: Israel violates cease-fire
{{date|August 19, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
Israel violated resolution 1701 yesterday when troops from the Matkal, a special forces elite unit, launched a commando raid near the [[Hezbollah]] stronghold of Baalbek, in the Beka valley, according to Kofi Annan. One Israeli soldier was killed and two injured. Three Hezbollah members were killed according to Lebanese security officials.

Spokesman Mark Regev defended the action, saying "Israel reserves the right to act in order to enforce the spirit of the [UN] resolution,". The resolution called for a cessation of all hostilities, and an arms embargo. The Israeli Prime minister, Ehud Olmert justified the attack, stating that it was intended to prevent the supply of new weapons and ammunition to Hezbollah.

"The Secretary-General is deeply concerned about a violation by the Israeli side of the cessation of hostilities as laid out in Security Council resolution 1701," said a UN spokesperson. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general said violations of the resolution like Israel's "endanger the fragile calm that was reached after much negotiation and undermine the authority of the Government of Lebanon." He called on all parties "to respect strictly the arms embargo, exercise maximum restraint, avoid provocative actions and display responsibility in implementing resolution 1701."

Annan demands Hezbollah free abducted soldiers and Israel lift blockade
{{date|August 31, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
[[w:United Nations|United Nations]] [[w:Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary General]] [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] called on [[w:Hezbollah|Hezbollah]], Monday, to release the two [[w:Israel|Israeli]] soldiers who were captured on July 12.

Annan also urged Israel to lift its air and sea blockade of Lebanon faulting it for not meeting the requirements of the [[w:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559|UN resolution]] governing the 15 day old ceasefire. The UN leader made his comments in [[w:Beirut|Beirut]] following talks with Lebanese Prime Minister [[w:Fuad Saniora|Fuad Saniora]].

"It's a fixed menu. . . . It's not an a la carte menu where you choose and pick," said Annan of the ceasefire provisions and the failure of both sides to fulfill them. He said that the truce had created the opportunity for a "long-term ceasefire and a long-term peace" but that all sides of the conflict had to fully implement the UN Security Council resolution for that to occur. 

Israel responded to Annan's comments by saying it intended to continue the blockade until international forces are deployed along Lebanon's border with [[w:Syria|Syria]] and other entry points in order to stop arms shipments to Hezbollah. 

"Once the international forces are fully in place and they're able to prevent the smuggling of weapons to Hezbollah, there will be no need for the air and naval blockade," said David Baker speaking on behalf of Israeli Prime Minister [[w:Ehud Olmert|Ehud Olmert]]. 

===Addresses Syrian concerns===

Annan said that the Lebanese army, not the international force, should have the responsibility of policing the border with Syria saying that the deployment of peacekeeping troops on the border of two countries that have not been at war would be unprecedented. Syrian President [[w:Bashar Assad|Bashar Assad]] has said having international forces on the country's border would be a "hostile" act. 

He stressed that southern Lebanon must become an arms free zone, "In Lebanon, there should be - as we have all agreed - one law, one authority, one gun," he said, and that the disarmament of Hezbollah must be achieved by national agreement within Lebanon and could not be implemented by international forces.   

Annan's visit to Lebanon is the first leg of a tour of the Middle East aimed at propping up the ceasefire. He will also be visiting Israel, Syria, the [[w:Palestinian Territories|Palestinian Territories]] and [[w:Iran|Iran]].

Security Council set to adopt non-binding text on N. Korea
{{date|October 6, 2006}}
{{North Korea nuclear program}}
The [[UN Security Council]] will "mostly likely" adopt a non-binding statement later today on [[North Korea|North Korea's]] announcement of planned nuclear bomb tests; the statement does not explicitly mention the threat of sanctions. This was announced by the Security Council president late yesterday.

[[Japan|Japan's]] UN envoy Kenzo Oshima, who chairs the 15-member body this month, said council experts made "good progress" in efforts to fine tune a Japanese draft, but said they had yet to finalize it.

"Most likely we will have something adopted (Friday)" once council members consult their respective capitals for "final clearance," he added.

Earlier on Thursday, Japan and the [[United States]] pushed for a threat to resort to mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This would includes arms, trade, and economic embargoes. [[China]] and [[Russia]] (two veto members of the Council) however, voted against the sanctions.

It is hoped that the latest text will urge Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear tests and return back to six-party talks "without precondition". North Korea had earlier boycotted the talks in response to a sanction placed by the US on one of its banks, believed to linked to the regime of {{w|Kim Jong-Il}}.

North Korea claims it has nuclear weapons, although this has not yet been independently verified.

Six Power Meetings confirmed on Iran's nuclear crisis
{{date|October 6, 2006}}
{{Iran nuclear program}}
Foreign ministers seeking to resolve [[Iran|Iran's]] nuclear crisis will meet in London today at 5P.M. local time (1600hrs GMT). The countries sending their foreign ministers are [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Russia]]. The participating nations, with the exception of Germany, have veto powers in the [[w:UN Security Council|UN Security Council]].

The UN Security Council is also likely to meet next week to discuss further action to take against Iran, following its failure to persuade Iran to freeze its uranium enrichment program.

Many western governments suspect that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capability. Iran insists that the enriched uranium is meant for power generation only.

Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, and European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana have executed four rounds of negotiations on Iran's nuclear program but have failed to make a breakthrough.

Solana's representative, Cristina Gallach, stressed the current diplomatic efforts were different from a European initiative in 2004-05, which ultimately failed.

"The offer of November 2004 was only one and a half pages long and only had the Europeans' signature, while the June 2006 offer has the signature of the whole Security Council and Germany," she said.

"The Americans are very much on board. It is a truly robust international offer."

The [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] has recommended the [[South Korea]]n foreign minister [[Ban Ki-moon]] for appointment as the next {{w|United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General}} of the United Nations.

Kenzo Oshima, [[Japan]]ese Ambassador to the United Nations expressed a hope that the Assembly presidency will act rapidly to elect him.

UN security council to vote on North Korean sanctions
{{date|October 14, 2006}}
{{North Korea nuclear program}}
The {{w|United Nations security council}} is expected to vote later today on whether to impose {{w|sanctions}} on [[North Korea]] after the country announced its first [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]] test last week. The current draft of the resolution would ban North Korea from importing any materials that could be used in the construction of nuclear weapons, it would also restrict international travel of those involved in the country's weapons program and their family members. The five permanent members of the council and [[Japan]] met on Friday morning to discuss the wording of the bill which should be put to a vote by the full fifteen members this afternoon.

The ban also covers the purchase of large scale {{w|conventional weaponry}} (such as tanks, ships, aircraft and missiles) but falls short of an outright ban on the import of military hardware. Imports of luxury goods will also be restricted. In the financial sector the resolution will also authorise the freezing of assets belonging to those suspected of involvement with North Korea's weapons program.
<!--[[Image:Hill christopher.jpg|thumb|left|Christopher Hill, US Assistant Secretary of State for Asia last night commented on N. Korean "threats."]]-->
The new resolution will come five days after North Korea announced its first nuclear weapons test on Monday. The test has come under international condemnation, for which North Korea has blamed the [[United States]]. State news channel KNCA said that the United States "hostile policy ... has gone beyond the tolerance limit and a dangerous atmosphere of confrontation, reminiscent of that on the eve of war, is now prevailing on the Korean Peninsula." In response a Christopher Hill, US {{w|Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs|Assistant Secretary of State}} for the area, called the comments "belligerent threats" and said that the US was not nervous of them.

A year ago North Korea walked out of 'six-party' talks (between both Koreas, the United States, [[China]], [[Russia]] and Japan) that were set up to rid {{w|Pyonyang}} of its nuclear program in return for economic incentives. The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Alexander Alexyev, said that North Korea was now willing to rejoin the talks, previously the country had left in protest over US financial sanctions.

Today's vote may be delayed by Russia and China who have requested last minute alterations to the bill. Although U.S. Ambassador [[John R. Bolton]] said last night that the changes were "technical" and that the vote would only be delayed by a few hours. The objections by the two countries appears to centre around the possible use of military personnel to enforce the resolution. China wish to ensure that the bill cannot be used (under {{w|Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter 7}} of the {{w|UN charter}}) as grounds or justification for military action against North Korea. They are also said to be worried about the wording of a section of the text that would allow nations to search any cargo to or from North Korea.

In the event of action against North Korea or for the countries economy to be hit China may suffer the most out of all of the nations on the council. They fear the influx of refugees into the country.

General Assembly elects Ban Ki-moon as next UN chief
{{date|October 14, 2006}}
[[Image:Bankimoon.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ban Ki-moon]]
South Korean [[Ban Ki-moon]], 68, has been endorsed unanimously by the {{w|UN General Assembly|general assembly}} to succeed [[Kofi Annan]] as the {{w|United Nations Secretary-General|secretary-general}} of the [[United Nations]], on October 13. 

He will take the position of Secretary General on January 1.

When asked by {{w|President of the United Nations General Assembly|assembly president}} {{w|Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa|Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa}} to adopt the resolution by an oral vote, the room filled with hundreds of diplomats and UN staff clapping loudly. A formal vote was not conducted as the decision was unanimous.

She banged her gavel after the vote and said, "It is so decided. I have the honor to announce that His Excellency Ban Ki-moon has been appointed by acclamation secretary-general of the United Nations. This is a historic day for the organization as it continues to evolve and live up to the values and principles of the {{w|United Nations Charter|&#91;UN&#93; Charter}}." 

At the time of the decision itself, the South Korean was the only candidate for the job - when informal polls were carried out within the UN, the other five individuals fared so badly that they all dropped out of the leadership race.

"I will work diligently to materialise our responsibility to protect the most vulnerable members of humanity and for the peaceful resolution of threats to international security and regional stability," Mr. Ban told the Assembly.

"The true measure of success for the UN is not how much we promise, but how much we deliver for those who need us most."

"The UN is needed now more than ever before."

Mr. Ban, the first Asian Secretary General since {{w|U Thant}} from [[Burma]], said he was committed to meeting {{w|United Nations Millennium Project|U.N. Millennium Development Goals}}, expanding peace operations and dealing with threats posed by terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, HIV/AIDS and other pandemics, environmental degradation and protecting human rights.

He also mentioned {{w|Reform of the United Nations|reform of the UN}}, something the [[United States]] — which contributes the largest part of the budget of the UN, with 22&nbsp;%&nbsp;, but also has arrears of 1.3 billion dollars — has long called for. However, the new Secretary General made clear that any changes would occur at his own pace.

"We reform not to please others, but because we value what this organisation stands for," he said. 

"We cannot change everything at once. But if we choose wisely, and work together transparently, flexibly and honestly, progress in a few areas will lead to progress in a few more." 

Kofi Annan, 68, described Ban as "a future secretary-general who is exceptionally attuned to the sensitivities of countries and constituencies in every continent. A man with a truly global mind at the helm of the world's only universal organisation."

He added that he wished Ban strength and courage as he prepared to take over the job and to "have fun along the way."

"We believe he is the right person to lead the United Nations at this decisive moment in its history, particularly as the UN struggles to fulfill the terms of the reform agenda that world leaders agreed to last fall," U.S. Ambassador [[John R. Bolton]] told the assembly.

Israeli Ambassador Danny Gillerman said that it was good for Israel's standing in the organization.

"If the secretary general is serious and fair and appoints underlings who are serious and fair, and the UN will be serious, clean and organized, this will be good for the Jews,"  said Mr. Gillerman.

Mr Ban will hold the position for five years until the next election in 2011.

North Korea returns to six-party talks
{{date|October 31, 2006}}
{{North Korea nuclear program}}
[[Image:Northkoreaflag.jpg|right|thumb|200px|North Korea conducted its first nuclear test three weeks ago]]
[[North Korea]] has today agreed to return to the {{w|six-party talks}} about its nuclear programme, as announced by the {{w|Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese}} and {{w|Federal government of the United States|U.S.}} governments. This comes after {{w|Politics of North Korea|Pyongyang}}'s withdrawal two weeks ago after the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] unanimously voted to impose sanctions on North Korea, which were ultimately designed to remove the ability to create nuclear weapons.

{{w|President of the United States|United States President}} [[George W. Bush]] has thanked the Chinese government for assisting and persuading North Korea to return to the talks. He went on to say that "<nowiki>[</nowiki>the US will<nowiki>]</nowiki> be sending teams to the region to work with our partners to make sure that the current {{w|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718|United Nations Security Council resolution}} is enforced but also make sure the talks are effective, that we achieve the result we want". Pyongyang did not make the lifting of the sanctions a condition for the resumption of the talks.

The negotiations between the six parties, North Korea, {{w|People's Republic of China|China}}, the {{w|United States|United States of America}}, {{w|South Korea}}, {{w|Russia}}, and {{w|Japan}}, could restart as early as November, said {{w|Christopher R. Hill}}, the chief US negotiator on North Korea. {{w|Politics of South Korea|South Korea}} was optimistic about the resumption of the talks. "The government hopes that the six-party talks will resume at an early date as agreed," said Choo Kyu-ho, spokesman for South Korea's foreign ministry.

Pranab and Oli discuss Nepal peace talks
{{date|November 6, 2006}}

The Indian External Affairs Minister [[w:Pranab Mukherjee|Pranab Mukherjee]] has talked with the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Nepal K P Sharma Oli to discuss the status of ongoing peace talks with the Maoist rebels.

Oli met Indian Prime Minister [[w:Manmohan Singh|Manmohan Singh]] and Pranab Mukherjee during his visit in [[w:New Delhi|New Delhi]]. Oli discussed the situation of the peace negotiations between the Nepal government and Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). He provided them an overview about the efforts being made by government to persuade the Maoists to quit the arms.

During an-hour long talk between Mukherjee and Oli, they reviewed the implementation of the economic package announced after Koirala's visit to India in June. They also discussed about the key infrastructure projects in Nepal, like, export of power from India to Nepal and construction of transmission lines.

The talk was important as Maoist and Nepal government are trying to resolve the issue.

Opposition to John Bolton's appointment to the UN grows
{{date|November 10, 2006}}
{{missing image|Image:John Bolton State Dept.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Ambassador John Bolton}}
The confirmation of [[John Bolton]] as the [[w:US Permanent Representative to the United Nations|US Permanent Representative to the United Nations]] is in doubt as Republican Senator [[w:Lincoln Chafee|Lincoln Chafee]] joins Democrats in opposing his nomination.

[[w:John Bolton|John Bolton]] was first nominated to the position by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] in March 2005, but his appointment was opposed at that time when the Democrats on the Senate appointments committee, along with Republican Senator [[w:George Voinovich|George Voinovich]]. He was then appointed by the President during congressional recess in August. This recess appointment must now be confirmed by the Senate.

Bolton's previous confirmation stalled after the Senate committee's demands for information about Bolton's activities while he was in the State Department were rejected by the administration. In addition, there were concerns about whether or not he had exaggerated reports about [[Syria|Syria's]] weaponry and doubts about the suitability of his temperament as an Ambassador for the United States. 

While the Senate is in recess, the President can make appointments which have to be ratified subsequently. President Bush appointed John Bolton as Permanent Representative to the UN on August 1, the first day of the recess, asserting that the post was too important to be left vacant at a time when the country was at war and there was a vital debate about the reform of the UN. 

Democratic Senator [[w:Edward Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] called the  appointment "an abuse of power". The appointment is due to be confirmed before January 2007 after which it lapses.

Dr. John Bolton, a prominent [[w:neoconservative|neoconservative]] and sometime aide to [[w:James Baker|James Baker]], has been highly critical of the [[w:UN|UN]] and its role in international affairs. His opinions were shared by other Republicans including Sen. [[w:Norm Coleman|Norm Coleman]] who is reported as saying that the UN was "mismanaged and possibly corrupt". He was nominated for a [[w:Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] in February this year by [[w:Per Ahjmark|Per Ahjmark]], former deputy prime minister  of [[w:Sweden|Sweden]]. 

President Bush is reported as saying that he wants Bolton's appointment confirmed before January when the Democrats take power. The present constitution of the Senate Committee is 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats and Republican Sen. George Voinovich had come to support Bolton's appointment. However, the move by Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee, on the grounds that, at the recent elections, the people had spoken out against US foreign policy, could result in a hung vote. That would result in John Bolton being removed from his position as US Ambassador to the UN.

[[Image:Mayotte-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|left|Mayotte is between Madagascar and the coast of Africa]]{{North Korea nuclear program}}
{{date|November 16, 2006}}

Officials on the {{w|Indian Ocean}} island of {{w|Mayotte}} said that a [[North Korea]]n vessel they searched today had no illegal cargo.

The UN passed Resolution 1718, imposing new sanctions on North Korea, in response to a {{w|nuclear weapon|nuclear weapon}} test in October.

Eritrea moves troops into UN buffer zone
{{date|October 17, 2006}}
{{Ethiopia infobox}}
On Monday, the [[United Nations]] accused [[Eritrea]] of moving some 1,500 soldiers and 14 tanks into a U.N. buffer zone, instituted six-years ago over a [[w:Eritrean-Ethiopian War|border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia]]. Eritrea claimed it has the right to move troops into its sovereign area. An Eritrean presidential advisor said the troops were working on development projects in the Temporary Security Zone. [[Ethiopia]] sees the action as a provocation.

A U.N. chief spokesman said that [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General]] [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] "urges the government of Eritrea to withdraw its troops from the zone immediately, and to cooperate with the United Nations in restoring the cease-fire arrangements." The U.N. had reduced its troops and military observers from 3,300 to 2,300 in May, and threatened late September to further reduce this number if the two countries do not move forward in their border conflict.

In 1962 the Emperor [[w:Haile Sellassie|Haile Sellassie]] of Ethiopia annexed Eritrea, which lead to the [[w:Eritrean War of Independence|Eritrean War of Independence]], until Eritrea regained control in 1991. The current border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia started in 1998, and ended in 2000 with a peace deal that stated the countries were bound to the decision of an independent commission ruling on the border issue. Ethiopia rejected the decision and insisted on further talks. Eritrea responded by hindering the peacekeepers' movements.

Last Sunday the [[w:Sudan|Sudanese]] government signed a peace treaty with the united rebel groups at the [[w:Eastern Front (Sudan)|Sudanese Eastern Front]], at the border with Eritrea. The Eritrean government changed their position from previously being the main supporter of the rebels, to striving for a cease-fire.

Despite 6 warnings Israel bombed and killed 4 UN observers
{{date|July 26, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
__NOTOC__
An Israeli bombardment killed four United Nations Observers, despite multiple warnings by UN peacekeeper. The peacekeepers at the post said the area within a kilometer of the post was hit with precision munitions, including 17 bombs and 12 artillery shells, four of which directly hit the UN observation post. The fatal strike with a "precision-guided weapon" according to UN military personnel hit the post at about 7.20pm. The victims were Austrian, Canadian, Chinese and Finnish UN-observers.

The Irish foreign ministry said that Israel ignored repeated warnings from Lieutenant-Colonel John Molloy, a key UN liaising officer, that its bombs were falling close to United Nations observers in southern Lebanon. The warnings came allegedly before an Israeli bomb killed four of the U.N. observers. "On six separate occasions he [Lieutenant-Colonel John Molloy] was in contact with the Israelis to warn them that their bombardment was endangering the lives of UN staff in South Lebanon". "He warned: 'You have to address this problem or lives may be lost'," an Irish foreign affairs spokesman said. 

Suzanne Coogan, a spokeswoman for the Irish Defence Minister Willie O'Dea said Molloy "warned the Israelis that they were shelling in very close proximity to the post, and his warnings were very specific, explicit, detailed and stark." She concluded, "Obviously those warnings went unheeded."

Irish Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern said "Evidence that we have would suggest that this was either an incredible accident or else was in some way directly targeted".

In 1996 over 100 civilians were killed by the Israeli bombing of a UN compound in Lebanon in an incident known as the [[w:Qana shelling|Qana shelling]].

==The United Nations==

Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, said "I am shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting by Israeli Defense Forces of a United Nations observer post in southern Lebanon that has killed two United Nations military observers, with two more feared dead." 

Kofi Annan also said "This coordinated artillery and aerial attack on a long established and clearly marked U.N. post at Khiyam occurred despite personal assurances given to me by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that U.N. positions would be spared Israeli fire."

According to an [[Wikipedia:UNIFIL|UNIFIL]] press release there were 14 prior incidents of firing close to this position by aerial bombs and artillery shells before the fatal hit occurred. Also, 9 UNIFIL bases were bombed earlier during this war but with no apparent casualties. It was also reported [[Hezbollah]] fired "from the vicinity" of United Nations positions in Alma ash Shab,  Tibnin, Brashit, At Tiri.

==Israeli representatives==

*'''Prime Minister'''
:Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, issued a statement. "It's inconceivable for the UN to define an error as an 'apparently deliberate' action."  He expressed his deep sorrow earlier on Wednesday over the deaths.

*'''Foreign Ministry spokesman'''
:"Israel sincerely regrets the tragic deaths of the UN personnel in south Lebanon," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev.

*'''Israeli Ambassadors'''
:Dan Ayalon, the Israeli Ambassador to the US, demanded that Annan apologize for the remarks, which he called "baseless."  The Israeli Ambassador to the UN, Dan Gillerman, expressed his "deep regret" for the deaths, and denied that the incident was intentional.  He said that he was "shocked and deeply distressed by the hasty statement of the Secretary-General, insinuating that Israel has deliberately targeted the UN post," calling the comments "premature and erroneous."

:Gillerman said "Israel is carrying out a thorough inquiry into this tragic incident and will inform the UN of its results as soon as possible."

*'''Israel Defense Forces (IDF)'''
:In a statement issued by the [[Wikipedia:Israel Defense Forces|Israel Defense Forces (IDF)]], "Following an initial inquiry, it appears that during the operation a UN post was unintentionally hit . . . The IDF is launching a full investigation in close coordination with the UN."

==China==

Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said "China urges the sides concerned, especially Israel, to take tangible measures to ensure the security of UN peacekeepers" .

Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Zhai Jun told Israeli Ambassador Yehoyada Haim "China strongly condemns the activity to raid the UN peacekeeping post and urges Israel to carry out a thorough investigation and apologize to China and the victim's families, and coordinate with China to deal with the aftermath".

The Chinese victim, named Du Zhaoyu, was a Lieutenant Colonel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He has been in Lebanon as a UN observer since January.

==Finland==

Finnish President Tarja Halonen wanted a full investigation of the attack and also said there was no justification for an attack on the U.N. post.

Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja said "It is not the first time that they (U.N. peace keepers) have been attacked, but it is the first time they have been killed." Mr Tuomioja continued  "These so called precision attacks seem to be hitting everyone except Hezbollah, there have been hundreds of civilians, international workers and others killed already and it does not seem that by these means a military solution could be achieved."

The Finnish victim was Lieutenant-Commander Jarno Mäkinen from Kaarina. He was 29 years old and joined United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in November 2005. Before that training officer and unit commander in the Uusimaa Brigade.

==Canada==

Prime Minister Stephen Harper says Israel's deadly attack on a UN observation post in Lebanon was a "terrible tragedy". He doubts that the bombing was deliberate. "I certainly doubt that to be the case, given that the government of Israel has been co-operating with us in our evacuation efforts" "We want to find out why this United Nations post was attacked and also why it remained manned during what is now, more or less, a war during obvious danger to these individuals."

Mr Harper said he was waiting for a call from Olmert. "I expect that he will be expressing his deep regret. But also I'll be asking for his full co-operation in getting to the bottom of this." He also said he would follow the results of the UN and Israeli investigation rather than launching his own.

The Canadian victim is Major Paeta Hess-von Kruedener, a member of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. He had completed nine months of his one-year assignment with the UN in Lebanon.

On July 18, Major Paeta Hess-von Kruedener provided CTV.ca with an update of his mission via e-mail.
He said that there had been numerous occasions when his post had come under fire. "What I can tell you is this: we have on a daily basis had numerous occasions where our position has come under direct or indirect fire from both artillery and aerial bombing,"  

"The closest artillery has landed within two meters of our position and the closest 1000 lb aerial bomb has landed 100 meters from our patrol base." Retired Canadian Major General Lewis Mackenzie was interviewed on CBC radio, and told of an e-mail letter from Kruedener. "He was telling us that Hezbollah soldiers were all over his position and the IDF were targeting them. Since Hezbollah don't have representation in the UN, they use the UN as shields knowing that they can't be punished for it."

==Austria==

A statement from Austria foreign ministry issued by foreign minister Ursula Plassnik said "Such an attack on unarmed UN observers is entirely unacceptable and can in no way be justified" Ursula Plassnik expressed Austria's indignation over the attack and demanded an immediate and thorough investigation into the incident.

Montenegro becomes 192nd UN Member State
{{date|June 28, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag of Montenegro.svg|200px|right]]
[[w:Montenegro|Republic of Montenegro]] became 192nd member state of the [[United Nations]], following a vote in the [[w:General Assembly of the United Nations|General Assembly]].

After the protocol officers had escorted the Montenegrin delegation to their seats in the Assembly, flag-raising ceremony took place in front of UN headquarters in [[w:New York City|New York City]]. Secretary-General [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] welcomed the newest member by praising non-violent and democratic process that gained Montenegro its independence from state union of [[w:Serbia and Montenegro|Serbia and Montenegro]], through an [[w:Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]], on May 22, 2006.

Montenegro is the latest country to be admitted to the UN, following the international recognition of [[w:East Timor|East Timor]] in 2002.

France offers promised 2000 soldiers to the UN in Lebanon
{{date|August 24, 2006}}
[[Image:FS Mistral 02.jpg|thumb|French ship ''[[w:French command ship Mistral|Mistral]]'' is already enroute, carrying 100 engineering vehicles for the [[w:UNIFIL|UNIFIL]].]]
[[Image:Leclerc p1040621.jpg|thumb|Deployment of [[w:Leclerc|Leclerc]] battle tanks has been evoked by the French press.]]
After a meeting with the government and general officers, [[w:French President|French President]] [[w:Jacques Chirac|Jacques Chirac]] announced today that the French complement in the [[w:UNIFIL|UNIFIL]] will be increased to 2,000. 

"Conditions required by France being fulfilled, I decided to favourably answer the requests of the General Secretary of the United Nations, and of the Lebanese and Israeli governments", Chirac declared; "two more battalions will come to reinforce our deployment on the field within the UNIFIL. 2,000 French soldiers will thus serve under the blue helmet in Lebanon".

Chirac also underlined that the deployment of the 1,700 strong [[w:Opération Baliste|Opération Baliste]] would continue.

UNIFIL is currently headed by French Major General [[w:Alain Pellegrini|Alain Pellegrini]].

France initially surprised the world by promising to send only 200 more soldiers, after playing a major diplomatic role in settling the cease-fire, and while a reinforcement of the UNIFIL to 15,000 troops had been announced by the United Nations. The press has commented that France is reluctant to send Blue Helmets without clear rules of engagements and guarantees, after the experience of the [[w:UNPROFOR|UNPROFOR]] in Bosnia, where French soldiers had been forced to witness atrocities without being able to intervene, had been taken hostages without means to defend themselves, and had suffered heavy casualties.

Countries expected to contribute the bulk of the troops to the "reinforced UNIFIL" are France, [[w:Italy|Italy]] and [[w:Spain|Spain]]; reinforcements are also expected from [[w:Belgium|Belgium]] and [[w:Greece|Greece]]. 

President Chirac said that he wanted a "fair repartition of contributions" and called for "other permanent members of the Security Council" to contribute; he mentioned that "Several European partners will do so, as well as important Muslim countries of Asia". Chirac cited [[w:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|United Nations Resolution 1701]] by requesting "the release of the abducted Israeli soldiers, the return of the Lebanese prisoners, the delineation of the borders, especially in the Shebaa Farms area". 

Lebanese Prime minister [[w:Fouad Siniora|Fouad Siniora]] declared that "the decision from President Chirac helps Lebanon, reinforced her stability, and helps her get back her territory through Israeli withdrawal, and instaur authority of the State in South Lebanon".

Violence in East Timor causes United Nations evacuation
{{date|May 29, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|left|thumb|180px|Flag of the United Nations]]
{{aussieissue|2006 East Timor crisis}}
An upsurge in violence in [[w:East Timor|East Timor]] has made the [[United Nations]] evacuate hundreds of staff members and families from the country. 

Sukehiro Hasegawa, the Special Representative to Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Dili said, "A temporary relocation for non-essential staff is the most judicious choice at this time."

The decision comes after the Australian-led peacekeeping operation and the East Timorese government struggled to contain unrest in [[w:Dili|Dili]], the country's capital. 

Gang members, some wielding machetes, have been fighting along ethnic lines. There also has been looting and buildings have been razed. 

Staff members and families will be relocated to Darwin, Australia. Over 100 United Nations staff will remain in East Timor awaiting the arrival of more Australian peacekeeping forces.

The peacekeeping operation began after an appeal by the government for international help. Australian forces are part of the multinational force that numbers over 2000 military personnel. 

The peacekeepers say they do not directly engage in combat. This brought confusion from one child who said, "Why aren't the Australians doing anything?" 

The Australian Prime Minister John Howard said, "It's a trickier operation than some people think, nobody should assume that it's just a simple walk-in-the-park military operation -- it's quite challenging."

UN appeals for more aid for devastated Pakistan region
{{date|October 20, 2005}}

===UN comments on alleged lack of aid===
[[Image:Kofi Annan.jpg|left|thumb|Kofi Annan, Secretary general of the United Nations]]
[[Kofi Annan]], [[w:Secretary General of the United Nations|Secretary General of the United Nations]], has sent out a plea for more aid for regions of Pakistan affected by this month's devastating [[w:2005 Kashmir earthquake|earthquake]]. He fears thousands could die if aid does not arrive soon.

The death toll from the earthquake is already feared to be at least 79,000. 

"...Unlike some natural disasters, in which victims die immediately, the death toll in Pakistan is not over yet," Annan says. "An estimated three million men, women and children are homeless.  Many of them have no blankets or tents to protect them against the merciless Himalayan winter. That means a second, massive wave of death will happen if we do not step up our efforts now.

Helicopters and trucks are of the greatest need.

"The money to pay for those things has been lacking", said Annan."So far, we have received firm commitments for only 12 per cent of our appeal. That is $37 million US out of the $312 million that we need."

During the massive relief effort for the Dec. 26 tsunami 80 percent of the appeal was filled in 10 days.

A major donor conference has been called for next week by Annan. He hopes it will help speed up aid.

"There are no excuses," Annan also said.  "If we are to show ourselves worthy of calling ourselves members of humankind, we must rise to this challenge."

===Officials suggest major evacuation===
Emergency relief co-ordinator Jan Egeland said today that NATO needs to organize a massive air-lift if it wants to save lives.
The evacuation needs to take place before winter sets in. The main taget would be small isolated villages.

NATO ''has'' been air-lifting in aid every day from it's base in Germany. Another "air brigade" was added recently from Turkey.

The major airlift is needed "to get supplies in and people out," Egeland told CBC News on Thursday.
In order to shelter everyone who is homeless they need, "350,000 tents, which is a mind-boggling number, more than we know exist in the world, are needed..." 
"We have emptied all of our warehouses."

===Difficult decisions being made on rescue front===
Feeling the need to prevent the feared second wave of death, rescuers are in the process of making hard decisions. Aid workers have decided that, this weekend, the focus will switch from treating 87,000 injured to getting aid to the homeless.

"It's a tough call but we have to face the fact that we're going to save more lives by getting tents, shelter, food, and supplies up to the people who have nothing [rather] than continuing to bring the injured down," said Capt. Edward Parsons, with the UN's Humanitarian Relief Operation in Pakistan

Helicopters are "double tasking" in their trips to small villages. They drop off supplies then pick up the injured.
However, the method is proving time-consuming, the need to speed up inward air-lifts is growing.

Activists remember Burundi's Gatumba massacre
{{date|August 13, 2005}}   
[[Image:LocationBurundi.png||right]]
Human rights groups around the world are marking the first anniversary of the [[w:Gatumba|Gatumba]] massacre, in which more than 150 Congolese "Banyamulenge" [[w:Tutsis|Tutsis]] were killed, at a refugee camp in western Burundi.    

"On this first anniversary of this unspeakable atrocity, we have the moral obligation to honour the memory of these people who were killed just because of their Tutsi ethnic origins", said Emmanuel Nkurunziza of the Burundian campaign group "Action Contre [[w:Genocide|Genocide]]".

"The search for those responsible for the massacre continues", said the UN's mission to Burundi (ONUB), in a statement. 

In the immediate aftermath of the Gatumba attack, the hardlined Hutu-extremist rebel group Palipehutu-FNL (FNL) claimed responsibility, saying that they had no fear of being held to account because they had become "untouchable". UN investigators suggest that Rwandan and Congolese milita groups may also have been involved in the attack. The FNL later claimed that the [[w:refugee|refugee]] camp was a military base. The UN has found no evidence for this claim, and human rights groups pointed out that nearly half of the dead were children.

2,000 people, including survivors and relatives of the dead, today attended a memorial service in Burundi, Reuters has reported. 

"What happened on August 13 was a genocide... One year after the massacre nothing has been done... We demand that justice be done", [[w:Banyamulenge|Banyamulenge]] spokesman Binagana Amon is quoted as saying. Amon also criticised the United Nations for its "silence" over the attack. 

The London-based "International Action Network on Small Arms" ([[w:IANSA|IANSA]]) today paid tribute to the 156 victims of Gatumba, who included a local member of the organisation, Pastor Jaques Rutekereza. 

"His deep faith gave him the courage to face his awful death, and the death of those he loved, with dignity and courage", IANSA said last year, in a statement honouring  Rutekereza. "The world has lost a great man. It has lost a man of peace."

Rutekereza died with six of his children, according to IANSA. 

Members of the [[w:Congolese|Congolese]] diaspora have been active in the commemorations. The community in Portland, Maine has organised a weekend of events, including public testimonies from those who lost loved ones in the attack, and a talk by John B. Robinson, who helped produce the film "[[w:Hotel Rwanda|Hotel Rwanda]]."

"We can't forget them", Georges Budagu told the Portland Press Herald. 

"We want to make sure the United Nations and the United States use their influence to bring those people... to justice". Three of Budagu's cousins died in the massacre. 

The UN, in turn, asked the Burundian authorities to do more to pursue the perpetrators:

"In the name of the victims, and as part of the effort to end impunity for the killings and massacres that have plagued this region for too many years, we urge the Government of [[w:Burundi|Burundi]] to complete its investigation, issue the report of its findings and bring those responsible to justice."

The UN also repeated its call for Burundi to involve the [[w:International Criminal Court|International Criminal Court]] in the investigation. Previous efforts had stalled due to opposition to the Court within the UN Security Council.

Following the FNL's admission of responsibility for Gatumba, the Burundian government produced international arrest warrants for the group's leaders Agathon Rwasa and Pasteur Habimana. Regional heads condemned the group as a terrorist organisation, with South African's President [[w:Thabo Mbeki|Thabo Mbeki]] likening the FNL's ideology to that of the [[w:Nazis|Nazis]]. Yet when Rwasa held a press conference in Tanzania in May, no attempt was made to arrest him. A ceasefire deal signed soon afterwards broke down within days. 

Burundi's refugee minister Francoise Ngendahayo today said that her government is committed to seeing justice for the victims of Gatumba. 

"Those responsible will be arrested but Burundi cannot do this work alone, we need the collaboration of the DR Congo and the UN", she told Reuters.

Burundi's President-elect recently suggested that the FNL could be allowed to join his government. Some analysts believe that offering the group an amnesty might help bring peace to Burundi. Others argue that this could make the situation worse.

"For reasons of diplomacy, people are sitting at the exact same table as war criminals, and in some cases granting them immunity. If the atrocities are to end there must be at least some indications that justice will be done", [[w:Human Rights Watch|Human Rights Watch]] spokesman Stephan Van Praet told Reuters, in the aftermath of Gatumba.

Action Contre Genocide's Emmanuel Nkurunziza today criticised the UN for what he called a "paradoxical" response to the massacre. Despite widespread international condemnation of the attack, the UN representative in Burundi Carolyn McAskie held face-to-face meetings with the FNL in [[w:Nairobi|Nairobi]] earlier this year.

"There was no repentance from these killers prior to the meeting; nonetheless, she went on to relay their so-called demands", he said.

Local media recently reported 300 civilian deaths at the hands of the FNL during June and July.  An estimated 300,000 people, mostly [[w:civilians|civilians]], have died in Burundi since civil war broke out in 1993.

USA rejects UN Guantanamo report
{{date|February 21, 2006}}

[[w:Scott McClellan|Scott McClellan]], White House spokesman, dismissed a [[United Nations]] report today dealing with the [[w:Guantánamo Bay|Guantánamo Bay]] facilities.  The UN report said that the [[United States]] government should "expeditiously bring all Guantánamo Bay detainees to trial" without further delay, and called upon the U.S. to close the Guantánamo Bay detention facility.

McClellan responded, "These are dangerous terrorists that we're talking about that are there and I think we've talked about that issue before and nothing's changed in terms of our views." McClellan added, "We know that these are dangerous terrorists that are being kept at Guantanamo Bay. They are people that are determined to harm innocent civilians or harm innocent Americans. They were enemy combatants picked up on the battlefield in the war on terrorism." 

Three months ago, the US Ambassador to the [[Czech Republic]], Jan Krc, asked that country to give [[wikt:asylum|asylum]] to a group of Guantanamo detainees which would have set them free in Europe. The U.S. request to the Czechs about asylum was "a humanitarian request because we clearly need to place these people somewhere," Krc said.

In a press encounter, [[Kofi Annan]] responded to a journalist, he didn't accept all the conclusions of the report but, "Sooner or later there will be a need to close Guantanamo, sooner or later". He said, "I cannot agree with everything in the report, but I did indicate that the basic premise, that we need to be careful to have a balance between effective action against terrorism and individual liberties and civil rights, I think is valid."

The United Nations report is based upon information from the United States Government, interviews conducted by the experts with former Guantanamo Bay detainees currently residing or detained in [[France]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]].  The U.S. government's invitation for UN investigators to visit the prison was turned down because the United States would not allow the UN investigation team to conduct interviews with detainees. The report follows an 18 month study by 5 experts in various areas of human rights.

Lebanon faces humanitarian crisis
{{date|July 23, 2006}}

More than half a million people have been displaced in [[w:Lebanon|Lebanon]] as the conflict between [[w:Israel|Israel]] and [[Hezbollah]] continues into its second week. The UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland, who visited Beirut said that a humanitarian crisis was unfolding in the country and outlined planned relief efforts. Efforts are underway to open a safe corridor to allow aid shipments to be sent to Lebanon. The evacuation of foreign nationals from Lebanon continues. Israel launched more air strikes and also a ground incursion into Lebanon, and Hezbollah launched rocket attacks on northern Israel.

==UN relief coordinator visits Beirut==
[[Image:Beirut 2006 bomb damaged buildings.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Buildings damaged by bombing in Beirut <br> Source: Haitham Moussawi/IRIN]]
[[w:Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator|UN relief coordinator]] [[w:Jan Egeland|Jan Egeland]] flew to [[w:Beirut|Beirut]] for a 48 hour visit to Lebanon focused on assistance required by people displaced or trapped by the conflict.

He visited Haret Hreik, a crowded Beirut neighborhood where Hezbollah had its headquarters, hours after it was bombed by Israel. Calling the destruction there "horrific", he said, "I did not know it was block after block of houses,... It makes it a violation of humanitarian law". Mr. Egeland appealed for both sides to put a halt to attacks.

The Israeli government said the military was trying to be as precise as possible in its operations in Lebanon. "The Lebanese people are not our enemy. We cannot sit idly by while Hezbollah terrorists launch rockets at our towns and cities," Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said.

Mr. Egeland said there was a humanitarian crisis unfolding in Lebanon, and more than half a million people were directly affected. He said that wounded people were unable to get treatment, no safe drinking water was available and that tens of thousands of civilians were caught in the crossfire between the Israeli Defense Forces and Hezbollah militants, particularly in south Lebanon. He expected the number of displaced to increase "dramatically" as Israel has warned the population of south Lebanon to leave the area ahead of possible new military action there.

Outlining plans for a "major" relief operation, he called for an end to violence to facilitate the aid effort, saying, "We can't get relief into the country in any quantity or distribute it beyond a few points".

{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
==Situation in Lebanon==
The Lebanese newspaper ''Daily Star'' reports that the number of displaced people in Lebanon passed 900,000 on Friday, with close to 40,000 refugees in Beirut itself. Other estimates place the number of refugees between half a million and a million. 

Israel has urged the remaining people living in south Lebanon to leave, and streams of people, some carrying white flags, are making their way from the south. 

About 42,000 refugees had flooded into the city of [[w:Sidon|Sidon]] from the surrounding countryside - believing it to be safe from attacks - when it was hit by Israeli strikes today.

In several towns and cities, food, medical supplies and fuel stocks are running low, and municipal authorities have expressed their inability to assist people. They have called for urgent shipments of food products such as milk, rice, sugar and canned meat; diapers and kitchen tools; medicine such as insulin, painkillers, antibiotics and chlorine to clean water; sterilized gloves; refrigerators to store medicine; tents; electrical generators of 5, 10, 20 and 30 kVA; blankets and other necessities.

In the government hospital in the Al-Bass Palestinian refugee camp, the mass burial of 86 bodies was begun, after rising casualties overwhelmed the local morgue. 

===Infrastructure hit===
The air strikes and bombardment of roads, bridges and trucks has made supplying aid to affected areas even more difficult. Lebanon's only international airport has been out of action since the first days of the conflict. Reports estimate that billions of dollars worth of infrastructure has been destroyed.

==UN plans relief operation==
The UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland spoke to reporters of the plans for getting aid to Lebanon. He said UN supplies of humanitarian aid would begin to arrive in the next few days. "But we need safe access," he said. "So far Israel is not giving us access." He estimated that US $100 million is urgently needed to help the half a million to one million people in Lebanon who were in need of international assistance. 

U.N. and other relief agencies have been asking for humanitarian aid corridors to be opened up. Israel said it opened a 50-mile-long and five-mile-wide (80-kilometre by eight-kilometre) safe passage to Beirut for ships and aircraft to allow aid into Lebanon.

Egeland said the United Nations was planning to deliver aid by setting up humanitarian corridors in the next few days. Aid will be shipped by road and by sea from Cyprus to Beirut and the southern city of Tyre, and by air. 

The evacuation of foreign nationals from Lebanon continues, with most being taken to the island of Cyprus, where temporary accommodation has to be found for the estimated 70,000 evacuees, in the middle of the holiday tourist season. 

The [[w:United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL) says that it plans to evacuate civilians from the Lebanese-Israeli border in the next few days, but "the ability to move will depend on the situation on the ground".

==Situation in Israel==
Meanwhile, thousands of Israelis have been living in bomb shelters since the fighting in Lebanon started and between a third to a half of all residents in northern Israel have left the area to escape the bombardment, officials said.
 
"For a week people have been sitting in shelters and security rooms, so they prefer to leave," said Adi Eldar, mayor of Carmiel in a report on ''Haaretz'' newspaper's Web site.

==Attacks continue==
On Saturday, more television stations and mobile telephone masts in Lebanon were targeted in Israeli strikes, killing five people, including a television station employee.

Israel struck Beirut, Sidon, a port city in the south crammed with refugees, for the first time and factories, roads and bridges in air strikes in the eastern [[w:Baalbek|Baalbek]] region, killing one person.

In [[w:Haifa|Haifa]], two people were killed by rockets fired by Hezbollah forces, and fifteen people are reported injured.

==Casualty figures rise==
Current estimates say that more than 350 Lebanese and at least 36 Israelis have been killed in the conflict. One third of those killed in Lebanon are children, according to a UN report released July 21.

UN Security Council considers Cote d'Ivoire sanctions
{{date|September  1, 2005}}

Yesterday, the [[United Nations Security Council]] said it would take all steps necessary, including the implementation of individual sanctions, in order to ensure that the resolutions of the Security Council were adhered to by both sides of the troubled Ivoiran peace process.  The remarks followed a briefing to the Security Council by representatives from the UN Mission in [[Ivory Coast|Cote d'Ivoire]] and African Union-appointed [[South Africa]]n mediators.

"The South African Mediation stated that it will continue its efforts, with the support of the [[United Nations]] and the African Union, to ensure the holding of free, fair and transparent elections in Côte d'Ivoire as scheduled, which is the only solution to the crisis," the Security Council said in a statement following the meeting.  

The next round of elections are scheduled for the end of October although it is widely believed this date is unlikely to be met.

The peace process in [[Ivory Coast|Cote d'Ivoire]] has been on shaky ground following the failure of the rebel forces to begin the disarmament process originally scheduled for 31 July.  The rebels, led by the Forces Nouvelles, claimed that Ivorian [[Laurent Gbagbo|President Gbagbo]] had failed to make the necessary legal reforms necessary to begin the disarmament.  The international community later ratified the legal changes made by the Ivorian government as being in compliance with the peace deal.

U.S. found in violation of Native Americans rights
{{date|March 13, 2006}}
[[Image:Yucca Mountain USGS.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[w:Yucca Mountain|Yucca Mountain]], a sacred mountains and burial ground planned to be US first long-term geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel]]
A [[w:UN|UN]] [[w:United Nations Commission on Human Rights|(UNCHR)]] committee on the [[w:Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD)]] found the [[w:Federal government of the United States|the US government]] in violation of [[w:Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans']] land rights and the international anti-racism convention.
The committee of 18 independent experts said in a press release that it had received credible information alleging that Western [[w:Shoshone|Shoshone]] peoples were being denied their traditional right to land. The decision details US actions against the [[w:Western Shoshone|Western Shoshone]] and calls upon the United States to immediately:

*  Respect and protect the human rights of the Western Shoshone peoples.
* Initiate a dialogue with the representatives of the Western Shoshone peoples in order to find a solution acceptable to them, and which complies with their rights.
* Adopt the following measures until a final decision or settlement is reached on the status, use and occupation of Western Shoshone ancestral lands in accordance with due process of law and US obligations under the Convention.
* Freeze all efforts to privatize Western Shoshone ancestral lands for transfer to multinational extractive industries and energy developers.
* Desist from all activities planned and/or conducted on Western Shoshone ancestral lands.
* Stop imposing grazing fees, livestock impoundments, and hunting, fishing and gathering restrictions; and rescind all notices already given.

[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.png|left|180px|thumb|[[w:United Nations|Flag of the United Nations]] ]]
Bernice Lalo, Western Shoshone delegate, said, "The mines are polluting our waters, destroying hot springs and exploding sacred mountains&mdash;our burials along with them&mdash;attempting to erase our signature on the land. We are coerced and threatened by mining and Federal agencies when we seek to continue spiritual prayers for traditional food or medicine on Shoshone land." Mr. Lalo continued, "We feel the decision will be helpful by opening the door. We will continue this struggle to give our children a better chance."

Joe Kennedy, a Western Shoshone, said, "We have rights to protect our homelands and stop the destruction of our land, water, and air by the abuses of the United States government and the multinational corporations. He said, "The situation is outrageous, and we're glad the United Nations Committee agrees with us."
[[Image:Oxfam Logo.gif|left|100px|Oxfam logo]]
Laura Inouye, [[w:Oxfam|Oxfam]] America, said, "This is a tremendous victory for the Shoshone people; the UN decision acknowledges the U.S. government's violations of Shoshone civil, political, economic, and cultural rights." Inouye concluded, "Hopefully, they will now be granted the justice that the US government has denied them for years." Oxfam America is a human rights organizaition which has backed the Western Shoshone.

A UN official said, according to the AP, that the US mission to the UN in Geneva had no immediate response to the decision.

The Western Shoshones' rights to the land, 60 million acres stretching across [[w:Nevada|Nevada]], [[w:Idaho|Idaho]], [[w:Utah|Utah]] and [[w:California|Califonia]], were recognized by the US under the [[w:Treaty of Ruby Valley 1863|1863 Treaty of Ruby Valley]], which was signed by [[w:Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant]] a few years later. 
It was questioned by [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|the US Supreme Court]], 1979; the land was labeled 'government trusteeship' and much was claimed as federal territory. [[w:George W. Bush|President Bush]] signed a bill in July 2004 that gave approval to distributing more than $145 million as compensation after the Shoshones voted to accept the distribution in a disputed election. 

Jim Manley, a spokesman for [[w:Harry Reid|Sen. Harry Reid]] (D. Nevada) and a proponent of the bill, said "The tribe twice has voted decisively in favor of the distribution."

U.S. calls for sanctions against Iran
{{date|August 30, 2006}}
{{Iran nuclear program}}
The [[w:United States|U.S.]] [[w:United States State Department|State Department]] has called for sanctions against [[w:Iran|Iran]] and has also said that Iran has not indicated to the [[United Nations]] that they intend to follow through with halting their [[w:Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]]. 

"We would expect that the parties would immediately begin formal discussions about a resolution that would call for sanctions," said spokesman for the State Dapartment, [[w:Sean McCormack|Sean McCormack]].

"[Sanctions] have been our intention for some months, it remains our intention, it'll be our intention on September the first if the Iranians don't comply with the resolution," said [[John R. Bolton]], the U.S. embassador to the United Nations.

Today, the ''Washington Post'' reported that the [[w:International Atomic Energy Agency|International Atomic Energy Agency]] will report to the U.N. tomorrow that Iran is still enriching Uranium despite a U.N. resolution calling for the country to halt its nuclear program.

The [[w:China|Chinese]] Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing however, has called for a "diplomatic resolution" to Iran's nuclear program.

Iran's President, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] said that sanctions will not stop Iran from their "lofty goals of progress." He also said that [[w:Europe|Europe]] should "be independent [from the U.S.] in decision-making and to settle problems through negotiations" in regards to Iran's nuclear program.

The deadline set by the U.N. is set to expire on August 31.

Australian opposition minister gives speech on poverty
{{date|October 20, 2005}}

Australian shadow minister for work, family, youth, and community, [[w:Tanya Plibersek|Tanya Plibersek]], gave a speech today on poverty as part of Anti-Poverty Week 2005. During the speech she criticised the government in a number of areas, including not committing to the UN Millennium Development Goals, the proposed industrial relations legislation, and the governments funding of services for the homeless. 

Anti-Poverty Week runs from Monday 17th to Friday 21st October, and is derived from the United Nations International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on October 17th. Shaun Mortimer, the coordinator of Anti-Poverty Week at UNSW, said that the week was about "creating awareness and finding solutions to the plight of those living in poverty all around the world."

===UN foreign aid target===

Ms Plibersek said that Australia is not doing enough to help those in poverty overseas. She said that Australia currently gives 0.28% of its [[w:Gross National Income|Gross National Income]] in foreign aid, however this is far short of the United Nations target of 0.7%. 

"The Australian government is refusing to commit to the 0.7% target," she said. 

The UN development goal states that governments should reach the target by 2015. Labor has committed to meet the target, but the government has not. 

"Labor is committed to the 0.7% target. In the interim, the government should be spending 0.5% of GNI," Ms Plibersek said. 

===Millennium Development Goals===

Shadow Minister Plibersek accused the government of weakening Australias commitment to the [[w:Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals]]. The goals were agreed to in 2000 by all 191 member states of the United Nations. There are 8 goals, which signatory states have committed to work towards. The eight goals are:

#Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
#Achieve universal primary education
#Promote gender equality and empower women
#Reduce child mortality
#Improve maternal health
#Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
#Ensure environmental sustainability
#Develop a global partnership for development

Ms Plibersek said that Australia signed on to the goals, but is now not honouring that commitment, and is attempting to reduce the impact of the goals in an attempt to win the favour of the United States. 

"We signed on to the millennium goals," she said. 

"In it's rush to be popular with the US the government went along with watering down the millennium goals"

===Industrial Relations legislation===

Shadow Minister Plibersek strongly criticised the governments proposed industrial relations legislation. She argued that the proposed changes will disproportionately affect already vulnerable people such as single mothers, and push working people into poverty. 

"Industrial relations changes will see poverty worsen. It will increase the number of working poor," she said. 

Speaking about the governments hypthetical worker, "Billy", used in promotional material, Ms Plibersek said individual workplace agreements will result in lowered working conditions for all workers. She also claimed that if a working person is paid a wage that does not provide them with enough resources to live, they will need to depend on government services such as income support, and therefore taxpayers will be subsidising the low wages. 

"If Billy can not earn enough to live, then taxpayers are effectively subsidising business," she said. 

"If the system has no minimum standards it will drag everyone down. Unions have fought against this for over a century"

===Poverty in Australia===

Ms Plibersek spoke about the problem of poverty in Australia. She said that 2.4 million people in Australia are living below the poverty line, and 1 million of them have jobs. She also argued that wealth inequality is getting worse. 

"We have a nation now more divided than ever. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer," she said. 

Ms Plibersek felt that this situation was unnaceptable, and that the solution was only a matter of will. 

"I don't think we have to accept that people will always be poor. It is a situation we allow," she said. 

She also criticised the government for inadequately funding services for the homeless, and said that many homeless people who wanted help were unable to find any. Ms Plibersek argued that women escaping domestic violence were especially affected by this situation. 

"We turn away 1 in 2 people who approach homeless services for help," she said. 

Ms Plibersek also condemned what the government describes as the "skills shortage", saying that there are lots of Australians willing to gain skills, but are unable to get places in training institutions. 

"We turn 20,000 people away from TAFE and University each year," she said.

Australian PM faces inquiry into Iraqi kickbacks
{{date|April 14, 2006}}

{{Australian news}}{{aussieissue|Cole Inquiry}}[[Image:JHoward official.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Official photograph of Mr Howard]][[w:Australia|Australian]] [[w:Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], [[w:John Howard|John Howard]] appeared before the [[w:Cole inquiry|Cole inquiry]] on Thursday, the first time an Australian Prime Minister has appeared before an inquiry with royal commission powers since 1983.

Unlike his foreign minister [[w:Alexander Downer|Alexander Downer]] who gave evidence before the inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Howard entered through the front door where he gave a brief address. He told the press that his government is being open about the Iraqi kickback affair. " just want to make one point and that is that the appearance by me, earlier this week by the Foreign Minister and also by the Trade Minister, demonstrates absolutely how open and transparent and accountable the Government is being in relation to this matter" Mr Howard said to reporters.

Mr Howard was questioned by John Agius, counsel assisting the inquiry. Counsel for [[w:Australian Wheat Board|AWB]], the company at the centre of the scandal did not apply to cross-examine the prime minister.

Terrence Cole, the inquiry's commissioner received an application from Peter Geary and Micheal Long's counsel to cross-examine the prime minister but refused it on the grounds that the proposed line of questioning was similar to that of Mr Aguis' and that there was no evidence that Mr Howard had "ever met with Mr Geary or Mr Long".

Mr Agius questioned the prime minister about a series of diplomatic cables sent to his office, which raised concerns about AWB's contracts in Iraq.

Mr Howard told the inquiry that he doesn't recall reading or being briefed about any of the cables referred to by the inquiry. The inquiry also heard that prior to 2003 there was no system in place to identify which cables had been bought to the prime minister's attention.

In his statement to the inquiry, Mr Howard said that his office had not received four of the cables mentioned by the inquiry. Under questioning, Mr Howard confirmed this but conceded that it was likely that his staff had read the other 17.

When asked whether there were any guidelines which guided his advisors in deciding which cables should be bought to the prime minister's attention, Mr Howard replied "No, there weren't".

The inquiry heard that the only discussions about which cables which should be bought to Mr Howard's attention occurred when an advisor changed in very generic terms. Mr Howard told the inquiry that he would tell a new advisor "Well, you've got to exercise your own judgment, I can't possibly read everything, and clearly I want things brought to my attention which are, in your judgment, important and are relevant to issues in front of the government at the time".

Mr Howard admitted that the government had an interest in Iraq using the [[United Nations]] oil for food program for its own financial benefit, but said he did not expect cables dealing with alleged breach of UN sanctions to have been bought to his attention.

The questioning then turned to a statement Mr Howard made to the National Press Club on March 13, 2003, one week prior to the US-led Iraqi occupation. Speaking about [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]] Mr Howard said "He has cruelly and cynically manipulated the United Nations oil-for-food programme. He's rorted it to buy weapons to support
his designs at the expense of the wellbeing of his people".

Mr Agius asked Mr Howard if his statement was based upon briefngs he had received. Mr Howard told the inquiry that the information was based upon "open source" intelligence stated at addresses by [[w:Britain|British]] foreign secretary [[w:Jack Straw|Jack Straw]] and the [[w:United States|United States]] state department. Mr Howard said one of his advisors "checked with some cables to confirm that those cables supported the open-source claims and was satisfied that they did".

Mr Howard denied seeing the cables used by the advisor to support the claims, but believed he would have told her to be sure that everything they were saying can be supported by fact. Mr Howard told the inquiry that he never knew about cables which referred to Hussein rorting the UN Oil for Food program. Mr Howard admitted that at the time his "general knowledge" was that Hussein had breached UN sanctions and was rorting the Oil for Food program.

"My general knowledge at the time and belief was that the program had been rorted, and it was not seriously in dispute. Nobody was arguing it hadn't been rorted" Mr Howard said.

The prime minister was questioned about an unassessed intelligence report which mentioned a Jordanian trucking company known as "Alia" paying kickbacks to Hussein. In response to this Mr Howard told the inquiry that he could not recall the information being bought to his attention, which was not unusual.

Security Council sets deadline over Iran nuclear program
{{date|July 31, 2006}}

The [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] passed a resolution today demanding [[Iran]] halt all "enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development" before August 31. The resolution was passed under Article 40, Chapter VII of the {{w|United Nations Charter|UN Charter}}, which sets the stage for possible economic sanctions if Iran does not comply with the resolution, but does not authorise military action. Iran's envoy to the UN has rejected the move.

The resolution, number 1696, was drafted by the permanent five members of the council and was passed by a 14-1 vote, with [[Qatar]], the only Arab member of the council voting against.

The resolution expressed "serious concern" at [[Iran]]'s non-compliance with the {{w|IAEA}}'s demand to halt enrichment and other activities and asked the IAEA director to report on Iran's compliance by the end of August. This is the first legally binding demand on Iran to halt enrichment work, and the first to suggest possible sanctions. The resolution says that "appropriate measures" will be taken if Iran does not comply, but does not explicitly state any threat of sancions. 

Iran's ambassador to the UN, Javad Zarif told the Reuters news agency, "Iran's peaceful nuclear programme poses no threat to international peace and security and therefore dealing with this issue in the Security Council is unwarranted and void of any legal basis or practical utility,"

Valery Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN said the deadline was meant to meet Iran's request to allow it to consider an offer made in June by the permanent five and Germany, offering Iran a "package" of sops in return for giving up enrichment activities.

US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld visits Brazil
[[Image:LocationBrazil.png|250px|left]]
<!--[[Image:Rumsfeld3 Brazil March23.jpg|right|200px|thumb|US Secretary Donald Rumsfeld during meeting with Brazilian Vice-President José Alencar. Photo:Marcello Casal Jr/ABr]]-->
{{dateline|date=March 26, 2005|location=[[w:Brazil|Brazil]]}}
Tuesday (March 22) the [[w:United States Secretary of Defense|United States Secretary of Defense]]  [[w:Donald Rumsfeld|Donald Rumsfeld]]   arrived   in Brazil for a visit with Brazilian President [[w:Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva|Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]], Vice-President and Defense Minister José Alencar,  and other top officials.

In a meeting with President Lula DaSilva and his Vice-President and Minister of Defense, José Alencar, Mr Rumsfeld discussed Brazil leading the UN military forces in Haiti, terrorism and narcotrafficking.

Rumsfeld told to AFP journalists:
"The United States has put forward four topics, which we have agreed to take up: application of a law to down [drug traffickers' aircraft]; [UN] operations in Haiti; drug trafficking; and the fight against terrorism, including Brazil's position on security in South America." 

==Joint Press Conference ==
Rumsfeld and Alencar held a Joint Press Conference in [[w:Brasilia|Brasilia]], the capital city of Brazil.
<!--[[Image:Rumsfeld4BrazilMarch23.jpg|right|220px|thumb|US Secretary Donald Rumsfeld  and Brazilian Vice-President José Alencar during Joint Press Conference in Brasilia, Brazil. Photo:Marcello Casal Jr/ABr]]-->
Rumsfled stated that the friendship between Brazil and United States is long-standing and highly-valued. He added that the US and Brazil were allies in the Second World War and partners in helping to shape key post-war institutions including the United Nations.

Journalists asked both José Alencar, and Mr Rumsfeld if they were concerned about Venezuelan President [[w:Hugo Chávez|Hugo Chávez]], particularly after his recent purchase of 100,000 AK-47 assault rifles.

Rumsfeld said:
:''Certainly I'm concerned. If one thinks about it, the discussion that's taking place,  as I understand it, is concerning something in the neighborhood of 100,000 AK-47s to be moved from Russia possibly to Venezuela.  I don't   know if it's firm, but I've read about it and heard it discussed.  Not just in the press, but bilaterally.  I can't imagine what's going to happen to 100,000 AK-47s.  I can't imagine why Venezuela needs 100, 000 AK-47s.  I just hope that, personally hope, that it doesn't happen.  I can't imagine that if it did happen, that it would be good for the hemisphere.''

The Brazilian Vice-President said that Brazil prefers not to interfere in the affairs of others: 
:''Brazil has always defended and will continue defending the self-determination of the different peoples and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries. Obviously, here in Brazil, which is a country historically pacific (peaceful), obviously we would like to increasingly deepen our diplomatic and trade relations with our countries, with the objective of achieving the common good.''

President Lula is scheduled to meet President Hugo Chávez, the President of Colombia Alvaro Uribe Velez and Spain's prime minister, José Luiz Zapatero next Tuesday in Ciudad Guayana, Venezuela.

The Workers' Party Secretary for International Foreign Relations didn't agree with the US Defense Secretary regarding [[w:Venezuela|Venezuela]].  He said that his  "declaration,  does not contribute to a process of stabilization of the  United States' relations with Latin America. It is  a kind of  mentality that, unhappyly, still is present in the American state, which  considers Latin America as an extension of its territory." [http://www.pt.org.br/site/noticias/noticias_int.asp?cod=33460] 

Rumsfeld praised Brazil's leadership in [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] operations in [[w:Haiti|Haiti]] where they have maintained order in the country after the overthrow of former President [[w:Jean Bertrand Aristide|Jean Bertrand Aristide]] in February 2004.

A reporter asked Mr Rumsfeld whether Brazil is ready to have a seat on the [[w:UN Security Council|UN Security Council]]. He answered by saying the Department of Defense doesn't have a voice or a role in that and the matter should be answered by the US President and the Secretary of State.

==FARC and SIVAM==
Journalists asked the Brazilian Vice-President José Alencar three if Brazil will declare the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as a terrorist organization and if the government is worried about the FARC infiltration in Brazilian territory. Alencar was evasive and he refused to answer the questions directly. 

Alencar said  Brazil repudiates narcotrafficking and that "if the organization adopts crime as an instrument for raising resources, obviously it is something that must be combated."  

Later he became impatient and said that he had already said everything he had to say. [http://www.embaixada-americana.org.br/?action=materia&id=3311&itemmenu= ], [http://www.mre.gov.br/portugues/noticiario/nacional/selecao_detalhe.asp?ID_RESENHA=119413] 

Mr Rumsfeld visited SIVAM, the Amazon Surveillance System. SIVAM, which was built by U.S. Defense contractor Raytheon Corporation, is an arrangement of interconnected sensors and radars  to supervise  both  environmental conditions and criminal activity in the [[w:Amazon|Amazon]],  

According to the [[w:Communist Party of Brazil|Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB)]],  about 60 activists protested in the Amazon against the visit of Rumsfeld when he was touring SIVAM.

Renato Rabelo, the President of the PCdoB released a note repudiating the visit of the US Secretary. "The Communist Party of Brazil repudiates the presence in domestic territory of the secretary of the Defense of the United States, Donald Rumsfeld. The undesired visitor  is one of the main expoents of the tyrant and imperialist  government of the United States", says a excerpt.[http://www.vermelho.org.br/diario/2005/0323/0323_rumsfeld1.asp]

Nigeria bill has Taylor implications
{{date|September  1, 2005}}

The [[Nigeria]]n legislature is considering a Bill that would permit the Senate to extradite persons granted asylum by Nigeria to other nations and organizations, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[African Union]], to face trial for [[war crimes]].  Under the law, the Senate would have the power to accept or decline applications for asylum as well as remit persons already with asylum to requesting organizations or countries.

If the Bill passes, it would provide the mechanism needed by Nigeria to lawfully extradite indicted war criminal [[Charles Taylor]] to stand trial at the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone|Special Court]] in [[Sierra Leone]].  To date, Nigeria has resisted repeated claims by Sierra Leone, the [[United States]], and the United Nations to extradite Mr. Taylor saying that they will only do so if called upon by a freely elected [[Liberia]]n government.  Liberia has its first national elections since Taylor's regime scheduled for October.

The Bill has significant implications in Liberia, where Taylor was President until ousted by the international community in August 2003, under an asylum deal with Nigeria.  The United Nations has maintained a peacekeeping mission in the country ever since.  In October, Liberia faces its first national elections since Taylor, and his influence, although against the terms of his asylum, is seen as potentially destabilizing.

The front runners in Liberia's presidential race recently spoke on the Taylor issue at a series of presidential debates held on local radio.  Although most candidates agree that the rule of law must be followed none would commit to handing Taylor over to the Special Court if elected.

Iranian president calls Israel ‘disgraceful blot’
{{date|October 27, 2005}}
[[Iran]]ians plan a nation-wide demonstration on Friday in support of their president's comments that called for the elimination of Israel. The demonstrations would coincide with the annual event called [[w:al-Quds Day|al-Quds Day]], where the Israeli control of Jerusalem is protested. 

[[w:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in a speech to 3,000 students in [[w:Tehran|Tehran]] said Wednesday there was, "no doubt the new wave [of attacks] in Palestine will soon wipe off this disgraceful blot from the face of the Islamic world." At a conference called ''"The World without Zionism"'', the recently elected Iranian president Ahmadinejad said the establishment of Israel was, "a move by the world oppressor against the Islamic world," a reference to Western military and political pressure.

Ahmadinejad won the presidency in June with a populist approach that stressed [[w:Islam|Islam]] and revolutionary principles. The speech cited numerous references to the [[w: Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] and included a declaration that, "As the imam said, Israel must be wiped off the map." 

Other similar remarks, such as "God willing, the eradication of Israel would soon be realized through the continued wisdom of the Palestinian nation," have drawn wide condemnation.

France and Germany have summoned the respective Iranian ambassadors to their countries. A spokesperson for the British government called the remarks "deeply disturbing and sickening". The European Union said in a joint statement that "calls for violence, and for the destruction of any state, are manifestly inconsistent with any claim to be a mature and responsible member of the international community".

Israeli Prime minister [[w:Ariel Sharon|Ariel Sharon]] said that "a country that calls for the destruction of another people cannot be a member of the United Nations" and added: "Such a country that has nuclear weapons is a danger, not only to Israel and the Middle East, but also to Europe."

The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] Secretary General [[w: Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] expressed "dismay" over Ahmadinejad's remarks. In statements released by his secretary on Thursday, Annan, whose plans still include a visit to Iran within a month, said he would "place the Middle East peace process, and the right of all states in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force, at the top of his agenda for that visit." The U.N. Charter calls on all members to refrain from threats or force against the territorial integrity or political independence of another state.

A U.S. state department spokesman, Sean McCormick, said the United States would not support the call by Israel to eject Iran from the United Nations. McCormick's response was centered on issues of the enriched uranium processing in Iran, the human rights of its people, and alleged support for terrorism abroad.

The U.S. has had no formal diplomatic relations with Iran since the [[w:Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]] of 1979.

Malawi appeals for further humanitarian aid
{{date|October 15, 2005}}
[[Image:Africa terrain.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Africa]]
[[w:Bingu wa Mutharika|Bingu wa Mutharika]], president of [[w:Malawi|Malawi]], has declared the massive food shortages in his country a national disaster. The declaration comes on the heels of mounting criticism from his opposition as well as church groups in Malawi that have urged him to do more to highlight the problem. Mutharika has also been criticised for denying reports of casualties from hunger-related illnesses. The [[United Nations]] World Food Program has welcomed the declaration, stating that he is finally acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The UN estimates that five million people will be in need of aid in the coming year.
[[Image:LocationMalawi.png|left|thumb|240px|Map highlighting Malawi]]
The president has noted that all 28 districts of his country are affected and that, in addition to the 300,000 tons of food being imported from [[w:South Africa|South Africa]], another 144,000 will be needed.

"We are facing a national disaster affecting the lives of our people," he said.

The food shortages have been blamed on one of the worst harvests Malawi has experienced in over a decade as well as the growing [[w:HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] crisis. Because Malawi is a [[w:landlocked|landlocked]] country whose economy is almost entirely dependent on agriculture, poor harvests can have drastic impacts on the population. Most of the country feeds themselves through subsistence farming. Additionally, during the mid-eighties and nineties Malawi took in over a million refugees from [[w:Mozambique|Mozambique]], which placed a significant strain on the economy but also opened it to foreign aid.

The United Nations has attempted to restructure Malawi's economy through programs from the [[w:World Bank|World Bank]] and the [[w:International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]]. 

Relief agencies have been scrambling to deal with the crisis. [[w:UNICEF|UNICEF]] Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Per Engebak has said, "The numbers of malnourished children are many times higher than the normal emergency threshold." 

It is predicted that the disaster will be worse than the humanitarian crisis that plagued the country three years ago. Admissions to Nutrition Rehabilitation Units, run by a coalition of aid agencies as well as the Ministry of Health, have risen by 25 percent.

Church groups in the country have been assisting in the emergency.  The Council of Churches in Malawi, which brings together 22 denominations, has been applying pressure to the government. In addition to the food crisis, Rev Matiya Nkhoma has highlighted the problems of political instability in the country.

The food crisis is not just a danger to Malawi. The UN estimates that 12 million people are in need of aid in Southern Africa.

IAEA Iran report leaked
{{date|April 29, 2006}}

The Director-General of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], has issued a new report titled "Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]" and distributed it to members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the Agency's member states, but notes that the report is to remain secret, stating that "unless the IAEA Board of Governors and Security Council decide otherwise, the Agency cannot authorise its release to the public."

Iran is presently neither a member of the UN Security Council nor of the IAEA Board of Governors. 

As of 20:52, 29 April 2006 (UTC) or earlier, the report was [http://www.payvand.com/news/06/apr/1242.html made available on the Internet] on the website ''payvand.com'', dated April 28, 2006. It is unknown whether or not the release was authorised by the United Nations Security Council or the IAEA.

The report's concluding paragraphs summarise the IAEA's findings: "33. All the nuclear material declared by Iran to the Agency is accounted for. Apart from the small quantities previously reported to the Board, the Agency has found no other undeclared nuclear material in Iran. However, gaps remain in the Agency's knowledge with respect to the scope and content of Iran's centrifuge programme. Because of this, and other gaps in the Agency's knowledge, including the role of the military in Iran's nuclear programme, the Agency is unable to make progress in its efforts to provide assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. ... 37. The Agency will pursue its investigation of all remaining outstanding issues relevant to Iran's nuclear activities, and the Director General will continue to report as appropriate."

Australia silent on UN racism committee condemnation
{{date|March 28, 2005}}

The [[w:Australian government|Australian government]] has been keeping quiet about a [[United Nations|UN]] committee's repeated criticism of its record on race issues. A report issued over two weeks ago by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has not received comment from the government in the media, and domestic media coverage has been scant, as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald, and confirmed by a search of news search engine [http://news.google.com news.google.com].

According to Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation (ANTaR) National Director David Cooper before the case was heard by the UN committee, "We fully expect the government is going to deflect it by criticising the UN process."

In fact, this criticism was given in the session, and nothing has been heard from the Australian Federal Government since, on the committee hearing and report.

After reciting a list of Australian anti-racism initiatives, ambassador to the UN Mike Smith, described the 18 committee members' work in the previous session five years ago as "cursory" and "unreasonable". He said they had largely ignored progress being made in Australia, yet displayed "an unquestioning acceptance" of critics of the Government.

Regis de Gouttes of France called Mr Smith "exceptionally rude".

Jose Lindgren Alves of Brazil told him, "As a veteran diplomat, this statement, with its language describing programs and attacks on NGOs, reminds me of the sort of statement from communist bloc countries and Latin American dictatorships that Australia used to condemn."

The committee was positive about a number of improvements in race-related issues in Australia over the five years since its last report. These were,

<TABLE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=CENTER><TR><TD>
* the criminalising of acts and incitement of racial hatred in most Australian States and Territories
* progress in the economic, social and cultural rights by indigenous
peoples
* commitment of state and federal governments to work together on the issues
* programmes and practices among the police and the judiciary, aimed at reducing the number of indigenous juveniles entering the criminal justice system
* the abolition of mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory
* the adoption of a Charter of Public Service in a Culturally Diverse Society to ensure that government services are provided in a way that is sensitive to the language and cultural needs of all Australians
* and the numerous human rights education programmes developed by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC).
</TD></TR></TABLE>

However the report contained a large number of serious criticisms, and a reminder that the Convention prohibits direct as well as indirect discrimination. Australia was asked to report back on progress on a number of items within one year.

The criticisms were,

<TABLE WIDTH=75% ALIGN=CENTER><TR><TD>
* that there was nothing to stop racially discriminative Commonwealth laws
* proposed reforms to HREOC that may limit its independence and hinder its effectiveness at monitoring Australia's compliance with the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
* the abolition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), an elected body of indigenous representatives, the main policy-making body in Aboriginal affairs
* a lack of legislation criminalising serious acts or incitement of racial hatred, in the Commonwealth, the State of Tasmania and the Northern Territory
* that reported prejudice against Arabs and Muslims had increased
* that counter-terrorism legislation may have an indirect discriminatory effect against Arab and Muslim Australians
* reportedly biased treatment of asylum-seekers by the media
* difficulty in gaining successful litigation under the Racial Discrimination Act in the absence of direct evidence
* that no cases of racial discrimination, as distinct from racial hatred, have been successfully litigated in the Federal courts since 2001
* reversal since 1998 of progress made under 1993's Native Title Act and Mabo case, with new legal certainty for government and third parties provided at the expense of indigenous title
* diverging perceptions between governmental authorities and indigenous peoples and others on the compatibility of the 1998 amendments to the Native Title Act with the Convention
* that proof of ''continuous observance and acknowledgement'' of the laws and customs of indigenous peoples since the British acquisition of sovereignty over Australia is required to establish native title
* very poor conditions of employment, housing, health, education and income for indigenous Australians, compared with non-indigenous
* mandatory sentencing in Western Australia, which disproportionately impacts indigenous Australians
* the "striking over-representation" of indigenous people in prison, and dying in custody
* that indigenous women are the fastest growing prison population
* allegations, accompanied by State denials, of discrimination in the grant of visas against Asian and Muslim people
* Australia's mandatory detention of migrants determined to be illegal, including asylum-seekers, particularly when it affects women, children, unaccompanied minors, and the stateless 
* that many have been in detention for over three years
* lack of access by many migrants and protected refugees to social security 
* precariousness of circumstances, and denial of right of family reunion, for many protected refugees 
* that the Federal Government has rejected most of the recommendations adopted by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation given in 2000

World climate conference in Nairobi
{{date|November 13, 2006}} 
{{Climate change}}

The [[w:12th UN-Climate Conference|12th UN-Climate Conference]] was opened in Nairobi on Monday November 6, 2006. 

The aim of the negotiations is to find ways of assisting the developing countries to adapt to climate change. 

The formulation of goals for lowering [[w:greenhouse gas emissions|greenhouse gas emissions]] after the [[w:Kyoto-Protocol|Kyoto-Protocol]] runs out in [[w:2012|2012]] is high on the agenda. The [[w:World Meteorological Organisation|World Meteorological Organisation]] (WMO) reported half-a-percent rise in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere during 2005. This rise is destined to continue unless more positive action is taken. 

The [[w:United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) forecasts crop failures, flooding and threats to freshwater supplies. Actions to mitigate the effects of climate change in developing countries include developing new species of food crops, constructing sea defences, planting vegetation, improving the water-supply infrastructre in vulnerable areas and increasing public awareness of the need to conserve water.

Some 6,000 delegates will discuss these issues 6 - 17 November 2006.
 
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) senior-level round-table discussion on International Technology Cooperation on Environmentally Sound Technologies will take place on Tuesday, 14 November, 13.15 - 14.45

Of special interest will be the new report from UNFCCC on how climate change will affect the African continent.

Sudan will welcome UN Peacekeepers in Darfur
{{date| May 7, 2006}}
The Government of [[w:Sudan|Sudan]] has expressed that the  [[w:Darfur|Darfur]] Peace Accord with main rebel group, [[w:Sudan Liberation Army|Sudan Liberation Army]], led by Minni Menawi, can overturn the previous rejection of [[w:UN|UN]] Peacekeepers. So far, only [[w:African Union|African Union]] Peacekeepers were allowed in Darfur.

"The Sudan government will be open for any assistance," Bakri Mulah, secretary-general for external affairs in Sudan's Information Ministry, said in [[w:Khartoum|Khartoum]], Sudan.

In [[w:New York|New York]], [[John R. Bolton]], the [[w:US|US]] ambassador, on Saturday welcomed Khartoum's new willingness to accept a UN peacekeeping force to take over from AU soldiers in the Darfur region. He cited the Sudanese government representatives' comments  to indicate they were now willing to accept the UN force. He said, " We view this as a very encouraging sign, the first positive outcome from the Abuja peace agreement. "

In the meantime, top UN humanitarian official Jan Egeland has arrived in Sudan to review the situation in the Darfur region. He is expected to visit southern Darfur, where fighting has broken out recently.  It is the first visit by a UN official to the region since the peace deal was signed.

He said that access for aid workers in Darfur was at its worst level in two years. "At the moment Darfur is slowly being strangled, it's dying in front of us, half of the population now has become war victims...so I believe, yes, we are turning the corner, but the whole world has to put pressure on the parties." said Mr Egeland, the UN's Emergency Relief Co-ordinator.  

Earlier, [[w:UN Secretary General|UN Secretary General]] [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] requested Khartoum to issue visas to his team of assessors so they could plan for the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to replace the 7,000 African Union troops later in the year. The AU troops, now running out of funds, had largely been ineffective in stopping atrocities, leaving millions to struggle in camps with little food or water. While details for a UN peacekeeping force are finalised, the US diplomat said the US had asked [[w:Rwanda|Rwanda]] to send in some 1,200 troops to supplement the AU forces.

In a recent development, an unknown assailant shot a Spanish United Nations Aid worker in [[w:Chad|Chad]]. She is working in the eastern part of Chad to assist the refugees from Darfur region. 2,00,000 refugees have crossed the border to escape from the violence in Darfur. She is in critical condition.

Bush likely to appoint Bolton during congressional recess
{{date|July 25, 2005}}
[[Image:John R. Bolton.png|thumb|right|140px| [[John R. Bolton]]]]
As the [[w:United States Senate|US Senate]] is about to take its annual August recess,  they have not yet taken action on the controversial [[United Nations]] ambassador nomination of [[w:John Bolton|John Bolton]]. With [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] gone and [[w:George W. Bush|President Bush]] at his ranch in Texas, White House press secretary [[w:Scott McClellan|Scott McClellan]], speaking unofficially, hinted that Bush might exercise his constitutional authority and post him to the U.N. by use of a [[w:recess appointment|recess appointment]].

The appointment would stand until January 2007 before it would once again become subject to Senate confirmation. 

The Bolton nomination was passed on to the full Senate for consideration on March 17. This was done without a favorable recommendation from the [[w: U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]]. 

Senators [[w:Joseph Biden|Joseph Biden]] (D-[[w:Delaware|DE]]) and [[w: Christopher Dodd|Christopher Dodd]] (D-[[w:Connecticut|CT]]) succeeded twice in leading Democrats to block efforts of Republican chamber leaders to bring the matter to a vote. Democrats raised questions on whether Bolton abused subordinates while acting in his role as undersecretary of state, and whether he tried to pressure intelligence analysts to issue reports that conformed to his views. There was also the question of Bolton's past criticisms of the body of the United Nations itself.

Democratic [[w: filibuster|filibusters]] demanded of the Bush administration that it release classified information regarding the involvements of Bolton in his position as the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security since May 11, 2001. In the past, however, Senate confirmation was granted him to fill positions in government posts on four occasions.

With a week to go before recess, there are no signs of a Senate breakthrough.

In 1998, former President [[w: Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton]] selected [[w: Richard Holbrooke|Richard Holbrooke]].  In what some have called "partisan bickering", Republicans blocked Holbrooke for 14 months, before he was finally confirmed in August 1999.

UN officials push for humanitarian access in Lebanon
{{date|August 11, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
A [[United Nations|U.N.]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] proposal calls for [[Hezbollah]] to move out of the south and into positions north of the {{w|Litani River}}, but it makes no mention of disarmament.

According to U.N. observers, a vicious battle broke out between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters in Khiyam, which Israel says is a Hezbollah stronghold.

The U.N.'s top humanitarian official, {{w|Jan Egeland}}, criticised both Israel and Hezbollah for hindering access to southern Lebanon, calling the situation a "disgrace".
 
U.N. Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] pushed the Security Council to come up with a plan by week's end, August 12 to August 13, for ending the conflict. In a statement issued early afternoon, Annan's office said he is working "very intensely" on reaching a resolution acceptable to both Israel and Lebanon, and he repeated his call to end the fighting and "save civilians on both sides from the nightmare they have endured for the past four weeks." "The secretary-general believes that it ought to be possible for the Security Council to adopt a resolution by the end of the week," his office said. 

Meanwhile, the United Nations warned of a major food crisis in Lebanon, saying that the displacement of nearly a million people has coincided with the country's main cereal harvest. Of the 915,000 people the U.N. estimates to be internally displaced in Lebanon, 45 percent are children, it said. Fighting has disrupted the delivery of food, fuel and medical supplies and devastated much of the country's infrastructure, and the U.N. said 100,000 people in southern Lebanon won't be receiving vital relief. 

The emergency coordinator for the U.N. {{w|World Food Program}}, Zlatan Milisic, said no aid has been able to reach areas south of {{w|Sidon}}. A relief convoy planned for Nabatiya was denied IDF approval, said Milisic. The main points of a resolution to end fighting between Israel and Hezbollah have been agreed to by the U.S. and France, diplomatic sources said. U.N. observers described again a vicious battle in Khiyam, which Israel said is a Hezbollah stronghold, during the Israelian advance to {{w|Marjayoun}}.

G8 Summit debates Middle-east crisis, WTO trade talks
{{date|July 17, 2006}}
[[Image:G8 2006 logo.gif|right]] 
The leaders of the [[w:Group of Eight|Group of Eight]] (G8) nations met over the weekend in [[w:St. Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] in [[Russia]] for the 32nd G8 Summit, held under Russia's presidency, to discuss the ongoing Israel-Lebanon crisis, the stalled world trade talks and other issues. They also met with other world leaders, the UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] and World Trade Organisation chief [[w:Pascal Lamy|Pascal Lamy]]. 
[[Image:G8 2006 Summit leaders group photo-op.jpg|right|300px|right|thumb|G8 leaders and other delegates gather for the customary photo-session (Source: [http://en.g8russia.ru G8 Website])]]
==Israel-Lebanon crisis==
The G8 leaders issued a statement expressing "deepening concern" over [[w:2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|the unfolding crisis]] as [[Israel]] and [[w:Hezbollah|Hezbollah]] militants operating out of [[Lebanon]] continued their attacks which have already killed scores.  

=== G8 Statement on the crisis ===
The statement called for the safe return of the captured Israeli soldiers and restraint from Israel in its military actions. 

The statement said the "root cause" of the crisis was the "absence of a comprehensive Middle East peace", but "extremist elements and those that support them cannot be allowed to plunge the Middle East into chaos,".

The statement noted the rising civilian casualties on all sides and damage to infrastructure and called for an end to violence.

The statement called for the safe return of the Israeli soldiers who were abducted in [[w:Gaza|Gaza]] and Lebanon, an end to shelling of Israeli territory, asking Hezbollah to make the first move to end the crisis.
{{wikipediapar|2006 Israel-Lebanon crisis}}

It urged Israel to be mindful of "the strategic and humanitarian consequences of its actions" and "to exercise utmost restraint, seeking to avoid casualties among innocent civilians and damage to civilian infrastructure and to refrain from acts that would destabilize the Lebanese government." It also called for an end to Israeli military operations, withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of the arrested Palestinian ministers and parliamentarians. The statement said that Israel "needs to refrain from unilateral acts that could prejudice a final settlement and agree to negotiate in good faith," .

=== Summit leaders express differing opinions ===

Speaking to reporters, the assembled leaders did demonstrate some differences in their views on the conflict. 

[[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]] said on Sunday that Hezbollah and its links with [[Iran]] and [[Syria]] is a root cause of instability in the Middle East. [[United Kingdom]] Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] said that extremists backed by [[w:Syria|Syria]] and [[w:Iran|Iran]] wanted to interrupt the [peace] process. Tony Blair suggested that he was keen to travel to the Middle-East personally in discussions with George W. Bush, but George Bush suggested that [[:w:Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice]] should travel there instead.

Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] had earlier termed Israel's actions as excessive and on Saturday said that Israel was pursuing "other, wider goals". He also told reporters that Russia has specifically insisted on dropping any reference to Syria and Iran as Hezbollah supporters in the summit declaration.

[[Germany|German]] Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] told reporters, "We demand first that the Israeli soldiers be returned to Israel healthy, that the attacks on Israel cease, and then naturally for Israel to halt military action."

While [[France|French]] President [[w:Jacques Chirac|Jacques Chirac]] said on Sunday that the G8 is calling for a ceasefire, the US Undersecretary of State for political affairs [[w:Nicholas Burns|Nicholas Burns]] disagreed and said that there was no push for one. Chirac had also expressed "extreme reservations about the disproportionate character of the Israeli reactions," but no such language was incorporated into the G8 statement.

===Call for UN action===
The summit declaration called on the UN [[w:Security Council|Security Council]] to draw up plans for implementing its resolutions [[w:UN Security Council Resolution 1559|UNSCR 1559]] and 1680, which call for extending the Lebanese government's authority over all of Lebanon and the disarming of militias such as Hezbollah. It also suggested that the Council should look at setting up a monitoring force in Lebanon.

The United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that Security Council members would follow up on the declaration and that starting Monday, work out a detailed plan for deploying a multilateral security force in Lebanon.

===Reactions from the Middle-east===
Israel later welcomed the Summit statement, supporting its call for Hezbollah to free the Israeli soldiers and halt rocket fire into Israel. Israel's Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni said that the international community has "placed the responsibility for the conflict on extremist elements," and that Israel "sees the path to a solution through the release of the abducted soldiers, a cessation of rocket fire on Israel, and full implementation of (U.N.) resolution 1559,". 

In initial reaction to the proposed deployment, Israeli government spokeswoman Miri Eisin said, "I don't think we're at that stage yet. We're at the stage where we want to be sure that Hezbollah is not deployed at our northern border,".

In an address to the nation, Lebanese Prime Minister [[w:Fouad Siniora|Fouad Siniora]] urged an immediate cease-fire and establishment of the government's sovereignty in all Lebanese territory with help from the UN. It requested humanitarian aid and called for international pressure on Israel to stop its attacks. Disclaiming prior knowledge or responsibility for Hezbollah's capture of Israeli soldiers, the Prime Minister termed Israel's actions as "collective punishment".

Iranian Supreme Leader [[w:Ayatollah Khamenei|Ayatollah Khamenei]] said yesterday that Hezbollah would not disarm, despite calls from the US and "Zionists" (Israel). Iran says it offers moral but not military support to the Hezbollah and has denied Israeli accusations that Iranian arms have been used in the latest conflict.

Syria spoke of a "harsh and direct" response to any attack by Israel. Syrian President [[w:Bashar al-Assad|Bashar al-Assad]] said on Saturday that Syria will put its resources at the disposal of Lebanon to help cope with Israeli attacks devastating the country.

==WTO Trade talks==
The leaders of [[w:Brazil|Brazil]], [[w:China|China]], [[w:India|India]], [[w:Mexico|Mexico]] and [[w:South Africa|South Africa]] and the World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy were also present at the final session of their three-day summit. 

They joined the G8 leaders in addressing the stalled negotiations in the [[w:Doha round|Doha round]] of the WTO trade negotiations. The talks were deadlocked over US cuts on farm subsidies, the [[w:European Union|EU]] cuts on tariffs on farm goods and developing countries opening their markets for industrial goods and services.

Timely progress in the talks is crucial as the US president's special authority to negotiate trade deals will expire in a year. 
{{wikipediapar|Doha round}}
G8 powers have asked their trade negotiators and Pascal Lamy to broker a breakthrough on the stalled talks, giving WTO members one month to revive the Doha round.

A statement released said that the G8 was "fully committed to the development dimension of ongoing WTO talks." and that "The Doha Round should deliver real cuts in tariffs, effective cuts in subsidies and real new trade flows,".  

"In agriculture we are committed to substantially reducing trade-distorting domestic support and to the parallel elimination by the end of 2013 of all forms of export subsidies a well as establishment of effective disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect as agreed in Hong Kong, the statement said.

The G8 also expressed support for Russia's entry into WTO in accordance with the rules that apply to all its members.

== Assistance to Africa and other issues ==
While assistance to [[Africa]] was top of the agenda at last year's summit, this year it figured in the final session attended by Kofi Annan and the [[w:African Union|African Union]] delegation. Mr. Annan cited progress in implementing last years plans, but said much more needs to be done. 

"Fourteen African countries have been given complete debt relief, eight more have had substantial debt relief. We've seen some progress in development assistance. For the first time in many years we have gone over 100 billion dollars," he said.

The formal agenda of the meeting included securing energy supplies, boosting world trade talks and addressing a standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Summit leaders approved documents on education and fighting infectious diseases, discussed high world oil prices and the state of democracy in Russia and renewed a pledge to combat the AIDS crisis, though no detailed funding plan for it was agreed upon. 

Bush also met with Chinese President [[w:Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao]] and discussed the standoff over nuclear power in Iran and nuclear weapons in North Korea.

A statement was also released reiterating the leaders' condemnation of terrorism and resolve to combat it. The leaders expressed outrage at the recent [[w:11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings|bomb blasts]] in [[w:Mumbai|Mumbai]], India which killed close to 200 people.

Portugal formally commits to participate in UN's force
{{date|August 25, 2006}}

[[:w:Portugal|Portugal]] committed itself to participate in the [[:w:United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL), in an announcement in [[:w:Brussels|Brussels]] today. The size and the exact form of Portugal's participation will be decided in the next days by the Portuguese Superior Council of National Defence.

"We assumed the political responsibility to accompany the European partners", Luís Amado, Portugal's Foreign Affairs Minister, said.

Luís Amado said that the government has been coordinating with President [[:w:Aníbal Cavaco Silva|Cavaco Silva]] and the [[:w:Portuguese Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] over the composition and size of the Portuguese contingent, with several possible scenarios.

"The Prime Minister has been in contact with the President that will convene the Superior Council of National Defence", Amado added.

The Foreign Affairs Minister refused to confirm details of the deployment, which have been speculated upon by the press, which advanced the possibility of sending of a mechanized group, a engineering company or a frigate. 

"I had the chance to announce our participation in this force, having started the constitutional procedures that will allow us in the next days to announce the exact dimension of our participation", concluded Amado.

Portugal currently has a [[:w:Portuguese Air Force|Portuguese Air Force]] [[:w:C-130|C-130 Hercules]] flying [[:w:United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]' missions, to transport humanitarian aid to [[:w:Lebanon|Lebanon]], and has deployed more than 800 troops in [[:w:Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[:w:Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[:w:Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[:w:East Timor|East Timor]] and [[:w:Kosovo|Kosovo]]. Another 200 troops are expected to be deployed in the next months to Afghanistan and East Timor to reinforce the current forces there.

UN reports 'grim picture' of human rights in Burundi
{{date|August 5, 2005}}   
[[Image:LocationBurundi.png||right|180px]]

Thirty-four summary executions were carried out in [[w:Burundi|Burundi]] during  July, says ONUB, the UN's mission to the war-torn country. The figures were announced at a press conference yesterday in the Burundian capital [[w:Bujumbura|Bujumbura]]. 

ONUB rights chief Ismael Diallo accused government forces and members of the hardlined Hutu rebel group Palipehutu-FNL of being behind most of the violence.

Diallo outlined a "grim picture", according to a [[w:UN|UN]] press release, with human rights violations taking place every day, and no arrests ever being made. The violence is continuing despite the success of recent elections in the country.  

Analysts have argued that Burundi is in the grip of a "culture of [[w:impunity|impunity]]", which perpetuates the cycle of violence. 

"For reasons of diplomacy, people are sitting at the exact same table as war criminals, and in some cases granting them immunity. If the atrocities are to end there must be at least some indications that justice will be done", [[w:Human Rights Watch|Human Rights Watch]] spokesman Stephan Van Praet told Reuters, following last year's [[w:Gatumba|Gatumba]] massacre.

August 13th will mark the first anniversary of the attack, in which 152 Congolese Tutsi refugees were shot, hacked and burned to death. Despite widespread international condemnation, no arrests have yet been made and a UN investigation has stalled.

An estimated 300,000 people, mostly [[w:civilians|civilians]], have died in Burundi since civil war broke out in 1993.

[[Image:Polio worldwide 2005.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Countries with polio in 2005. Green denotes importation of polio. Red denotes an endemic.]]

The [[United Nations]] [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] reported on February 15, 2006 that [[w:polio|polio]] had been eradicated in [[Egypt]] and [[Niger]]. There has been no reported case of the disease in the past year, leading officials to believe the disease is no longer present.

Egypt's Minister of Health Hatem Mostafa El-Gabaly said Wednesday, "Polio has been endemic in our country for all of recorded history. The best tools of our age finally defeated this enemy, who has been with us from pharaonic times."

The disease, poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio was reported in 16 countries in the past year. In 2005, 1926 cases of polio were reported up from the 1255 cases reported in 2004. 

=== Nigeria's boycott ===

In August 2003, prominent [[Nigeria]]n clerics called for a boycott of immunizations. The clerics called the vaccine a plot led by the United States to sterilize Nigerians or infect them with [[w:AIDS|AIDS]].

Immunizations started up after local officials ended the boycott in July, 2004. Nigeria reported having 782 cases of the disease in 2004, up 427 from the previous year.

Australia will help in East Timor if requested: Downer
{{date|May 10, 2006}}
[[Image:Tt-map.png|right|thumb|200px|Map of East Timor]]
[[Australia]]n minister for foreign affairs, Alexander Downer ({{w|Division of Mayo|Mayo}}, {{w|Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal}}), told the [[Australian House of Representatives]] on Tuesday that Australia would provide assistance to [[East Timor]] if the East Timorese government or [[United Nations]] requested it.

[[Northern Territory, Australia|Northern Territory]] member, David Tollner ({{w|Division of Solomon|Solomon}},{{w|Country Liberal Party|Country Liberal}}), who has long had an interest in East Timorese affairs, asked Mr Downer to update the parliament on "recent developments in East Timor".

Riots in East Timor's capital {{w|Dilli}} killed five people on April 28 following a march supporting 600 East Timorese soldiers who were dismissed for deserting following complaints of discrimination between those from the east and west of East Timor. The Australian government issued a travel advisory for East Timor on May 4, 2006 advising Australians to avoid the country.

Mr Downer today told parliament that there was no indication of violence against foreigners despite the warning still being in place. He continued by saying that the government was "deeply concerned" and would continue to monitor the situation closely. "We have, in a number of ways, strongly urged the leaders of East Timor to resolve quickly and peacefully the differences that there are and, of course, to do so with full regard for the democratic institutions of the country, its constitution, the rule of law and international norms of human rights." said Mr Downer.

Parliament also heard that Australia had agreed with members of the [[United Nations Security Council]] to conduct a new operation in East Timor. "Australia does stand ready to offer assistance if requested by either the East Timor government directly or the United Nations." Mr Downer told parliament.

UN reports Rwandan refugees repatriated by force
{{date|June 14, 2005}}

The [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|High Commissioner for Refugees}} is reporting that thousands of [[Rwanda]]n {{w|asylum seekers}} who fled to neighbouring [[Burundi]] over the last few months have been forced to return home. Trucks laden with people have been seen leaving the camp, and some people have broken limbs after allegedly jumping to avoid returning to Rwanda.

According to a press release, the UNHCR was denied access to the Songore transit centre in northern Burundi, making verification difficult. The camp was home to at least 6,000 asylum seekers until last week. The Rwandan and Burundian governments met over the weekend and declared in a joint press release that the asylum seekers were not refugees but "illegal immigrants".

"Nothing justifies the presence of these people in Burundi. Rwanda is in peace and there is no persecution," said Burundian Interior Minister Jean Marie Ngendahayo.

This claim has been criticised by the UNHCR, which has stated that it would be illegal to return the people without first assessing their claim to asylum. [[Amnesty International]] has also claimed that Burundi's actions are contrary to international law.

"The use of verbal or physical threats to induce people to return to countries where they fear persecution is in complete contravention of international law &mdash; in particular the binding principle of {{w|non-refoulement}}," said Kolawole Olaniyan, Director of Amnesty International's Africa Programme.

"We urge the government of Burundi to implement fair and transparent asylum procedures to establish the risks of return for every single person claiming asylum &mdash; as is their duty under international law," he added.

This action appears to be part of a wider crackdown on asylum seekers from Rwanda and Burundi. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), an international aid group, reported yesterday that their medical staff had been denied access to the Songore camp.

The Rwandan asylum seekers began arriving in Burundi in March. Their main concern was the {{w|Gacaca courts}}, village courts established to expedite prosecution of perpretators of the 1994 {{w|Rwandan genocide|Rwandan genocide}}. The UNHCR is also reporting that some asylum seekers "... said they were fleeing threats, intimidation, persecution and rumours of revenge and bloodshed."

The President of Rwanda, [[Paul Kagame]], has previously called for the asylum seekers to return home, stating that they will not be in danger.

"Gacaca is not intended to have all the people who appear at Gacaca arrested and put in prison. We want these people to show remorse and through that they will provide information and will allow people to forgive them and allow them to settle," he said.

A Wikinews reporter was in Butare recently talking to the locals. She says that the mood is generally supportive of the courts.

"People here believe in the Gacaca process. They say that people have fled now because the investigations are reaching their end and people now know that the are going to be exposed in the process. They have heard 'rumours' that may have been circulated by former leaders of the genocide &mdash; or there may not have been rumours they may merely fear the trials - that there will be reprisals and violence," she said.

Some people fear reprisals after testifying before the courts.

"Fear is also experienced by those facing testimonies at the Gacaca trial: the widows etc. who will testify against their neighbours. I have been told by several people that high levels of security have been put into place in villages to protect people from revenge attacks for testifying or for being involved," she added.

There are 8,000 Rwandan asylum seekers in Burundi, and nearly 7,000 Burundians in Rwanda, according to the UNHCR.

African Union summit: Sudan says no to UN troops
{{date|July 2, 2006}}

<!--[[Image:Logo of the African Union.svg|right|thumb|Emblem of the African Union]]-->

The [[w:Sudan|Sudanese]] President [[w:Omar al-Bashir|Omar Hassan al-Bashir]] has rejected an [[w:United Nations|UN]] offer of up to 17,000 troops to stem the continuing crisis within the country.

Bashir met with the UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] on Sunday at the 7th [[w:African Union|African Union]] Summit being held in the [[w:Gambia|Gambian]] capital [[w:Banjul|Banjul]]. In a speech to delegates from across the continent, Mr. Annan, who was born in [[w:Ghana|Ghana]], labeled the [[w:darfur|Darfur]] crisis as "one of the worst nightmares in recent history". But Mr. Bashir said he was concerned that a UN mandate would be seen as a "western invasion" that would attract militants and create a situation similar to Iraq.

Kofi Annan said that he hoped dialogue would continue on the issue. The current African Union (AU) force of 7,000 has struggled to maintain order in a country with over 2.5 million displaced citizens. There have also been accusations of rape by AU soldiers inside camps. 

In his [http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=2117 speech], Mr Annan praised the progress in development across the continent since 1997 saying,"Despite elections, many Governments continue to suppress opposition parties and a free press. Many continue to exclude certain groups from participation in public life. Many continue to practise or tolerate large scale corruption," in his last address to the AU. 
		
Also in attendance at the summit was [[w:Hissene Habre|Hissene Habre]], [[w:Chad|Chad]]'s leader until 1990. He will face trial in [[w:Sengal|Senegal]], according to an announcement made Sunday by the Senegalese president [[w:Abdoulaye Wade|Abdoulaye Wade]].

Habre is accused of human rights abuses during his reign, including 200,000 counts of torture. There has been much wrangling as to who should try the former leader. [[w:Belgium|Belgium]] initially stepped in to hold the trial, but Mr. Wade agreed with the AU that "Africans must be judged in Africa."

Former president Habre ruled Chad for eight years before being removed after an uprising by current president [[w:Idriss Deby|Idriss Deby]].

Syrian minister rejects proposed U.N. resolution
{{date|August 6, 2006}}

[[w:Syria|Syria]] has rejected a proposed [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] resolution, backed by both the [[w:United States|United States]] and [[w:France|France]], for a cease fire in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]]. 

Syria's foreign minister has said that the resolution is a "a recipe for the continuation of the war," and "adopted Israel's point of view only."

Syria has also warned that their armed forces are under orders to respond immediately if [[w:Israel|Israel]] attacks. Syria's foreign minister said that "If Israel attacks Syria by any means, on the ground, by air, our leadership ordered the armed forces to reply immediately," and that "Syria is ready for the possibility of a regional war if the Israeli aggression continues."

Neighbours of Niger also facing food crisis
{{date|July 26, 2005}}
[[Image:Starving Nigerian child.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Nigerian child starving due to nationwide food shortage.]]
A food crisis is threatening three other countries in the region of [[w:Niger|Niger]] &mdash; a country facing severe food shortages after drought and plagues of locusts &mdash; the [[United Nations]] Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has warned.

The three &mdash; [[w:Burkina Faso|Burkina Faso]], [[w:Mali|Mali]] and [[w:Mauritania|Mauritania]] &mdash; have been affected by drought and plagues of locusts that engulfed the [[w:Sahel|Sahel]] region of West Africa last August.

About 6 million are short of food and require food aid: 3.5 million from Niger; 1.1 million from Mali; 750,000 from Mauritania; and 500,000 from Burkina Faso. 

The United Nations &mdash; which has a Consolidated Appeal for West Africa of just under £196 million US dollars in aid for the region this year &mdash; is expecting to feed 250,000 people shortly. In May, OCHA made an additional flash appeal for $16,191,000 US dollars.

Over the past few weeks, the media has shown graphic images of the situation in Niger. [[w:Jan Egelend|Jan Egelend]], OCHA Under-Secerary General and Emergency Relief Coordinator, claims that the situation in the region prior to this was largely ignored by the international community, saying that: "Over the last few days, the world has finally woken up, but it took graphic images of dying children for this to happen."

UN calls for further Syrian cooperation
{{date|October 31, 2005}}

This Tuesday the fifteen-member [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously adopted a resolution calling for [[Syria]] to cooperate fully with the UN International Independent Investigation Commission (UNIIIC).  The Security Council demanded that Syria detain suspects indentified by the UNIIC until such time as they could be questioned.  The resolution warns of "further action" if Syria fails to cooperate with the investigation.

Ministers from the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[France|France]], were circulating a draft of the resolution with stronger wording on action in the event that Syria failed to cooperate.  After the vote US Secretary of State, [[Condoleezza Rice]], said: "With our decision today, we show that Syria has isolated itself from the international community through its false statements, its support for terrorism, its interference in the affairs of its neighbours and its destabilising behaviour in the Middle East."

[[Russia]] and [[China]] had signaled they opposed wording the resolution in a way that threatened sanctions.  Chinese Foreign Minister {{w|Li Zhaoxing}}, told the council, "The commission itself believes that the investigation is yet to be completed and there is no final conclusion.  Under such circumstances it is inappropriate for the council to prejudge the outcome of the investigation and to threaten to impose sanctions." 

The final wording was endorsed by all 15 members of the Security Council.

Syria had earlier rejected the findings of the UN investigation into the murder of the former Lebanese prime minister {{w|Rafiq al-Hariri}}.

"It is a political statement against Syria based on allegations by witnesses known for their hostility to Syria," Mehdi Dakhlallah, Syria's information minister, told Aljazeera.

Lebanon: UN resolution won't end conflict
{{date|August 7, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
[[Lebanon]] warned the [[U.N.]] today that the [[U.S.]]&ndash;[[France|French]] drafted [[UN Security Council]] resolution will not end the on-going conflict in Lebanon. The conflict between [[Israel]] and [[Hezbollah]] has left thousands homeless and threatens more. The resolution calls for a long-term buffer zone between Southern Lebanon and Northern Israel. Also the draft demands full cessation of all hostilities but makes no mention of any Israeli withdrawal, which is one of the points of Lebanese Prime Minister [[Fuad Siniora]]'s {{w|Siniora Plan|seven point proposal}} for ending the crisis.

Mitri who is Lebanon's ministry of culture also demands a clear statement that Israel must withdraw.

Yesterday U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] was quoted as saying, "We're trying to deal with a problem that has been festering and brewing in Lebanon now for years and years and years, and so it's not going to be solved by one resolution in the Security Council." Rice also emphasized that the resolution is a first step for a better future in the on-going conflict.

[[Image:UN flag.png|right|300px|Flag of the United Nations]]
The Never Again youth forum on genocide prevention ended in {{w|Kigali}}, [[Rwanda]] with young people from the {{w|Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes region}} and other countries making a string of recommendations for the prevention of {{w|genocide}}.

Following the visit by the {{w|World Bank}} President {{w|Paul Wolfowitz}}, during which he promised to give the Never Again network his "moral support" and asked members about their views on what African youth needed, the network will send its ideas to the consultation for civil society on the [[U.N.]] High Level Panel to be discussed in September, which includes bringing in a new principle of Responsibility to Protect into the international framework of sovereignty.

Conference participants called for more local input in international protection work as well as for the international community to listen more to voices on the ground. They accused the international community of failing in their duty by not giving U.N. missions more power on the ground and using the "excuse" that they did not know local languages and therefore did not respond to incitement to violence towards Tutsis broadcast on national radio in the lead-up to the {{w|Rwandan Genocode|genocide in Rwanda in 1994}}.

Many participants criticised the uneven responses given by the international community to different regions. A participant from the {{w|Congo}} called for help to be given to "all citizens in the world, without distinction". Another said: "If our poverty [in Africa] is the cause of our being ignored then I fear for the future. Where there is interest there is energy and I fear we will lose the energy."

The final day also featured intense dialogue on regional conflict in the Great Lakes region and showed the different perspectives on the Burundi/Rwanda refugee story (link). Discussion groups looked at ways in which the youth could create better international networks and improve critical thinking and communication amongst the youth.

A media group took part in the conference and reported it for [[Wikinews]] this week. They will now produce a publication which will be translated into {{w|Kinyarwanda language|Kinyarwandan}} and distributed vocally as well as on paper as a way of involving young Rwandese from rural areas who have very high levels of poverty and illiteracy.

North Korea to accept international aid
{{date|August 18, 2006}} 
{{North Korea}}
In the wake of last month's floods, [[North Korea]] has agreed to accept aid from [[South Korea]]n donors as well as international organisations. This signifies an apparent change of heart the North Korean leadership, which as recently as last month had insisted they would handle everything itself.

Local North Korean sources put the number of deaths from the floods at 547 and a few hundred missing, however {{w|Good Friends}}, a South Korean private aid agency, estimates the numbers may be more than hundred times that and top 57,700 deaths. Good Friends, citing "many sources" inside North Korea, also estimates more than 2.5 million homeless and hundred of thousands of acres of farmland had been inundated.

Initially the aid from [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations World Food Program|World Food Program}} will cover 150 tonnes of food to feed 13,000 people for a month in North Korea's worst hit northern Songchon county. South Korea has pledged an additional $72 million.

In related news North Korean infant mortality reached 21 for every 1000, one of the highest in the world, mostly due to malnutrition and poor medical conditions.

Syria: Lebanon pullout is "full and complete", UN to verify
{{date|April 27, 2005}}<br>
     
Retreating soldiers, flashing victory signs, completed a withdrawal spurred by intense international pressure and massive [[w:Lebanon|Lebanese]] street protests against a [[w:Syria|Syrian]] occupation force that at one time reached 40,000. Masnaa residents of the [[w: Bekaa Valley|Bekaa Valley]] region danced, waved flags, raised banners and cried tears of brotherhood in celebration as they witnessed the last troop convoys passing. The Tuesday afternoon border crossing marked the official exit from Lebanon of the last army remnants, leaving 29 years of occupation behind.

Syria's Ambassador to the U.N., Fayssal Mekhdad, spoke to the press claiming that the pullout was "full and complete."   

"I have just submitted a letter to both the secretary-general and the president of the Security Council from his excellency Mr. Farouq al-Sharaa on behalf of the Syrian government confirming the Syrian full withdrawal from Lebanon in terms of withdrawing the troops, the security apparatus and the [intelligence] assets," Mekdad said.

The [[w:United Nations|U.N.]], acting with uncertainty that withdrawal claims are true, will work to check them. A U.N. team sent for this purpose has already begun work in [[w:Damascus|Damascus]]. A spokesman said the group would first gather material in the Syrian capital, then later leave for the Lebanese capital in [[w:Beirut|Beirut]].

U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, addressing the Security Countil in New York, expressed some doubts about the completeness of Syria's implementation of the council's decisions.  "As of April 26, 2005, the requirements of Resolution 1559 have not yet been met," Annan said.  "There has been no progress in the implementation of other provisions of the resolution," he added, stating that some member states had informed him that Syrian intelligence troops might be taking up new positions south of Beirut. 
     
Verifying the troop withdrawal will be fairly simple. The more difficult task will be identifying whether all intelligence assets are gone. These are not the uniformed groups, but members of the security services found at all levels of Lebanese society; in social, political and military echelons.
[[Image:LocationLebanon.png|thumb|right|180px|Lebanon region map]]
The Lebanese government, led by [[w: Bashar al-Assad|Bashar al-Assad]], will need to make quick political reforms if his regime is to survive. The once-dominant pro-Syrian intelligence and security services are disappearing as the new governing forces have demonstrated they hold them accountable for past actions. The leadership vacuum must be filled.

Yesterday, the powerful head of the General Security service Jamil Sayyed, announced his resignation due to "changing political developments". Raymond Azar, the chief of Lebanese military intelligence, reportedly fled with his family to France.

A former [[w:cia|CIA]] operative in Lebanon and the Middle East, Bob Baer said, "[The Syrians] are going to lose day-to-day control over Lebanon, once they don't have the T-72 tanks and the military there to back up the intelligence units," according to [[w:United Press International|UPI]].

But the close relationship that comes with their national proximity to each other and their intertwined destinies is evident from their parting formalities and festivities.

A Tuesday morning joint Lebanese-Syrian military gathering at Bekaa's air base in Riyaq bid farewell to the nearly 500 remaining troops and intelligence officers. Attended by military attachés and dignitaries from several countries, including the [[w:United States|United States]], [[w:France|France]] and [[w:North Korea|North Korea]]. Medals were exchanged and both Lebanese and Syrian military bands played anthems.

In the largely symbolic ceremony, commander of the Lebanese Army Gen. Michel Suleiman said, "Brothers in arms, thank you for your sacrifices. Together we shall always remain brothers in arms in the face of the Israeli enemy."

North Korea claims it has conducted a nuclear test
{{date|October 9, 2006}}
{{North Korea nuclear program}}
According to South Korea-based Yonhap News service, and the Associated Press, [[North Korea]] has announced that it has successfully conducted its first [[w:nuclear testing|nuclear test]]. 
[[Image:2006 North Korean nuclear test.png|left|thumb|Location of a 4.2 earthquake, allegedly caused by the nuclear test.]]
North Korea first announced it possessed nuclear weapons in 2005, though because it had not conducted a nuclear test its nuclear capability remained ambiguous. The [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[China]], and [[South Korea]] have all urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. North Korea released a statement on October 3 saying that it would soon conduct a nuclear test, and also emphasized that it would neither use nuclear weapons first nor aid other countries in nuclear proliferation. The state claimed that it would only use the weapons as a deterrent against the United States and its allies. In 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush and South Korean President [[w:Roh Moo-Hyun|Roh Moo-hyun]] said that they "would not tolerate" a nuclear North Korea. China and Japan have also expressed concern.

U.S. officials have reported that the government of the [[w:People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China]] was given a 20-minute advance warning that the test was about to occur. The PRC sent an emergency alert to Washington through the United States embassy in Beijing and President [[w:George W. Bush|George W. Bush]] was told shortly after 10 p.m. that a test was imminent by National Security Advisor [[w:Stephen Hadley|Stephen Hadley]].

Rumors of an impending nuclear test have circulated since North Korea announced its weapons capability. The [[w:Natural Resources Defense Council|Natural Resources Defense Council]] estimates that North Korea may have up to 10 or 12 nuclear devices already built.

According to North Korea's Central News Agency, the country conducted an underground nuclear test successfully without any radioactive leakage. Underground tests, if they fully contain the nuclear blast, can result in a minimum of nuclear fallout contamination. If confirmed, the nuclear test by North Korea would be the first nuclear test since the dual Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests of 1998.

The U.S. Geological Service has recorded a [[w:Richter magnitude scale|magnitude 4.2]] event in eastern North Korea at 01:35:27 (UTC), or 10:35:27 North Korean local time.

U.S. President George W Bush speaking at the [[w:White House|White House]] ahead of an emergency closed session of the [[W:UN Security Council|UN Security Council]] called the action "unacceptable ... North Korea has defied the will of the international community and the international community will respond." He also described it as "a threat to international peace and security. The United States condemns this provocative act."

Bush contacted the leaders of Russia, China, Japan and South Korea, the other nations that have been engaged in negotiations with North Korea. All have already denounced the action. China using the harshest language yet against its old war time ally, calling the test "brazen". Japan's Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] insisted on "decisive action."

Some experts are speculating that the test may push the United Nations to back sanctions against the North Koreans, Japan's U.N Ambassador [[w:Kenzo Oshima|Kenzo Oshima]] has told reporters in New York that the United States is drafting the resolutions, which could range from trade restrictions to monetary dealings and even a sea based blockade. The sitting members have strongly condemned the nuclear test.

In the first significant reaction to the announcement the South Korean government has decided to suspend a scheduled shipment of its emergency relief aid to its northern neighbor.  An official from the Unification Ministry said "A ship was scheduled to depart ... carrying 4,000 tons of concrete on Tuesday, but we decided to delay the shipment under the current circumstances."

The yield of the device has not been conclusively confirmed. [[w:Fox News|Fox News]] has reported the yield at below 4 kilotons, citing a unspecified senior Bush administration official; however, Russian military sources estimate the yield as between 5-15 kilotons. The Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources stated its estimate of the yield as 550 tons, but later scaled it up to 800 tons.

A senior seismologist at the Australian Seismology Research Centre said that a 4.2 magnitude quake would roughly correspond with a one kiloton explosion, but would not say it was conclusive, since it depends on the type of rock that the test was set off in.

It has been reported that the Korea Exchange, South Korea's main stock exchange, suspended trading for five minutes upon hearing news of the test.

Strongest earthquake in 40 years hits Southeast Asia
{{date|December 26, 2004}}
[[File:2004 Indonesia Tsunami.gif|framed|Animation of Indonesia tsunami (Credit: [[w:NOAA|NOAA]])]]
[[w:Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean]] - The death toll continues to grow and millions face a homeless life in the new year as coastal communities in south Asia struggle against continued aftershocks and flooding caused by the largest earthquake to strike the planet in more than a generation.

The [[w:Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] 9.0 undersea [[w:megathrust earthquake|megathrust]] [[w:earthquake|earthquake]] struck off the western coast of [[w:Sumatra|Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] on [[w:December 26|December 26]], [[w:2004|2004]], at 00:58:50 [[w:UTC|UTC]] (or 07:58:50 local time in [[w:Jakarta|Jakarta]] and [[Bangkok]]).

The earthquake was the strongest in the world since the 9.2-magnitude [[w:Good Friday Earthquake|Good Friday Earthquake]] which struck [[Alaska]], [[United States|USA]] in [[w:1964|1964]], and the fourth largest since [[w:1900|1900]]. More than 140,000 deaths[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/12/28/tsunami.deaths/index.html] were caused by resulting [[w:tsunami|tsunami]], which in [[Thailand]] were up to 10 meters (33 feet) tall, and struck within three hours of the initial event.

Multiple tsunamis struck and ravaged coastal regions all over the Indian Ocean, devastating regions including the Indonesian province of [[w:Aceh|Aceh]], the coast of [[Sri Lanka]], coastal areas of the [[India]]n state of [[Tamil Nadu]], the resort island of [[w:Phuket|Phuket]], [[Thailand]], and even as far away as [[Somalia]], [[w:1 E6 m|4,100&nbsp;km]] (2,500&nbsp;mi) west of the [[w:epicenter|epicenter]].

''While the earthquake and the tsunamis are no longer ongoing (other than aftershocks), the humanitarian and economic crisis generated by the disaster is still ongoing. This report will attempt to cover the crisis as it continues to develop.''

The [[w:Richter magnitude scale|great]] earthquake triggered massive tsunamis (popularly known as "tidal waves"), which struck the coasts of the [[w:Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean]].  However [[w:Pacific Ocean|Pacific Ocean]] coasts were not affected.

The Aceh province of Indonesia is the most affected. Officials in Sri Lanka estimate the death toll to be over 40,000. Much of the capital Colombo is flooded and high number of casualties are feared in the North East of the country around the town of Trincomalee. The New York Times estimated that at least 2 hours passed from the time of the earthquake before the island was affected. The tragedy has caused at least some Sri Lankans to ask what precautions could have allowed more people to avoid harm.

In India, the islands of Andaman and Nicobar and the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are the most affected. The police have said that there are 100 dead in Chennai city alone. Mild tremors were experienced in Chennai, Bangalore and Cochin cities. The Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh has expressed concern over the disaster and said that all directions were given to the different agencies including the Navy for quick relief work. The meteorological department has warned people in coastal areas in southern India to stay away as there are possibilities of more waves due to after-shocks for the next 3 to 4 days.[http://us.rediff.com/news/2004/dec/26quake.htm]

In addition to the large number of local residents, numerous tourists vacationing during the busy [[w:Christmas|Christmas]] holiday travel season were among the victims. In a press conference on December 31, [[Sweden|Swedish]] prime minister [[w:Göran Persson|Göran Persson]] reported that the number of Swedes that are confirmed dead is 59 and the number of missing Swedes is 3 559. Most of these were on vacation in Thailand, primarily in Khao Lak and Phi Phi Island.

As of December 31, 2004, the death toll is estimated by the United Nations to be up to 150,000. However, water-borne diseases are expected to kill nearly twice as many people.

==Quake characteristics==
[[File:Neic slav fig72narrow.jpg|frame|right|[[:Image:Neic_slav_fig72.jpg|Map of activity along India and Burma plates with detailed legend]]]]
The quake was initially reported at magnitude 6.8 but soon upgraded to 8.5, and then 8.9 and finally 9.0.  The largest recorded earthquake was the [[w:Great Chilean Earthquake|Great Chilean Earthquake]] of [[w:1960|1960]], at magnitude 9.5.

The [[w:hypocenter|hypocenter]] was measured at 3.298°N, 95.779°E, some 160 kilometres west of Sumatra, at a depth of 10 [[w:kilometre|km]] underwater, within the "[[w:Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]]" zone of frequent earthquakes.

The quake was felt as far away as [[w:Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[w:India|India]], [[w:Myanmar|Myanmar]], [[w:Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[w:Maledives|Maledives]] [[w:Singapore|Singapore]] and [[w:Thailand|Thailand]].

The earthquake was unusually large in geographical extent. [[w:1 E6 m|1,125&nbsp;km]] (700&nbsp;mi) of [[w:geologic fault|faultline]] slipped [[w:1 E1 m|15&nbsp;m]] (50&nbsp;ft) along the [[w:subduction zone|subduction zone]] where the [[w:India Plate|India Plate]] dives under the [[w:Burma Plate|Burma Plate]]. This formed a shock wave in the Indian Ocean, creating tsunamis that traveled at up to 800&nbsp;[[w:Kilometre per hour|km/h]] (500&nbsp;[[w:Miles per hour|mi/h]]). 

Numerous aftershocks of between magnitude 5.7 and 6.1 were reported off the [[w:Andaman Islands|Andaman Islands]] in the following hours.  Aftershocks off the [[w:Nicobar Islands|Nicobar Islands]] were also reported, including ones of magnitude 7.3 [http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/Quakes/ussmax.htm], and 6.5 [http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/Quakes/ussmbj.htm].  (See [http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/Quakes/quakes_all.html USGS current earthquake information].)

Based on one seismic model, some of the smaller islands southwest of Sumatra have moved southwest up to 20 m (66 ft).  The northern tip of Sumatra, which is on the Burma Plate as opposed to the southern regions on the Sunda Plate, may also have moved southwest up to 36 m (120 ft).  Other models suggest that most of the movement would have been vertical rather than lateral.  Further measurement is needed to determine the nature of the actual movement.  The massive release of energy and shift in mass also caused the earth to wobble slightly on its axis.
[http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/afp/20041228/wl_asia_afp/asiaquakeusmapshift_041228013319]

One year ago to this day, over 30,000 Iranians were killed by an earthquake with a 6.6 magnitude. The Indian Ocean Earthquake came just three days after a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in a completely uninhabited region off [[w:Macquarie Island|Macquarie Island]] near [[w:Antarctica|Antarctica]].

Earthquakes above magnitude 9 occur, on average, only about once every twenty years.

==Post-tsunami humanitarian situation==
Large amounts of humanitarian aid are needed due to widespread damage to infrastructure, food and water shortages and economic damage to the fishing and tourism industries. Epidemics are of special concern, as they are highly likely due to the high population density and tropical climate of the affected areas.  The United Nations has stated that the largest relief operation in history is underway.

The overwhelming concern of humanitarian and government agencies is to quickly identify and bury the dead before they become a health issue and contribute to the spread of diseases such as [[w:cholera|cholera]], [[w:diphtheria|diphtheria]], [[w:dysentery|dysentery]] and [[w:typhoid|typhoid]] (according to widespread but misguided belief [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1418740,00.html The Times]).  Other high priorities are delivery of medical supplies and personnel to overwhelmed hospitals and clinics, tent shelters and clothing to people who have lost their houses and belongings, and potable water.  Many usual sources of water were spoiled either by salt water, broken by the force of the tsunami, or contaminated with bodies of dead people or livestock, requiring water purification equipment or trucking potable water into the affected region.

===Humanitarian assistance===
Governments and humanitarian organisations around the world are scrambling to offer aid and technical help after the quake and [[w:tsunami|tsunami]]s that killed thousands of people in southern Asia and northwest Africa and caused wide-spread devastation. The [[w:World Bank|World Bank]] estimates the amount of aid needed at [[w:United States dollar|USD]] 5 billion. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4127433.stm]

Numerous organizations are also asking businesses and individuals to contribute towards relief efforts:

'''WARNING: Due the nature of Wikinews, it cannot guarantee the veracity of outside links and scams involving charities are a danger. Beware of organizations that have names similar to that of well-known aid agencies.'''

Darfur rebel leader signs peace plan
{{date|May 5, 2006}}

== Agreement Signed ==

The [[w:Sudan|Sudan]]ese government and [[w:Sudanese Liberation movement|Sudanese Liberation Movement]] (SLM), led by Minni Minnawi, signed a peace deal to end three years of conflict. Two smaller rebel groups rejected it despite last-minute efforts to get their support. 

The deal, which followed intense talks in [[w:Abuja|Abuja]], capital of [[w:Nigeria|Nigeria]], calls for the disbandment of rebel forces and the disarmament of the pro-government [[w:Janjaweed|Janjaweed]] militia. The conflict had killed about 200,000 and left about two million homeless. The accord, initiated by the [[w:African Union|African Union]], was reached after two years of negotiations.

"I accept the document with some reservations concerning the power sharing," Mr Minnawi said. The SLM are the largest rebel group in the [[w:Darfur|Darfur]] region of Sudan. One of his officials told that the SLM wanted more seats in parliament but had agreed to the deal to end the suffering of the people in [[w:Darfur|Darfur]].

== Opposition ==

Two smaller groups said they were not happy with the terms of the deal. The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) said it wanted fundamental changes to the document. The group's chief negotiator, Ahmed Tugod, reiterated the rebels' demands for the post of vice-president in the Khartoum government, to have the allocation of 6.5 percent of Sudan's national income to a Darfur development fund, and for greater representation in national institutions.  

"We decided not to sign it unless fundamental changes are made to this document, it did not meet a series of key demands." Mr Tugod said. 

The other faction of Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLM) likewise refused to sign it. "We need the document to be improved upon," the group's spokesman Abdel wahid Muhamed El Nur said. 

== Mediators ==

Rebel negotiators faced intense pressure to accept the amended deal, as diplomats from the [[w:United States|United States]], [[w:Britain|Britain]], [[w:Canada|Canada]] and the [[w:European Union|European Union]] struggled to find common ground. The initial deadline for the peace talks was Sunday at midnight, but was extended thrice. The peace plan was prepared by mediators from the [[w:African Union|African Union]] and was amended after the rebel groups did not agree at an early draft. International negotiators, including U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, [[w:Nigeria|Nigeria]]n President Olusegun Obasanjo and British International Development Secretary Hilary Benn, said the deal was the best hope for peace in Darfur.

== New Plan ==

The new plan decided to:

* Disarm completely Janjaweed militia by mid-October.
* Place restrictions on the movements of the paramilitary Forces and requires them to be reduced in size.
* Establish buffer zones around IDP [internally displaced persons] camps and humanitarian assistance corridors, into which rebel forces and Sudanese Armed Forces cannot go.
* Define the principles for integration of the rebel forces into the Sudanese armed forces and police.
* Integrate 4,000 former combatants into the army.
* Integrate 1,000 into the police.
* Support 3,000 through education and training programmes to assist in the civilian reconstruction and development of Darfur. 
* Provide strong rebel forces representation in the leadership positions of the Sudanese armed forces.
* Give the rebel movements the fourth-highest position in the Sudanese government of national unity; senior assistant to the president and chairperson of the transitional Darfur regional authority.
* Establish democratic processes for the people of Darfur to choose their leaders and determine their status as a region.
* Have a popular referendum by July 2010 to decide whether to establish Darfur as a unitary region with a single government.
* Hold Elections at every level of government not later than July 2009, in accordance with the interim national constitution.
* Grant the rebel movements chairmanship and control (at least eight of 10 seats) in the transitional Darfur regional authority. This body is responsible for implementation of the peace agreement in Darfur. 
* Allocate to the rebel movements 12 seats in the national assembly in Khartoum. 
* Allocate to the rebel movements 21 seats in each of the Darfur state legislatures. 
* Award to the rebel movements one state governor of Darfur, and two deputy state governors. 
* Allocate to the rebel movements senior positions in state ministries. 
* Guarantee the rebel movements key posts in local governments.
* Create a fund for Darfur reconstruction and development.
* Contribute $300 million  initially and then $200  million a year for two additional years to Darfur fund.
* Call for a joint assessment mission - modelled on the one done for southern reconstruction after the Comprehensive (North-South) Peace Agreement.
* Determine the specific reconstruction and development needs of Darfur.
* Establish a commission to work with the UN to help refugees and displaced persons return to their homes.
* Create a commission to provide compensation to victims of the conflict.

== Recent History ==

Observers said failure to reach an agreement would have been disastrous for the people of Darfur, who have suffered through three years of conflict that has claimed 200,000 lives and driven more than 2 millions from their homes. The conflict began in the arid and impoverished region early in 2003 after a rebel group began attacking government targets, claiming the capital [[w:Khartoum|Khartoum]] was neglecting the region. The rebels said the government was oppressing black [[w:Africans|Africans]] in favour of [[w:Arabs|Arabs]].

On the other side, Arab Janjaweed militias, drawn from Arab tribes, had been conducting a campaign of destruction with alleged help from the government. To flush out the rebels they had allegedly been targeting innocent civilians. More than 90 villages were burnt and destroyed, millions have fled their destroyed villages, with many heading for camps near Darfur's main towns. But there was not enough food, water or medicine. The Janjaweed patrol outside the camps and Darfurians said the men were killed and the women were raped if they venture too far in search of firewood or water. Many women were reported being abducted by the Janjaweed and held as sex slaves for more than a week before being released. Some 200,000 had also sought safety in neighbouring Chad, but many of them were camped along a 600km stretch of the border and remain vulnerable to attacks from Sudan. Chad was worried that the conflict could spill over the border. Its eastern areas have a similar ethnic make-up to Darfur.
 
Darfur, which means land of the Fur, has the history of tensions for many years over land and grazing rights between the mostly nomadic Arabs, and farmers from the Fur, Massaleet and Zagawa communities. 

Human rights groups said that genocide was taking place, though a [[w:UN|UN]] investigation team sent to Sudan said that while war crimes had been committed, there had been no intent to commit genocide. In April 2006, the [[w:UN Security Council|UN Security Council]] passed a resolution imposing sanctions against four Sudanese nationals accused of war crimes in Darfur that include two rebel leaders, a former air force chief, and a Janjaweed militia leader. 

Sudan's government denied being in control of the Janjaweed and President Omar al-Bashir called them "thieves and gangsters". After strong international pressure and the threat of sanctions, the government promised to disarm the Janjaweed. But so far there was little evidence that this had been implemented. Thousands of extra policemen were deployed but the refugees had little faith in the Sudanese security forces. Some 7,000 African Union troops had slowly been deployed in Darfur on a very limited mandate. Experts said the soldiers were too few to cover the whole area, and the African Union said it did not have the money to fund the operation for much longer. Sudan was unhappy with suggestions that the UN take control of the peacekeeping mission. 

Many aid agencies working in Darfur were unable to get access to vast areas because of the fighting. They said a peace agreement is vital before the rainy season begins in June when planting of food crops must be completed. United Nations officials, meanwhile, warned that they would be unable to provide food and other aid to the more than two million people living in refugee camps unless the security situation improves.

Angola: Marburg virus still spreading, 180 dead
{{date|April 9, 2005}}
[[Image:Flag of Angola.svg|thumb|right|The UN health body needs US$2.4 million to support the Ministry of Health in Angola.]]
[[w:Marburg virus|Marburg virus]] is still spreading in Angola, and 180 are now dead, according to recent information from the [[w:World Health Organisation|World Health Organisation (WHO)]]. [http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_04_08a/en/] The disease is similar to the [[w:Ebola|Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever]] (EHF) virus in its symptoms, though less deadly and slower to spread &mdash; which has lead to more deaths overall. Because Marburg kills more slowly, a victim has more time to make contact with potential hosts.

The incurable, though not always fatal, disease is passed on by contact with bodily fluids, including spit and blood. Victims bleed to death.

As of yesterday, 205 cases had been identified, with at least 180 fatalities. The disease is now present in seven of Angola's provinces, the latest outbreak occurring in Zaire province with six cases. The proportion of deaths in this outbreak was unusually high. [http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=healthNews&storyID=8127706]

According to the WHO, "The dramatic symptoms of Marburg haemorrhagic fever and its frequent fatality are resulting in a high level of fear, which is further aggravated by a lack of public understanding of the disease."

Mobile surveillance teams in Uige, where the majority of cases have been located [http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=healthNews&storyID=8127706], were unable to investigate several reported deaths, or to ensure the still-contagious bodies were appropriately dealt with, after transportation vehicles were attacked and damaged by local residents.

Said the WHO through a press release, "Because the disease has no cure, hospitalization is not associated with a favourable outcome, and confidence in the medical care system has been eroded.

"WHO is familiar with such reactions, which have been seen during previous outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Two medical anthropologists are already in Uige and will be joined shortly by experts in social mobilization from Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mozambique. Public compliance with control measures is not expected to improve in the absence of intense campaigns to educate the public about the disease."

Provincial authorities were being engaged in an attempt to urgently find solutions.

WHO was appealing, via the United Nations (UN), for funding. The UN health body currently needs US$2.4 million to support the Ministry of Health, Angola.

Some 50 international experts were deployed in Angola, a country where 27 years of civil war has left health systems and staff unable to cope with a major epidemic, according to Mike Ryan, director of WHO's alert and response operations.

"The situation right now in Angola is not under control yet...This is still a health crisis at the national level and requires a profound commitment both from national authorities and the international community in order to contain this disease," he said.

Two deaths had been confirmed in Luanda, Angola's capital of 4 million, and six more cases were being investigated there.

Iran nuclear talks have stalled
{{date|January 13, 2006}}
{{Wikinews Today infobox}}
Senior Iranian diplomats still hope for a diplomatic solution to the current stand off between the United Nations and the resumption of its nuclear development program to enrich uranium. The National Security Council spokesman for Iran, Hossein Entezami, said Thursday on a national broadcast that "Iran still believes diplomacy could be productive."

The UN Secretary-General, [[Kofi Annan]] said after a Thursday telephone conversation with Ali Larijani, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, that they "are interested in serious and constructive negotiation but within a time frame."

On the one hand, the [[w:United States of America|United States]] and [[w:Europe|Europe]] have grown increasingly concerned over [[w:Iran|Iran]] and its decision to resume full nuclear research. 

On the other hand, the concerns about the failure of the nuclear weapons states such as [[w:France|France]], [[w:USA|USA]] and [[w:UK|UK]] to progress in nuclear weapons disarmament as is required by Article VI of the [[w:Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]], which were summarised at the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference, June 2005 by the [[w:Malaysia|Malaysian]] representative, Rastam Mohd Isa, have not been addressed.

Talks between Europe and Iran stalled late yesterday to a near standstill and the E.U. joined with the U.S. in its decision to refer Iran to the UN for possible sanctions.

"Our talks with Iran have reached a dead end," the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said at a news conference in [[w:Berlin, Germany|Berlin Germany]]. "From our point of view, the time has come for the UN Security Council to become involved." [[w:Germany|Germany]] is a state alleged by the [[w:Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Aligned Movement]] to be in violation of Articles I and II of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty due to [[w:nuclear sharing|nuclear sharing]].
[[Image:LocationIran.png|left|250px|thumb|Map highlighting the location of Iran.]]

[[w:Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice]], the U.S. Secretary of State, said that "Iran's actions have shattered the basis for negotiation."

When asked if military force was an option (in Iran) Rice said "The president of the United States never takes any of his options off the table and nobody would want the president to do that... We are on a diplomatic track and it's not on the agenda at this point to move from that diplomatic track." 

Rice's comments have added to speculation that if all diplomatic negotions with Iran fail, that attacks on facilities in Iran using [[w:mini-nuke|mini-nukes]] might be a possibility.

Despite the criticism from America, Europe, and quite possibly [[w:Russia|Russia]] and [[w:China|China]], to get Iran to reverse its current course, some diplomats and experts say that the process of getting Iran near that step may take a long time, and may never even work. During the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference, June 2005, it was said that getting USA, France and the UK to disarm according to their obligations under the NPT may also take a long time, and may never even work.

Iran's government continues to insist that its nuclear path is for "peaceful purposes." In a noted turn from Iran's use of aggressive language in defining their position on politically sensitive issue, Entezami said, "Iran pursues its nuclear research activities in the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency regulations and under the supervision of the agency. So there is no reason for challenging Iran's rights in the field of nuclear fuel."

Thousands demand climate change action
{{date|December 3, 2005}}

Thousands of people across [[w:Australia|Australia]] are taking part in protests calling on the Federal Government to ratify the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]]. The 'Walk Against Warming' is part of an international day of action in 40 countries, coinciding with the [[w:United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations climate change talks]] in [[w:Montreal|Montreal]], Quebec, Canada.

[[Image:Kyoto Protocol participation map 2005.png|thumb|300px|Participation in the Kyoto Protocol. Dark green indicates countries that have signed and ratified the treaty. [[Australia]] and the [[United States]] have signed but, currently, decline to ratify it.]] 

According to the Walk Against Warming group, "the need to reduce greenhouse gases is at crisis point, we must act now for the sustainability of our planet for future generations."

Melinda Cook, Nature Conservation Council of [[w:New South Wales|New South Wales]] official, says governments need to take much stronger action on the issue of [[w:Climate change|Climate Change]]. 

"This international day has been called to put pressure on Australia and the US to ratify and to make sure governments are aware that the community is demanding serious commitments and action on greenhouse gas reduction," said Cook.

Siding with the [[w:United States|United States]], the [[w:Government of Australia|Australian Federal Government]] has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, arguing it is damaging to their economic interests. [[w:Ian Campbell (Australian politician)|Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell]] says Australia is focused on measures that should be taken after Kyoto expires in 2012.

"We need to do something that suits the developed world, something that suits the rapidly developing world, partnerships, technologies, economic mechanisms that drive us towards that," said Campbell. "We're nowhere near that at the moment and Australia wants to be a constructive part of driving us towards a very useful post-Kyoto regime."

Protesters across Australia are using the International Day of Action on Climate Change to demand the government adopt a clean energy policy. Hundreds of people marched through Sydney on Saturday to mark the day. 

The protest against [[w:Global warming|global warming]] coincides with the 12-day conference in Montreal, which will discuss climate change measures and future international action when the Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012. Australia and the United States are the only western industrialised nations which refuse to ratify the global Kyoto Protocol. Australia has delegates at the Montreal meeting, but will only act as observers.

Melinda Cook said scientists had predicted huge negative consequences including extreme weather and even social and economic impacts if steps were not taken now. Cook also said governments must make a "serious commitment" not to build any more coal fire powered stations.

The United States Bush administration and the Australian Howard Government have refused to ratify the Kyoto agreement, which pledges industrialised nations to cut carbon dioxide levels to 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.

'''Global Action'''

Up to a million people will take to the streets of more than 100 cities across dozens of countries today to demand greater action on global warming. Organizers of the protests say the world's leading industrialised nations had failed to make an impact on climate change and some, in particular [[w:Britain|Britain]], were backsliding on their environmental commitments.

The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] meeting in Montreal, will be attended by representatives of 189 countries. The centerpiece of the International Day of Climate Protest will be a mass protest in Montreal, where at least 15,000 people are expected to lobby delegates.

Across the planet, protests are being held in locations from Helsinki to Seoul. In [[w:Washington, D.C.|Washington]], drivers of fuel-efficient hybrid cars will rally around the [[w:White House|White House]]. In [[w:New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] - devastated by [[w:Hurricane Katrina|Hurricane Katrina]] in August - there will be a "Stop Global Warming" street party in the French Quarter.

"There is probably very little we can expect [from Montreal] because we are doing nothing to keep fossil fuel in the ground. All these techno-fixes are a waste of time if we continue to burn fossil fuel at the same rate," said [[w:George Monbiot|George Monbiot]], an academic and environment commentator, who will address a rally in [[w:London|London]].

"There is a lot of cynicism about what the British government is doing. [Prime Minister] [[w:Tony Blair|Tony Blair]] has promised much and persuaded many that he will deliver but it has turned out to be rubbish. Blair had no intention of doing anything on climate change other than talk about it. But this weekend's protests are taking place in a changed context - the media are listening and finally we have to make the politicians listen."

* Countries taking part in the global day of action include: Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Romania, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Uganda, United States, Venezuela...

Death toll mounts in Nepal civil conflict
{{date|April 12, 2005}}

As many as 116 [[w:Nepal|Nepalis]] have been killed in recent confrontations between [[w:Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Maoist]] guerrillas and government troops, according to recent estimates from multiple sources, including India's ''The Hindu''.

Approximately 113 bodies of Maoist rebels were recovered following a fierce battle between guerrillas and government security forces three days ago. The clash took place 550 kilometers west of Nepal's capital Kathmandu, when rebels attacked an outpost of the Royal Nepalese Army. Three government troops were killed.

Nepal's King [[w:Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] seized power on February 1 for the second time, in what he described as a necessary act to prevent the country from falling to the insurgents.  Gyanendra has promised that peace and democratic institutions would be restored within three years; however, he has currently suspended many civil liberties, arrested demonstrators, and used armed soldiers to censor the news media.

Nepal's army is under international scrutiny for potential violations of human rights, and some nations including India and the United Kingdom have suspended aid.  The United States is considering revoking its military aid unless the government's emergency regulations are ended.

The United Nations will be sending human rights observers into the country per an agreement signed Monday by Louise Arbour, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and Ramesh Nath Pandey, Nepalese Foreign Minister.  "Breaking the cycle of serious and systematic abuses [by both the government and rebels] will be the first essential step toward achieving peace and reconciliation in Nepal," said Arbour.

As the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' has reported, the rebels have brought about the brutal deaths of countless villagers, causing terror throughout Nepal.  More than 11,000 deaths are believed to have been caused during 9 years of violent conflict.

An army commander interviewed by the ''Chronicle'' stated, "We are winning this war," against the rebels. Reflecting on his statement, he immediately retracted this, declaring, "Nobody is winning," he says. "We are killing Nepalese, and they are killing Nepalese."

USA under pressure at climate talks
{{date|December 8, 2005}}

The European Union, Canada, Indonesia and other nations at the United Nations' climate talks in Montreal have put pressure on the United States. Participants at the meeting want the US to join the global Kyoto pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions, to curb extreme weather predictions from global warming. 

Environment ministers from over 90 countries are meeting to break a deadlock over how to entice the United States, and other large developing nations such as India and China, to cut production of greenhouse gases. Washington has rejected the pact, saying mandatory emissions cuts would harm its economy. 

The United States defended its policy of investing billions of dollars in cleaner technology to reduce emissions, brushing aside calls for it to commit to U.N. discussions on slowing climate change. 

At the heart of the Montreal meeting is how to cut emissions after 2012, when the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol climate change pact ends.

Iran stands firmly against nuclear agency resolution
{{date|August 12, 2005}}

In a nationally broadcast radio sermon by former [[Iran]]ian president [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] on Friday, he said of the [[United Nations|U. N.]] watchdog group adopting the resolution for Iran to stop nuclear enrichment activities, "The decision was a cruel one."

The Thurday adoption in {{w|Vienna}} by the governing board of the {{w|International Atomic Energy Agency}} (IAEA) was unanimous and legally non-binding in asking Iran to suspend all nuclear fuel related activities. The board also requested a report from the agency's chief, [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], on its compliance by Tehran.

On Thursday, an Iranian member of their nuclear negotiating team, Sirous Nasseri, read in {{w|London}} a statement made by his republic at the emergency governing board meeting of the IAEA regarding the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|Nuclear proliferation treaty}} (NPT):<blockquote>How can this body be called to react to an act, which is in full conformity with the NPT and the safeguards and constitutes a limited manifestation of the exercise of an inalienable right? A right, which by its own simple meaning, cannot be alienated from anyone. </blockquote>

IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming, said yesterday, "The resolution on Iran was just adopted without a vote, by consensus. So, full consensus. All 35 members of the board agreed to the language of the resolution text."

International concern over the Iranian nuclear enrichment program was led by the [[European Union]] countries of [[France]], [[UK|Great Britain]], and [[Germany]] (EU-3), along with the [[United States]]. The pressure brought by these nations succeeded in obtaining language calling for the re-instatement of seals that were removed at the Uranium Conversion Facility in {{w|Isfahan province|Isfahan}}. The seals were removed during the recent installation of surveillance cameras by IAEA.

The agency is to monitor {{w|Tehran}} for compliance to halt uranium enrichment. After a September 3 deadline, Iran again faces a possible referral to the [[U.N. Security Council]] where it could be subject to economic sanctions.

Meanwhile, the United States is likely to grant an entry {{w|Visa (document)|visa}} to Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] to attend the United Nations opening session next month in [[New York City]], [[New York]]. 

The [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration probe into whether Ahmadinejad was connected to the 1979-1981 {{w|Iran hostage crisis|Iranian hostage crisis}} is looking like it was a case of mistaken identity. The decision remains tentative as intelligence reports within the administration continue to circulate, according to ''{{w|The Washington Post}}'' citing U.S. officials.

Nigerian sentenced to death for admitting to gay relations
{{date|July 9, 2005}}
{{w|Philip Alston}}, an official with the [[United Nations]] is decrying a [[Nigeria]]n court decision to sentence a 50-year-old man to death by {{w|stoning}} after he admitted to having {{w|sexual intercourse|sex}} with another man. Reports have not named the individual.

The incident in question happened after the 50-year-old man was acquitted of charges that he had sexual relations with a much younger man. During further questioning, the judge asked the accused if he ever had sex with any other men. 

Upon answering yes, the judge convicted the man of {{wikt|sodomy}} and sentenced him to [[death penalty|death]] by stoning.

Nigeria, the most populous [[Africa]]n country, is one of many countries that has started to adopt [[Sharia]], or traditional [[Islam]]ic law as detailed in the {{w|Qur'an|Koran}}. Since 2000, 12 of Nigeria's northernmost states have adopted Sharia codes for their courtrooms. Under Islamic law, [[homosexual]] conduct is a [[crime and law|crime]] punishable by death.

"Sodomy cannot be considered one of the most serious crimes for which, under international law, the death penalty can be prescribed. The punishment is wholly disproportionate," Alston, {{w|United Nations special rapporteur|U.N. Special Rapporteur}} on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, said in  a written statement Friday.

Nigeria's southern states are mostly [[Christian]] and do not follow Sharia law.

Report urges Kenya to ban plastic bags
{{date|March 9, 2005}}
{{missing image|Image:Plastic bag stock sized.jpg|thumb|The ubiquitous plastic bag}}
They are cheap, useful, and very plentiful, and that is exactly the problem, according to researchers. A report issued on Feb. 23 by a cadre of environment and economics researchers suggested that [[Kenya]] should ban the common plastic bag that one gets at the checkout counter of grocery stores, and place a levy on other plastic bags, all to combat the country's environmental problems stemming from the bags' popularity.

==The trouble with bags==

The new report was a result of work by Kenyan government, the [[United Nations]] Environment Programme (UNEP), and the Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis. It evaluated the state of waste management in the country with particular attention to plastic bag pollution, and recommended that bags less than 30 microns in thickness be banned, a levy be placed on suppliers of thicker bags, and a number of programs be developed to encourage people in the country to not litter, but to recycle and use alternative or reusable bags for their shopping needs instead.

On one hand, the bags are often better than the alternatives, and are getting better. The Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI) in the United States quotes the [[University of Arizona]] {{w|Tucson Garbage Project|Garbage Project}}'s report that plastics are getting more compact and take up less space in landfills. Plastic bags compare favorably with paper bags which require more energy to produce, generate more waste and burn less cleanly, according to the SPI.

But on the other hand, the bags have gotten so thin as to be barely reusable and recyclable: grocers will frequently double-bag heavy produce, and the bag weighs so little that a great number of bags have to be collected to create an effectively recycled mass of plastic. The light-weight bags are easily picked up by wind, and end up escaping open trash bins and refuse heaps. By littering the landscape, plastic bags become a choking hazard for cattle; in the sea they hurt marine mammals. In {{w|Bangladesh}}, plastic bags were banned after they were blamed for blocking storm drains and causing flooding. Even if they do enter the landfill successfully, the bags take up to 1000 years to bio-degrade.

Plastic bags in Kenya are an especially acute problem. According to the report, waste management in the country isn't very effective, due partially to a lack of municipal trash pickup in squatter settlements and satellite towns outside the cities' boundaries. Less than 25% of the solid waste generated daily gets processed by a combination of public and private efforts. 

Sometimes plastic bag litter can have even further consequences. According to 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Kenyan Professor Wangari Mathaai, discarded bags fill up with rainwater and become perfect breeding grounds for malaria-bearing mosquitoes. {{w|Malaria}} is Africa's most deadly infectious disease in children, and over 50% of all hospital visits in some areas are malaria-related. Social costs of plastic litter add up as well: countries lacking comprehensive waste management often sprout underground economies of ragpickers &mdash; typically children who wander refuse heaps and collect potentially recyclable materials for sale to shady businessmen operating from official dump sites. The ragpickers in developing countries struggle with plastic bags, preferring thicker materials that require fewer items to be picked up for the same weight.

The problem with bags is that they are victims of their own success: they are so very cheap to manufacture that, at a cost of {{w|US$}}0.01 per bag, retailers often absorb the price of bags into the price of merchandise they sell. This makes the bag appear free to the consumers, who in turn do not value it, and toss the bag away with little reuse. In a vicious circle, the low cost of the bags drives down the amount of material used to manufacture them, creating bags that are flimsy and not easy to reuse.

The report places an emphasis on learning from the successes and failures of other countries' approaches to regulating the plastics industry. Several European countries introduced legislation that deals with plastic bags. In Ireland, a surcharge on plastic bags decreased their use by 90%. A similar move in Denmark saw the bag use drop by 66%. Australia and New Zealand have also considered or implemented some plastics regulation legislation. South Africa's plastic bag problem reached a climax in 2003 &mdash; plastic bags littered the street to such an extent that they earned the nickname "national flower". The country introduced regulations similar to those proposed in Kenya, and within less than a year a reduction in plastic litter was already apparent, according to the report.

The report also recognizes that policies require tradeoffs, and incorporates this into their recommendations. For example, the suggested policy of banning thin bags in favor of thicker ones seems counterintuitive: after all, the thicker ones contain more material that is the cause of the pollution. Furthermore, a ban on thin bags will decimate the industry producing those bags, likely resulting in job losses for Kenyans, as was the case in South Africa when that country introduced similar legislation. However the report notes that this will be offset by increases in production of alternative bags, or in the recycling industry.

==Making plastics==

The manufacture of plastic bags is a sizable industry. In the United States alone the film, sheet, and bag portion of the plastics industry produces more than $26 billion in sales in one year. The sheer number of plastic bags used are staggering, too: in Hong Kong more than a quarter of a billion bags get used every year, in San Francisco over 50 million, and almost 300 million in Kenya. The SPI &mdash; the parent organization of the Film and Bag Federation &mdash; claims that more than 80% of consumers reuse plastic bags as trash can liners or for similar purposes, but that's misleading even when restricted to the United States, as the number of bags used is still very high on a per-capita basis. According to the Worldwatch Institute, an independent environmental organization, Americans throw away 100 billion plastic bags every year, with only 0.6% of the bags being recycled.

The bag manufacturer association in the {{w|United States}} &mdash; the Film and Bag Federation &mdash; appears aware of environmental issues surrounding their products. The Federation's web site explores some environmental concerns, mainly recycling and reuse. But the issue of plastic bag overuse or excessive littering in developing countries is not addressed directly on their site.

Donna Dempsey, the Executive Director of the Film and Bag Federation, said in an email to a Wikinews reporter that "there are better ways in Kenya and other places to reduce the amount of bags used, such as re-educating the grocery bag checker not to double bag products and on the amount of groceries one bag is made to carry". She said that members of the association &mdash; companies in the United States and {{w|Canada}} &mdash; are investing millions of dollars into "bag to bag" recycling programs, which use material from recycled plastic bags to create new plastic bags, as well as programs that buy back recycled bags and turn them into plastic decking.

==Support and opposition==

The government of Kenya has signaled that they support solutions to problems caused by plastic waste. At the opening speech of the UNEP Governing Council/Ministerial Environment Forum on Feb. 21, 2005, Kenya's President [[Mwai Kibaki]] said: "In our major cities, plastic bags are used in large quantities at the household level. However, these bags are not disposed of in ways that ensure a clean environment. My country welcomes initiatives to address this problem." 

Prof. Wangari Maathai, who is the country's deputy environment minister, supports the effort from her official position. She promotes the 4-Rs &mdash; Reduce, Recycle, Re-use, Repair &mdash; and encourages the use of locally-made cotton or sisal bags.  Yet as the authors of the report write policy action must be fairly swift to be effective, so should the government commit to the report authors' recommendations it will have to quickly match political action with their words of support.

Plastic bag pollution has been a contentious issue with the people of Kenya for a number of years. Six years ago, the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya organized a campaign march to urge the government to regulate the bag producers. But not everyone is optimistic about the plans to regulate plastic bags. Dave Jones from {{w|Nairobi}} believes that the way to control pollution is to have clear policies on land ownership: "No single land owner would allow his property to be polluted by others" he writes in a letter to Kenya's daily newspaper, the Daily Nation. In {{w|South Africa}} after the bag regulations were implemented negative reactions included concerns that the poor already re-used the flimsy bags as source materials in producing home-made items such as hats or purses &mdash; occupations made impossible by the ban.

Brazilian general dies in Haiti
{{date|January 16, 2006}}

The Brazilian General [[w:Urano Teixeira da Matta Bacellar|Urano Teixeira da Matta Bacellar]], military chief of the [[w:MINUSTAH|United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti]] (MINUSTAH) died in the morning of January 7, in his [[w:Port-au-Prince|Port-au-Prince]] hotel room. 

Early speculations that the commander had committed suicide were supported both by a recently published UN report, and by a separate Brazilian police investigation. Bacellar had been placed in charge of the mission in August 2005, replacing General Augusto Heleno Ribeiro Pereira.

Since Bacellar's death, the post was run by a Chilean general. Carlos dos Santos, the director of the UN Information Center in Brazil, told Agência Brasil that a new commander is presumed to be named no later than next week.

The UN Department of Peace Operations, along with Kofi Annan and advisors, are evaluating which of the two nominees are best suited to the position.

Israel pulling back from Lebanon
{{date|August 15, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
The [[United Nations]] brokered cease-fire between [[Israel]] and [[Hezbollah]] is largely holding as Israel has begun to withdraw its forces from [[w:Lebanon|Lebanon]]. [[w:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|UNSC Resolution 1701]], which calls for a "full cessation of hostilities" in the [[w:2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|Israeli-Lebanon war]], was passed by the UN Security Council last Friday and was approved by Lebanon and Israel over the weekend. 

Lebanon's defence minister, [[w:Elias Murr|Elias Murr]], says that the 15,000 troops Lebanon has committed to the peacekeeping operation will be on the north side of the Litani River by the end of the week. As part of the truce agreement, they must cross the river and exercise control over what has been Hezbollah controlled territory in southern Lebanon.

The head of the Israeli army says the [[w:Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] could complete its withdrawal from Lebanon in 7 to 10 days. 

The new international peace-keeping force may number as many as 15,000, significantly larger than the existing force of 2,000, known as [[w:UNIFIL|UNIFIL]], which is expected to take up border positions in the mean time. The UN hopes for an advance force of up to 3,500 within the next 10 to 14 days. [[w:France|France]], who is expected to lead the international force, is seeking a clearer mandate from the UN on the rules of engagement.

Over 1,200 people have lost their lives in the conflict. 1,110, mostly civilians, have died in Lebanon and 157 Israelis, mostly military, were killed. Israel says it killed 530 Hezbollahh fighters while Hezbollah puts the toll at about 80.

Portuguese troops leave for Lebanon in October
{{date|August 31, 2006}}

[[Portugal]]'s Superior Council of National Defence (CSDN) decided Wednesday the composition of the countries' participation in the {{w|United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon}} (UNIFIL).

The decision reached by the Superior Council of National Defence yesterday evening will be to send a {{w|Military engineer|Engineering Company}} with 140 troops as part of its participation in UN's peacekeeping force in [[Lebanon]].

At the end of the Council's meeting CSDN's spokesman, General Goulão de Melo told the journalists that the Portuguese contingent would participate in the "reconstruction of the infrastructures destroyed during the war", adding that the duration of the mission will be established in agreement with the UN's established calendar.

Portugal's Defense Minister {{w|Nuno Severiano Teixeira}} said Wednesday night, during a news conference that the Company, based in {{w|Santa Margarida da Coutada|Santa Margarida}}, near {{w|Abrantes}}, will be deployed on October 14, integrating this way what the Minister considers UNIFIL' third generation forces.

"They will be on the ground but they are not a fighting force; they will be working on reconstruction so the risk they face is moderate", Teixeira said.

This confirms what already was foreseen by defence specialists, due the fact that Portugal doesn't have any adequate means available for the Lebanese Theater of Operations, and since countries like Germany and the Netherlands already confirmed the possibility of sending warships, a Portuguese offer of a frigate to patrol the Lebanese coast would become redundant.

Also at the meeting held by the CSDN the reduction of the Portuguese participation in international peacekeeping missions was approved. The Defense Minister responded by saying that Portugal already has manifested the interest in reducing its participation in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Also the reduction of the {{w|Fuzileiros Navais|Portuguese Marines}} currently in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] is scheduled to begin on November.

The Portuguese participation in the UNIFIL is calculated in {{w|Euro|€}}9.3 millions. Portugal will spend this year about {{w|Euro|€}}88.4 millions with all its international missions in [[Afghanistan]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Democratic Republic of the Congo, [[East Timor]], and {{w|Kosovo}}.

UN dismisses first official over oil-for-food scandal
{{date|June 3, 2005}}<br>
[[Image:Kofi Annan.jpg|thumb|180px|right|UN Secretary General<br> Kofi Annan]]    
[[United Nations|UN]] Secretary General [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] fired the first UN official in connection with the [[w:Iraq|Iraqi]] [[w:Oil-for-Food Programme|oil-for-food scandal]].  "After a thorough review of all aspects of the case, the Secretary General has decided that Mr. Joseph Stephanides be summarily dismissed for serious misconduct in accordance with UN staff regulations," relayed spokesman Stephane Dujarric. "Mr Stephanides was advised accordingly yesterday and separated from service with immediate effect.  There is no allegation of any criminal act. This is a disciplinary action for a breach of staff rules regarding procurement."

The investigation concluded that Stephanides infringed on regulations by helping the [[w:Britain|British]] company, Lloyds Register Inspection Ltd., win a contract under the UN programme for Iraq. Mr. Stephanides acted as the head of the Security Council Affairs Division when he allegedly told the company how much to lower its price to be awarded a contract. He denies any wrong-doing and hired a lawyer to defend himself. Aged 59, Stephanides worked for the UN for 25 years, and was due to retire in September this year.

After a first food-for-oil interim report was released in February, Mr. Stephanides along with [[w:Benon Sevan|Benon Sevan]] were suspended. Sevan, the former head of the oil-for-food programme for 6 years, was also accused of breach of procurement rules in the report co-written by [[w:Paul A. Volcker|Paul Volcker]]. However, disciplinary measures against Sevan will not be carried out because of his status of [[w:diplomatic immunity|diplomatic immunity]].

A final report is scheduled for publication in three months which should further clarify whether Mr. Sevan received Iraqi oil allocations for a friend's company. In the meantime, he remains suspended from all UN duties, and is being given only a symbolic salary of one dollar a year.

A central and unanswered question, is whether either Stephanides or Sevan profited directly by their actions in executing and implementing the complex programme.

Bad weather makes life tougher for quake survivors
{{date|October 12, 2005}}

While Aid starts to pour in to the worst hit areas of South Asia Earthquake that has killed more than 30,000 people, bad weather is hampering the relief efforts with snow falling on the peaks of the earthquake-devastated areas of Pakistan.

The measure of human suffering can't just be measured in the death toll, which officially stands at 23,000, but also in the 4 million who have been made homeless, hungry, and cold with 1 million in acute need, facing certain death without outside assistance. In the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir, authorities say at least 1,300 people are known to have died, but officials fear the number will rise.

ABC Australia reports of a man in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, who has been cut from aid, saying "I find that we are alone now. We have nothing. We are finished."

Choppers are the main lifeline of support; trucks are unable to deliver relief supplies due to looting and general mayhem on the ground. The more snow, the less able aid agencies are to make their way to those in the direst need.

Jan Vandemoortele, U.N. Resident Coordinator for Pakistan, said key roads into the quake zone have been reopened, as 30 countries including Australia, France, Japan, Jordan, China, Russia, Iran, Syria and the US provide assistance in the form of money, doctors, tents, blankets, and disaster relief teams.

United Nations officials are warning of a growing threat of measles, cholera, and diarrhea outbreaks among the millions of survivors.

There have been no reports of epidemic outbreaks so far, but the area's health infrastructure has completely collapsed, Vandemoortele said.

19 Burmese political prisoners released; more to come
{{byline|date=November 20, 2004|location=YANGON, Myanmar}}  Nineteen Burmese political prisoners, including pro-democracy leader Min Ko Naing, have been freed by [[w:Burma|Burma]]'s military junta after it declared their imprisonments invalid, the Associated Press reports.

The releases came after the current regime under Soe Win dissolved the National Intelligence Bureau run by Prime Minister General Khin Nyunt, who was ousted last month.  The Burmese state-run television and radio network claimed that the NIB had wrongly charged 3,937 prisoners.

Min Ko Naing had been imprisoned since 1988 after leading pro-democracy protests that were quickly crushed by the ruling regime.  In total, three senior members of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy were released.  Aung San Suu Kyi herself has been under house arrest since May 2003 following a violent confrontation between loyalists and her dissidents.

At least one NLD member expressed optimism about the new development.  77-year-old Ohn Maung, an NLD member freed on Friday after being imprisoned since 1998, told [[w:Reuters|Reuters]] "It was a pleasant surprise for all of us."  He added, "I did not have to sign any undertaking and I expect most of the NLD members will also be released like me."

[[w:UN|UN]] Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] released a statement in which he said that he is "encouraged by reports that a number of people detained for political activities are included among [the prisoners released]."  He also called for the release of all remaining political opponents and dissidents, either from prison or from house arrest.

According to witnesses outside Yangon's Insein Prison, altogether approximately 200 prisoners--most serving terms for minor criminal offenses--were released Friday.

Although Burma's military regime changed the country's name to [[w:Myanmar|Myanmar]] in 1989--a change recognized by the United Nations--many national governments and a large portion of the Burmese population still use the name "Burma" because they do not recognize the legitimacy of the junta that instituted the change.

25 more NZ police head off to East Timor
{{date|July 11, 2006}}
{{New Zealand}} 
25 [[w:New Zealand police|New Zealand police]] officers have left today, July 11, for three months in [[w:East Timor|East Timor]]. The force will carry pepper spray and pistols.

The police force will assist the 160 [[w:New Zealand Defence Force|New Zealand Defence Force]] armed personnel that are already in East Timor as well as other country's personnel.

Grant O'Fee, contingent commander, said "attempts will be made to establish good relations with village chiefs."

The police teams will try to prosecute those who are responsible for arson and assault following the recent violence in East Timor.

The recent two weeks of violence has died down since the former Prime Minister (PM) of East Timor resigned giving his post to the former foreign and defence minister, Jose Ramos Horta. This appointment has been congratulated by the United Nations (UN) Secretary General, Kofi Annan. Horta said the main priority for his government will be "restoring security and moving 150,000 people in refugee camps back home."

Peacekeepers take control in East Timor
{{date|May 27, 2006}}
[[Image:Timor oriental dili.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Map of Dili]]
The [[w:Australia|Australia]]n presence in [[w:East Timor|East Timor]] so far has been characterised by vigorous patrolling into the capital [[w:Dili|Dili]], with the main goal being to lock down the city in order to separate and concentrate the various conflicting forces in East Timor.  Despite the Australian military being provided strong rules of engagement by the East Timorese government, so far no soldiers have fired their weapons or been fired upon, although they might have been fired over by gangs earlier today.  Outside the Hotel Timor today, where East Timorese Prime Minister Alkatiri was about to hold a press conference, an Australian patrol arrested what appeared to be two gangs about to storm the hotel with the help of reinforcements.  The men numbered around 30, carrying machetes, knifes, spears, slingshots, and arrows.  The Prime Minister claimed that the gangs were attempting a coup d'etat.  Civilian gangs, allegedly provided arms by the East Timorese military, have so far been blamed for much of the violence in Dili.

As the rest of the 1300 strong Australian deployment is expected to arrive in East Timor tomorrow, Australian Prime Minister John Howard has said that although his government did foresee the current situation in East Timor, military action would have constituted an invasion until mandated through the United Nations' or East Timorese government's request.  "...People say you should have seen it coming. The answer is yes, I did, but until you are asked, it happens to be an invasion." said Mr Howard.  East Timor requested military assistance from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal on May 23, Foreign Minister Jose Ramos-Horta explaining that the government "...[couldn't] control the situation,"; all four nations responded positively to the request.
{{aussieissue|2006 East Timor crisis}}
Despite one newspaper running the headline "We'll stay till job's done, says PM", the Chief of Defence Force, Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston has said that he hopes the Australian military will be able to be replaced within a few months by a UN peacekeepers.  In any case, ACM Houston has said that he is believes the Australian presence will stabilise the situation soon, perhaps aided by the good relations that exist between the ADF and the leader of the rebel group, Major Alfredo Reinado.  MAJ Reinado was trained by the ADF for three months and has openly welcomed the arrival of the peacekeeping force, saying that the deployment is the "only solution" in the face of the government's inability to resolve the conflict.

After praising the speed of the deployment, Washington revealed that the US assisted the transport of Australian troops to position in Townsville and Darwin two weeks earlier.

Indonesia has now closed its border to East Timor, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono saying that "besides security reasons, the closure of the border is to prevent the possibility of issues that may worsen the image of Indonesia."

Iranian president says move Israel to Europe
{{date|December  9, 2005}}
[[Image:Iran map.png|thumb|250px|Map of [[Iran]]]]
In October, the President of Iran, [[w:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], called Israel a "disgraceful blot" to be "wiped off the map." Ahmadinejad further remarked Thursday at a summit of [[w:Muslim|Muslim]] nations in [[w:Mecca|Islam's holy city of Mecca]] that the Jewish state should be moved to [[w:Europe|Europe]] and questioned whether the [[w:Holocaust|Holocaust]] actually took place. 

In an interview with Iran's Arabic channel 'Al-Alam', Ahmadinejad said that if [[w:Germany|Germany]] and [[w:Austria|Austria]] feel responsible for the massacre of [[w:Jews|Jews]] during [[w:World War II|World War II]], they should host a state of Israel on their own soil. Speaking at a news conference on the summit sidelines, Ahmadinejad said most Jews in Israel "have no roots in [[w:Palestine|Palestine]], but they are holding the destiny of Palestine in their hands and allow themselves to kill the Palestinian people." The summit condemned terrorism and extremism, stressing the themes of moderation and tolerance.

"Some European countries insist on saying that during World War II, [[w:Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] burned millions of Jews and put them in concentration camps," Ahmadinejad said. "Any historian, commentator or scientist who doubts that is taken to prison or gets condemned. Although we don't accept this claim [of the holocaust], if we suppose it is true... If the Europeans are honest they should give some of their provinces in Europe -- like in Germany, Austria or other countries -- to the Zionists and the Zionists can establish their state in Europe. You offer part of Europe and we will support it."

Rabbi David Saperstein, head of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, called the comments a "repugnant distortion of history."

[[w:United Nations|United Nations (UN)]] Secretary-General [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] urged all UN States to combat [[w:Holocaust denial|Holocaust denial]], and to "educate their populations about the well established historical facts of the Holocaust, in which one third of the Jewish people were murdered, along with countless members of other minorities."

Tension between Israel and Iran began before the 1979 [[w:Islamic Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] when the Israelis joined the United States in siding with the Shah before he was deposed. Recent tensions between Iran and Israel over the nuclear activities in Tehran and [[w:Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Israel's many existing nuclear bombs and missile delivery systems]] have increased as a result of Ahmadinejad's comment.

"Just to remind Mr. Ahmadinejad, we've been here long before his ancestors. Therefore, we have a birthright to be here in the land of our forefathers and to live here. Thank God we have the capability to deter and to prevent such a statement from becoming a reality," said Ra'anan Gissin, [[w:Ariel Sharon|Israel Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's]] adviser.

Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said the statement should be a wake up call to all of us around the world. 

"We should do everything we can in order to stop him, and to stop the Iranian effort to develop a nuclear bomb," said Shalom.

"[Ahmadinejad's comment] further underscores our concerns about the regime in Iran," said White House press secretary Scott McClellan. "It's all the more reason why it's so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons." 

==Reactions from Iranians==

The [[w:Iranian blogs|Iranian blogger]] Babak Seradjeh reacted to Ahmadinejad's comments by stating, "I wondered why Mr. Ahmanedinejad doesn't provide the Palestinians with a piece of Iran. ... Such evil remarks in blatant [sic] disregard of documented history is nothing new of course coming from the kind of people that Mr. Ahmadinejad represents. Denying the Holocaust, calling to wipe a country off the map, or to move it, are all the stuff of my generation's childhood, in school, on the radio and on TV, in the bold and thick slogans on the walls, the streamlined propaganda that aimed to penetrate all the space it could find in our brains."

Another Iranian blogger, Shahram Kholdi, had responded to Ahmadinejad's earlier comments about "wiping Israel off the map of the earth" by saying that Ahmadinejad was calling for [[w:ethnic cleansing|ethnic-cleansing]]. In response to the new statements, Kholdi has pointed out that "His Excellency President Dr. Ahmadinejad's" new comments "clarify" Ahmadinejad's point of view beyond any doubt. Kholdi's response included the direct statement: "First, Mr. President, if you do not know history please Shut up!"

US Senators, EU voice support for Iran sanctions
{{date|January 15, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag of Iran.svg|right|225px|thumb|Flag of Iran]]
At least 15 [[United States]] [[US Senate|senators]] from both the Democratic and Republican parties voiced strong support for sanctions against [[Iran]] unless it halts its nuclear program completely, and at least one senator has hinted that military action is a possibility in the future. 

Senator [[John McCain]] (R-[[Arizona]]), said on CBS that "The United States should press for sanctions even if that led to higher oil prices." He also added that "this is the most grave situation that we have faced since the end of the Cold War, absent the whole war on terror."

Another Republican Senator, {{w|Lindsey Graham}} of [[South Carolina]], speaking on the Fox News Channel, said there should be "tougher measures." He also stated that "all options should be kept open," which could imply the use of military force. However, Senator Graham also said that "we need to work together with our [[Europe]]an allies."

The most well-known military action by the US against an elected government in Iran was the Anglo-American covert {{w|Operation Ajax}} in 1953 in which Prime Minister {{w|Mohammed Mossadegh}} was overthrown and the exiled {{w|Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi|Shah}} was restored to the throne as a {{w|dictator}}.

Senator {{w|Dianne Feinstein}} (D-[[California]]), said she "agrees with McCain's assessment of the extent of Iran's threat. Iran has much more opportunity to create devastation in the [[Middle East]] than [[Iraq]] at this time," she said. "I think it's a very serious threat." Regarding the need for continued international cooperation, Feinstein stated that the issue is a "major test of the international community."

On Thursday, [[Germany]], [[France]], [[UK|Great Britain]] and the [[European Union]] officially declared an end to negotiations with Iran, a move endorsed by The United States.

On Friday, [[Russia]] renewed its call for Iran to resume cooperation with the {{w|International Atomic Energy Agency}} (IAEA). 

"We again call on Iran to reconsider its decisions and return to the state of moratorium and implement full and transparent cooperation with the IAEA, as is foreseen in the appropriate resolutions of the agency's board," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin said in a statement to the press.

Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said "all efforts must be made to ensure the peaceful resolution of the crisis and that diplomatic methods had not been exhausted." He then added that Russia's "proposal" to move the final phase of Iran's enrichment program to Russian territory is "still on the table for discussion."
[[Image:Nuclear symbol.png|left|230px|thumb]]
[[Mohamed ElBaradei]], Chief of the IAEA, said in a press release today that he is so far unable to confirm whether Iran's controversial nuclear program is peaceful. "For the last three years we have been doing intensive verification in Iran, and even after three years I am not yet in a position to make a judgment on the peaceful nature of the (nuclear) program." He also added that Iran would only be a "few months from building a nuclear bomb if it has nuclear material at the same time as a weaponization program."

"We still need to assure ourselves through access to documents, individuals and locations, that we have seen all that we ought to see and that there is nothing fishy, if you like, about the (nuclear) program," ElBaradei said.

Iranian Finance Minister Davood Danesh Jafari said on an Iranian radio station today that "any Western sanction placed on Iran, in response to its nuclear development program could raise global oil prices... sanctions on Iran, could possibly, by disturbing Iran's political and economic situation, raise oil prices beyond levels the West expects," he told state radio.

On Saturday, the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said during a rare press conference to address the European Union that Iran will "consider using its control over oil prices as retalliation for potential sanctions on Iran." Today he said, "only diplomacy, not threats to refer it to the [[U.N.]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]], could defuse a standoff."

In a press conference on Friday, [[United Nations]] Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] said that he had spoken to the Iranian representative in the IAEA in Vienna, Ali Laridziani, who said "Iran is interested in serious and constructive negotiations, but without time constraints."

The United States and the E.U. harshly criticized Annan's "spin" on the Iranian response, stating that because diplomatic talks have reached their limit, the matter should be deferred to the Security Council.

Iran continues to insist that its nuclear energy is to be used to provide electricity for an "energy-needy economy, not to build (atom) bombs."

Iran announced on January 10, 2006, that it was going to "resume full nuclear research."

Day 7 of the Hezbollah-Israel conflict
{{date|July 18, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
One week has passed since [[w:Israel|Israel]] responded to a [[w:Hezbollah|Hezbollah]] attack along the Lebanon-Israel border. There is no immediate end of the conflict in sight as Israeli airborne, naval and ground units have pounded a wide array of targets in [[w:Lebanon|Lebanon]]. Hezbollah in turn has launched rocket and missile attacks on northern Israel.  

The Lebanese PM [[w:Fouad Siniora|Fouad Siniora]] condemned Israel saying their attacks have been "opening the gates of hell and madness". He reiterated the Lebanese government position, urging Hezbollah to release Israeli soldiers, and calling on Israel to cease its attacks, terming them "disproportionate". However, an Israeli general said that the offensive could go on for weeks to come. 

Israeli PM Ehud Olmert claimed that last week's kidnappings were a timed attempt to divert attention from [[w:Iran|Iran]]'s nuclear programme. The Rapporteur of Iran's Majlis' National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Kazem Jalali dismissed the allegation, denying any such role. 

The civilian population in Lebanon has taken the largest toll in the conflict; 200 Lebanese civilians have been reported to be killed in the past seven days, 30 of them today. As a result of Hezbollah fire, at least 24 Israelis have been reported killed, including 9 civilians at the Haifa train station.  In addition, 30 Lebanese soldiers have died without engaging Israeli units. Eleven of them were killed today in an Israeli air strike on a Lebanese army base east of Beirut. A Lebanese barracks was also hit yesterday, killing several soldiers.

The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] want an international peace contingent to be stationed in southern Lebanon to stop Hezbollah from firing missiles into Israel. The force would act as a stabilisation force against attacks from both sides in the conflict. 

500,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon by the violence which could end in a humanitarian disaster, UN said.

A UN team was in Israel today, holding talks with the Israeli FM about a possible ceasefire agreement. However, the minister reiterated Israel's ultimatum that its two soldiers should be released and the Lebanese government posts troops in southern Lebanon before agreeing on a ceasefire. Lebanon say they fear posting soldiers in it's southern region could spark a civil war in the country.

Hezbollah militants have also today fired rockets on towns in northern Israel. Haifa, Acre, Kiryat Shemona and the region of Gush Halav have been hit. One Israeli was killed. Hezbollah have made comparisons between the Israeli "enemy combatants" they are holding without trial, and the inmates of [[:w:Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]] who they say have a similar status.

Today, transport trucks were again targeted by warplanes. Israel says it believed that the trucks were transporting missiles for Hezbollah. The Israeli military say 750 Hezbollah rockets, missiles and mortars have so far been fired since the start of the crisis.

Hundreds of foreigners have been evacuated from Lebanon by any available transportation. Ships, helicopters and buses have been used  by several European countries and the United States to ferry their citizens out of the country.

Indonesia warns Australia over West Papuan asylum seekers
{{date|February 3, 2006}} 
[[Image:Flag of West Papua.svg|300px|thumb|right|West Papuan Independence Flag]]
[[Indonesia]]'s ambassador to [[Australia]] has warned that relations between the two neighbors could be "strained" if the Howard Government grants political asylum to a group of refugees from the troubled Indonesian province of {{w|West Papua}}.

The 43 West Papuans, pro-independence activists and their families, arrived on {{w|Cape York}}, Australia on January 18 after a five-day voyage in an outrigger canoe. They were later taken to an immigration detention facility on [[Christmas Island]], a remote Australian territory in the Indian Ocean.

A spokesman for the group says they fear they will be killed if returned to Indonesian-controlled Papua, where a pro-independence movement has been operating since the 1960s.

Jakarta's ambassador warned of strained relations if they are granted asylum. Indonesia's ambassador, Teuku Mohammad Hamzah Thayeb, said the group had nothing to fear from Indonesian authorities. Asked if granting asylum to the group would strain Australia/Indonesia relations, Thayeb said: "I would hope it will not, but it certainly would have an effect. That's why we have to manage this together and find a solution." President {{w|Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono}} has also guaranteed the group's safety should they return.

Queensland National Senator {{w|Barnaby Joyce}}, who met with the 43 refugees on Christmas Island, said they appear to have a genuine asylum claim and had been persecuted because of their Christian beliefs. "There are documented cases of members within their families being shot," he said. "There's certainly on the record experiences of them being jailed and tortured so I think they would be under risk if they went back," he said.

The group, which includes seven children, arrived carrying a banner accusing Indonesia of terrorism and genocide in the province. Indonesian troops have been repeatedly accused of rights abuses in Papua province, which was taken over by Jakarta in 1963. Over 100,000 Papuans, one-sixth of the population, have died in military operations. 
[[Image:LocationIndonesia.png|left|thumb|250px|Major landmasses of Indonesia]]
Immigration Minister {{w|Amanda Vanstone}} said, "if they ask for protection we will consider the claim appropriately and if it is appropriate to offer it, we will offer it." 

The leader of the asylum seekers, Herman Wainggai, says the Indonesian military treat indigenous Papuans "like animals". Mr Thayeb disagreed: "We have changed fundamentally within ourselves," he said. 

Indonesia offered Papua special autonomy in 2001 in an effort to quell unrest from the Melanesian population in the resource-rich area. Mr Wainggai described the Papuan autonomy as a "sham", and said there have been many reports of the Indonesian military "murdering and raping people, and destroying villages since autonomy came into force."

Papua controversially became an Indonesia province after a vote in 1969 overseen by the United Nations called the {{w|Act of Free Choice|"Act of Free Choice"}}. The Act of Free Choice was drafted by the UN and gave every adult the right to vote on the issue of independence. However, only 1022 people hand-picked by the Indonesian authorities were allowed to vote. Reinforcing the dubious nature of the poll, the voters gave 100 per cent approval to become part of Indonesia.

Indonesia's ambassador said there was no reason for the West Papuans to seek asylum as they were not criminals. 

The Australian Greens said the Indonesian ambassador's assurances that West Papuan asylum seekers would be safe if they returned home should not be believed.

"The new Indonesian Ambassador's assurances about the safety of West Papuan refugees if they are returned to Indonesia are not credible," Senator Nettle said. "The escalating repression of the independence movement and generalised suppression of the people of West Papua is well documented." 

"The Australian government should not give in to Indonesian pressure," Senator Nettle said.
 
Senator Joyce said the group of native West Papuans were Christian, which meant they are ethnically, religiously and politically isolated after an influx of Indonesians to the province.

China and Russia counter resolution against North Korea
{{date|July 12, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag of North Korea.svg|thumb|The flag of North Korea]]
[[China]] and [[Russia]] have today put forward a jointly-crafted resolution regarding sanctions against [[North Korea]]. The document was released to counter a [[Japan|Japanese]] alternative, which was written in response to last week's [[w:Taepodong-2|Taepodong-2]] missile tests. This Sino-Russian version, however, removes sections which could advocate military action against [[w:Pyongyang|Pyongyang]]. 

The move comes after a number of Chinese requests this week to revise the original Japanese version, claiming that tensions in the region would increase if it were to be adopted. As a result, Chinese diplomats have been instructed to veto the initial document, which advocates much stronger sanctions against North Korea than neighbours Russia and China would have felt comfortable with. 

The two nations presented their revised resolution to the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] this afternoon. After reviewing a draft copy - which was released to the Associated Press - several influential nations, including the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], have reaffirmed their support for Japan's initial version.

Both Russia and China, who share a border with the nation, have been placed in a difficult position by last week's missile tests. Both countries have relatively positive relations with North Korea but their commitment to the international community - mainly the [[w:UN Security Council|UN Security Council]] - has led to an impartial stance on this issue. The publishing of this "counter-resolution" is the first active move the two nations have made against the North since the tests, who still approve of sanctions but describe Japan's proposed extensive restrictions as "over-reacting."

Japan and the United States have announced tonight that they still intend to put their first resolution to a vote, despite the threat of a veto by China and possibly Russia. A Japanese diplomat has said that the Sino-Russian reworking was "a step in the right direction" but lacked decisive wording on important issues. The use of weaker language - namely asking instead of demanding - has also been criticised.

[[w:South Korea|South Korea]] has not commented directly on the new resolution, but has instead urged North Korea to return to the [[w:Six-Party Talks|Six-Party Talks]], which are seen to be a key step forward in ensuring diplomacy between the nation and its democratic peers.

North Korea test-fires missiles
{{date|July 4, 2006}}
[[Image:LocationNorthKorea.png|thumb|250 px]]
{{wikipediapar|North Korean missile test, 2006}}
The [[w:Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea) has test fired seven ballistic missiles including the long-range [[w:Taepodong-2|Taepodong-2]] on Tuesday. The tests were criticised by officials from several countries, particularly Japan, Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the United States. The [[w:UN Security Council|UN Security Council]] held a closed meeting today to discuss the developments.

A North Korean foreign ministry official, Lee Byong Dok, acknowledged the tests while speaking to reporters in Pyongyang. Japan's NHK television quoted the official as saying, "This is an issue of national sovereignty, and other countries do not have the right to judge. We are not bound by any agreement regarding missiles." North Korean media made no mention of the launches.[http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2006-07-05T054422Z_01_N04284348_RTRUKOC_0_US-KOREA-NORTH-MISSILE.xml&pageNumber=2&imageid=&cap=&sz=13&WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage4]

Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer said Wednesday that "there could be one or two more" launches of short or medium-ranged missiles.[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1680006.htm]

Major South Korean newspaper reported Thursday that Pyongyang got three or four missiles on launch pads. The missiles are thought to be short- or medium-range.[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060706/ap_on_re_as/nkorea_missiles_ready]

The missile launches comes five days after US president George W Bush, after talks with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, warned North Korea on test-launching a long range missile.[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/dprk/2006/dprk-060629-voa01.htm]

The first missile was launched at 3:33 a.m. [[w:Japan Standard Time|JST]] Wednesday (1833 [[w:Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] Tuesday) and fell into the Sea of Japan, between the Korean peninsula and the Japanese mainland.

According to CNN, at least three missiles were launched including a Taepodong-2,  which failed (or was aborted) in less than a minute. The Taepodong-2 is an intercontinental ballistic missile ([[w:Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]) with an estimated range of up to 6,000 km (3,730 miles). This would bring parts of the United States like Alaska and Hawaii within striking range of the missile. The ability to achieve this range has so far not been demonstrated in a test.

A fourth short-range missile was launched at 7:12 a.m. JST (2212 UTC), according to CNN.

Contrary to information given by US officials, Russia says that Pyongyang launched as many as ten missiles yesterday. This was also earlier reported by the South Korean agency Yonhap.

The launch of the seventh missile was reported by [[w:South Korean|South Korean]] and [[w:Japanese|Japanese]] officials on Wednesday. Media reports said the latest launch was at 17:22 [[w:Japan Standard Time|JST]](8:22 [[w:Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). The missile landed six minutes after the launch according to Japan's Kyodo News agency.

Two of the missiles were launched from a site other than the one intelligence officials have watched for weeks ahead of a possible long-range missile test, a senior United States State Department official said. Two senior U.S. State Department officials said on Tuesday that fuel trucks had departed the site where the Taepodong-2 sits on a launching pad, indicating that a test may occur in the near future.

The North Korean removal of the fuel trucks and other auxiliary equipment meant the North Koreans may have finished fueling the missile, said the officials, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the information. Should the North Koreans have completed the fueling "all they would need to do now is press the button," one source said.

==Reactions==
The test launches were criticised by many countries and led to an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council the day after the initial launches. 

The US National Security Advisor [[w:Stephen Hadley|Stephen Hadley]] called the test launches "provocative behaviour" and confirmed that the Taepodong-2 went down just 35 seconds after being launched.

"It's the Fourth of July, and they know we are watching and they like to play with us," said one senior US official, who has followed the North Korean program for years.

Japanese and South Korean military have been placed on high alert following the tests. The Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said that continued talks are needed to defuse the current standoff, adding "We need both pressure and dialogue, ... There will be no solution without dialogue."

[[w:NORAD|NORAD]] was put on heightened alert in the past two weeks and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency told CNN that two missiles for interception of ballistic missiles were activated in California prior to test launches.

The South Korean Senior Security Secretary, Suh Choo-Suk said that the tests have deepened North Korea's isolation and called for a halt to the "provocative activity" and a return to the six-party talks and international efforts for nuclear non-proliferation, adding "North Korea should be held responsible for all the consequences."

In a closed meeting today Japan, Britain and the United States prepared a UN resolution that demanded that all nations withhold technology, goods and funding that potentially could be used for North Korea's missile program. It also called on the North Korea to immediately stop the development, testing and deployment of ballistic missiles. No voting on the resolution is expected today.

Japan announced Wednesday that they would suspend charter flights between the two countries as well has bringing a ferry service to a six-months halt. This means that the only passenger and trade link would be closed for half a year. The country is also considering a call for sanctions through the UN.

The South Korea has said that that it will withhold 500,000 tons of rice and 100,000 tons of fertilizer aid to their northern neighbours.

The United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan have stressed that the test launches will not bring an end to any diplomatic negotiations.

China, the North Korea's closest ally, called the tests "regrettable", but indicated that they would favor a more lenient UN statement. However, they did not defend the launches in the UN meeting on Wednesday.

Stocks and currencies fell in Asia after the test launches, but investors considered it a short-term impact based on experiences from previous North Korean launches. [http://www.financialexpress-bd.com/index3.asp?cnd=7/6/2006&section_id=7&newsid=30067&spcl=no]

Ninety New Zealanders evacuated from Lebanon
{{date|July 21, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
Ninety [[w:New Zealanders|New Zealanders]] have been evacuated from war-torn [[w:Lebanon|Lebanon]] and are on their way to the safety of [[w:Cyprus|Cyprus]]. Three ships are helping in the evacuations, two [[w:British Navy|British Navy]] and one [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] (UN) chartered ferry.

There are 1,500 people on board the two British ships "There are definitely New Zealanders aboard, but there just isn't an actual passenger list. We're hoping there are quite good numbers of New Zealanders onboard," Helen Tunnah, a spokeswoman for the [[w:New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade|New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] (MFAT), said.

Officer Andrew Greig's family, which includes his wife and two sons, are on board the UN ferry.

This evacuation comes after [[w:Britain|Britain]] announced it will conduct a formal evacuation, which also includes New Zealand citizens because New Zealand does not have an embassy in Lebanon. 

[[w:Israel|Israel]] has been attacking Lebanon for three weeks. Hundreds of civilians and two Israeli soldiers have already died due to this conflict as well as two [[Hezbollah]] fighters and about twenty Lebanese soldiers.

[[w:MFAT|MFAT]] will help the New Zealand evacuees find accommodation and help them with getting travel arrangements. "Because of the sheer number of people wishing to leave, it is expected to take days before the evacuation is completed," Helen Tunnah said.

UK and U.S. bombing raids against Iraq increased in 2002
{{date|May 30, 2005}}<br> 

[[Image:B-52.jpg|right|240px|B-52 Stratofortress]]

New information surfaced on Saturday, 28 May, that suggest that the US and UK increased air strikes against Iraq in mid 2002. The Ministry of Defence figures, provided in response to a question from Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, show that allied aircraft doubled the rate at which they were dropping bombs on Iraq beginning in May of 2002.

This apparent escalation in the number and intensity of air strikes was initiated prior to the passage of [[w:UN Security Council Resolution 1441|UN Resolution 1441]] in November 2002 and prior to the [[w:Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq|US Congress authorizing the use of force against Iraq in October 2002]].  Critics claim that this was an attempt to provoke [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]] or soften his military infrastructure in preparation for a more comprehensive military campaign, and that it reaffirms their assertions that the Bush administrations was determined to go to war long before the official decision was made.

In August 2002, allied commander Tommy Franks admitted that this operation was designed to "degrade" Iraqi air defences in the same way as the air attacks that began the 1991 Gulf war, but according to legal guidance appended to the [[Secret Downing Street Memo leaked|Downing Street memo]] (dated 23 July 2002) the allied aircraft were only "entitled to use force in self-defence where such a use of force is a necessary and proportionate response to actual or imminent attack from Iraqi ground systems".

According to military documents shown to the Sunday Express in 2002, the Allies invaded Iraq from Turkey on August 8th, 2002, after an air strike on the 6th that took out a crucial air defence system.

Pentagon officials initially denied there had been any military action or incursion, but when challenged with specific military details a spokesman called back two hours later issuing the terse statement: "We can't comment on current or future operations."

The evidence seems to corroborate information in the Downing Street memo:

:"''CDS said that military planners would brief CENTCOM on 1-2 August, Rumsfeld on 3 August and Bush on 4 August.

:''The two broad US options were:

:''(a) Generated Start. A slow build-up of 250,000 US troops, a short (72 hour) air campaign, then a move up to Baghdad from the south. Lead time of 90 days (30 days preparation plus 60 days deployment to Kuwait).

:''(b) Running Start. '''Use forces already in theatre (3 x 6,000), continuous air campaign,''' initiated by an Iraqi casus belli. Total lead time of 60 days with the air campaign beginning even earlier. A hazardous option.

:''The US saw the UK (and Kuwait) as essential, with basing in Diego Garcia and Cyprus critical for either option. Turkey and other Gulf states were also important, but less vital. The three main options for UK involvement were:

:''(i) Basing in Diego Garcia and Cyprus, plus three SF squadrons.

:''(ii) As above, with maritime and air assets in addition.

:''(iii) As above, plus '''a land contribution of up to 40,000, perhaps with a discrete role in <u>Northern Iraq entering from Turkey</u>, tying down two Iraqi divisions.'''

:'''''The Defence Secretary said that the US had already begun "spikes of activity" to put pressure on the regime.''' No decisions had been taken, but he thought the most likely timing in US minds for military action to begin was January, with the timeline beginning 30 days before the US Congressional elections."

In light of these revelations, Representative John Conyers has sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfield. A draft of the letter is available [http://rawstory.com/exclusives/byrne/conyers_downing_street_letter_rumsfeld_529 here].

In Conyer's draft, he states:
:''"The allegations and factual assertions made in the May 29 London Times are in many respects just as serious as those made in the earlier article. If true, these assertions indicate that not only had our nation secretly and perhaps illegally agreed to go to war by the summer of 2002, but that we had gone on to take specific and tangible military actions before asking Congress or the United Nations for authority."

:''Thus, while there is considerable doubt as to whether the U.S. had authority to invade Iraq, given, among other things, the failure of the U.N. to issue a follow-up resolution to the November 8, 2002 Resolution 1441, it would seem that the act of engaging in military action via stepped up bombing raids that were not in response to an actual or imminent threat before our government asked for military authority would be even more problematic from a legal as well as a moral perspective.

:''As a result of these new disclosures, I would ask that you respond as promptly as possible to the following questions:

:''1) Did the RAF and the United States military increase the rate that they were dropping bombs in Iraq in 2002? If so, what was the extent and timing of the increase?

:''2) What was the justification for any such increase in the rate of bombing in Iraq at this time? Was this justification reviewed by legal authorities in the U.S.?

:''3) To the best of your knowledge, was there any agreement with any representative of the British government to engage in military action in Iraq before authority was sought from the Congress or the U.N.? If so, what was the nature of the agreement?

:''In connection with all of the above questions, please provide me with any memorandum, notes, minutes, documents, phone and other records, e-mails, computer files (including back-up records) or other material of any kind or nature concerning or relating thereto in the possession or accessible by the Department of Defense."

China releases 'Human rights report' on U.S.
{{date|April 2, 2005}}

In response to the [[w:United States|United States]] Department of State issuing its annual ''[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/ Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]'', [[w:People's Republic of China|China]] has issued a contradictory report highlighting [[w:Human rights|human rights]] abuses in the US, ''[http://english.people.com.cn/200503/03/eng20050303_175406.html The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2004]''.

For the past six years, the People's Republic of China has issued an annual statement on human rights in the US in response to the annual report on China.  "Only the Chinese people themselves have the right to comment on the human rights situation in their own country," said Liu Jianchao, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.  

The US State Department, beginning in 1977, issues annual country reviews of its perceptions of the rights records of individual nations, based on the ''[[w:Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]''.  The current report for 2004, released on February 28, 2005, contains candid assessments and detailed criticism of the human rights records of 192 countries, including China. [[w:Amnesty International|Amnesty International]], the international 'watch-dog organization' for human rights, has however criticized this paper as being biased, because it is made by a government which itself is violating human rights on many sectors.

The Chinese response, was released on March 3, 2005.  In this report, the Chinese government attempts to deflect criticism of itself by drawing attention to the various publicly documented shortcomings within US society, including statistics on crime, violent death, imprisonment, poverty, rape, child abuse, and racial and sexual discrimination that are an acknowledged and publicly documented part of life in the US.

Amnesty International's [http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/usa-summary-eng 2004 annual report on US human rights in 2003] agrees with many of these claims.

Amnesty is also worried about: severe violations committed by the United States' army outside the countries' borders; the situation of the prisoners in [[w:Guantanamo Bay|Guantanamo Bay]]; United States' general misbehaviour against international peace; ill-treatment of US immigrants; ill-treatment and excessive use of force by the US law enforcement officials; the US citizens losing civil rights and liberties after the [[w:September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attacks]]; and continued use of death penalty by the state, which is in direct breach with the 3rd article of the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]' ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights'' (the right to life).

Comment by Peter Edidin of ''[[w:The New York Times|The New York Times]]'', characterized the Chinese report as "a frank indictment [that] draws a picture of America that approaches caricature.  But that doesn't mean it won't buttress the negative image of the United States held by its critics around the world."

This ongoing dispute does not capture the entire relationship of US and China on civil rights.  Even as both sides trade accusations, the US on March 18, 2005, declined to table a resolution at the UN criticizing China, citing the ongoing improvements that are being made in that country.  This is the second time in three years that the US has not submitted  such a resolution, which in fact has never passed the UN when it was submitted before.

Malawi food appeal unanswered by world community
{{date|September  9, 2005}}
[[Image:LocationMalawi.png|thumb|right|Location of Malawi]]
The [[United Nations]] have called upon member states to donate [[US$]]88m to fight hunger in [[Malawi]]. So far, not a single country responded.

U.N {{w|Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator|Emergency Relief Coordinator}} {{w|Jan Egeland}} launched an appeal ten days ago and especially called upon nations in the [[Persian Gulf]], who are benefiting from the current high oil prices, to donate. "There are many countries in the Gulf and elsewhere who have received an enormous windfall from these oil prices. We can save a life for a $1 a day", Egeland said.

Malawi is one the poorest countries in the world. The majority of the population live on less than one US dollar a day. Four million people out of a population of ten million face hunger every single day.

The domestic production of {{w|maize}} has plunged to 1.3 million tons, only half of what is needed to feed the population. The prices on the other hand have increased by 50%, making it even harder for the affected people.

{{w|Oxfam}} estimates that in the entire {{w|southern Africa}} region, about 10 million people would face serious food shortages later this year if the developed countries don't act quickly. [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] is also a major problem for southern Africa with the infection rate being as high as 40% of the adult population.

Fight Continues, 100 dead in Somalia
{{date|May 11, 2006}}

[[Mogadishu]], capital of [[Somalia]], is witnessing a heavy fighting over the past four days. Almost 100 people have died and 200 have been wounded in the clashes, as health officials said yesterday. The battle between the {{w|Islamic Court Union}} and the {{w|Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counterterrorism}} has centered on the northern neighborhood of Sii-Sii. Many of the casualties are civilians caught in the crossfire. There was a temporary truce, but that did not last long.

[[Islam]]ic militia leader {{w|Sheikh Sharif Ahmed}} called a unilateral truce on Tuesday in response to appeals from those affected by the violence. But his opponents said the truce was called because of a lack of ammunition. The warlords' alliance spokesman Hussein Gutale Rageh said they would only accept the ceasefire if their rivals withdrew from territory they have occupied during the fighting.

The fighting started late on Sunday, when an alliance of warlords attacked the vehicle of a group allied to the Islamic courts, according to eyewitnesses.

This is the second round of the city's most serious fighting in a decade. In March 2006, clashes between the two sides killed at least 90 people. 

The [[United Nations]] has appealed to both sides to halt the clashes. UN special representative for Somalia, {{w|François Lonseny Fall|Francois Lonseny Fall}}, appealed today for the rival militias to end the hostilities, saying they had created fear and chaos for civilians caught in the crossfire.

"The indiscriminate use of heavy machine guns, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and artillery in and between urban areas is unacceptable," said Francois Fall. 

Somalia has not had an effective national authority for 15 years after the ousting of longtime dictator President {{w|Siad Barre}} in 1991. A UN-backed transitional government has based itself in the central city of {{w|Baidoa}}, but has so far failed to assert itself elsewhere.

Islamic fundamentalists have portrayed themselves as an alternative capable of bringing order and peace, but they have not hesitated to use force and have allegedly linked up with [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists. The Islamic courts have restored order to some parts of the city by providing justice under [[Sharia]] - Islamic law. The courts say the warlords alliance is a pawn of the [[United States]].

Last week, Somalia President {{w|Abdullahi Yusuf}} accused the US of funding the coalition of warlords. The US government says it does support efforts to restore stability to Somalia but refuses to give details on who it backs and how. The alliance of warlords recently created the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism. It has an anti-terror task force based in nearby [[Djibouti]]. It accuses the Islamic courts of sheltering foreign al-Qaeda leaders.

Bird Flu found in Africa
{{date|February  8, 2006}}
{{Avian Flu infobox}}
The H5N1 [[w:Avian Flu|Avian Flu]] virus, also known as Bird Flu, has been found in [[Nigeria]] by Italian scientists. Tests done on samples in a laboratory confirm that the strain is the one that can kill people, although no human cases have been reported said the Paris-based United Nations body. This is the first time is has appeared on the continent.

Reports say tests of the virus closely resemble the virus in [[Asia]]. The virus has been discovered in poultry flocks in a large Nigerian farm. "It is the first report of the disease in Africa," the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health ([[w:OIE|OIE]]) said on Wednesday.

"It's going to be very difficult to mount an eradication campaign," said Dr. Alex Thiermann, president of the OIE's international animal health code, from [[w:Paris, France|Paris, France]]. "With what we have today, it is a highly pathogenic H5N1 - the same, or very closely related to the previous ones," said Thiermann. He also added, "a full genetic analysis of sample viruses is expected to be completed by late Thursday."

Maria Zampaglione of the Paris-based OIE said "An outbreak has been detected. A local poultry farm keeping 46,000 birds was affected, of which 42,000 were infected and 40,000 of those, died." The farm is located in Jaji, which is a village in the northern state of Kaduna.

"The farm is located near the Niger Delta, one of the largest over-wintering areas for wild birds in Africa." said Thiermann.

Quarantine measures on the control and movement of poultry have been taken, and the farm has been disinfected said Nigerian authorities.

"However, it is too early to say how serious the outbreak is and how big its spread could be," said Ilaria Capua of the Italian bird flu centre in Padua. "We have to be cautious in evaluating the possible implications of these findings."

In [[w:Rome, Italy|Rome]], Samuel Jutzi, a director of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization said, "if the situation in Nigeria gets out of control, it will have a devastating impact on the poultry population in the region. It will seriously damage the livelihoods of millions of people and it will increase the exposure of humans to the virus."

"When you have 46,000 chickens in a house, usually you have some degree of biocontainment...So these (chickens) are not likely to be the ones to first encounter migratory waterfowl," Thiermann said.  

Wildlife circles have been debating on whether or not wild birds are spreading the virus around the globe. Experts believe they are playing a role but most believe poultry movement, poultry products and poultry manure is the main cause of the spreading of the virus.

"But probably not in this case," said Thiermann. "While it's too early to blame the wildlife, it's very likely to be in an area that's remote enough that it's not likely to be associated with international trade."

OIE spokeswoman Zampiglione also said, "Experts had been fearing an African outbreak for months. The conditions there are more likely to lead to contagion from birds to man."

Australian Defence Minister resigns
{{date|January 21, 2006}}
[[Image:Robert_Murray_Hill.jpg|right]]
Australian Defence Minister, Liberal [[w:Robert Murray Hill|Senator Robert Hill]], 59, has resigned after almost a quarter of a century in Parliament and confirmed he will retire from the Senate. The Senator has been the longest serving leader of his party in the Upper House since Federation. 

Robert Murray Hill was elected to the Senate for South Australia in 1980. Having spent 13 years in Opposition, he was appointed Environment Minister when the Howard Government was elected in 1996. He will serve out his final few days in the Senate in the next session of parliament. 

Prime Minister Howard said Senator Hill's exit after almost 25 years in Parliament and 13 years as Liberal Senate leader would be a "huge loss" for the Government.

Mr Hill said it was good to make a decision to leave parliament before he was forced out for other reasons.

At his farewell media conference on Friday, he said he has "no regrets." Questioned over the wisdom of Australia's involvement in the Iraq war he said, "...there was a time where we saw defence simply in terms of almost hiding behind the moat. We no longer do that." 

"We go out and we look after Australia's interests and we become part of an international community that's interested in security and stability, and we're prepared to take risks to achieve those goals," he said.

The Australia Defence Association praised his efforts as defence minister, a position he has held since November, 2001. "He's easily the best defence minister of the Howard government and the best, along with (Labor's) Robert Ray since the 1970s," Defence Association spokesman Neil James said.

It's widely expected that Robert Hill will become the next Australian representative to the United Nations in New York. Senator Hill yesterday articulated a case for reform of the global body. "This Government believes in collective security, it believes in the commitments of the charter, but it would like to see the UN work efficiently and effectively," he said. 

The most likely candidates for the defence portfolio are Finance Minister Nick Minchin and Health Minister Tony Abbott.

Consensus reached on incentive package for Iran
{{date|June 2, 2006}}

In {{w|Vienna}}, top diplomats from the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Germany]] reached an agreement on Thursday on an incentive package to offer to [[Iran]] in exchange for its giving up {{w|Nuclear program of Iran|uranium enrichment}}.

The specifics of the incentive package were not revealed, but a delegation from Europe led by European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana is expected to formally deliver the offer to Iran in the coming days.  Iran would then have several weeks to respond.

In a prepared statement, British foreign secretary Margaret Beckett said, "We have agreed on a set of far-reaching proposals as a basis for discussions with Iran. We believe they offer Iran the chance to reach a negotiated agreement based on cooperation."

Beckett did not mention any sanctions to be taken against Iran if it refuses to comply.  The United Nations Security Council is expected to take up the question of sanctions should Iran turn down the offer.

The agreement comes a day after the United States offered to participate in multilateral negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program if Iran suspends its uranium enrichment program. Iran agreed to the idea of holding talks but rejected the preconditions.

In the first direct reaction by the Iranian government to the offer, Iranian foreign minister [[Manouchehr Mottaki]] said on Thursday; "Iran welcomes dialogue under just conditions but won't give up our rights," Iranian state-run television reported.  "We won't negotiate about the Iranian nation's natural nuclear rights but we are prepared, within a defined, just framework and without any discrimination, to hold dialogue about common concerns," he said.

Kofi Annan: Iraq situation much worse than civil war
{{date|December 4, 2006}}
[[Image:Kofi Annan.jpg|left|130px|thumb|[[Kofi Annan]]]]
In an interview with BBC's Lyse Doucet, retiring Secretary General of the United Nations, [[Kofi Annan]], confessed to sadness at being unable to prevent the war against [[Iraq]]. He said that although [[Saddam Hussein]] had been a brutal dictator, at least there had been peace in the streets and people were secure in their everyday lives. Saying the war had caused "killing and bitterness", he said that the situation is now "much worse than a civil war".

Mr Annan’s comments provoked the anger of Iraq's national security adviser, {{w|Mouwaffaq al-Rubaie}}, who said he was shocked by what Kofi Annan had said and, in turn, he accused the [[United Nations]] of failing in its duty to the Iraqi people. 

{{w|Donald Rumsfeld}}, former [[United States|U.S.]] Defence Secretary and one of the architects of the invasion of Iraq by USA and [[United Kingdom|Britain]], admitted in a secret memorandum that the strategy in Iraq is not working properly. Just two weeks before his resignation he advocated a change in policy saying "Clearly, what US forces are currently doing in Iraq is not working well enough or fast enough".

Former U.S. Secretary of State {{w|James Baker}}, who heads up the study group commissioned by the President to advise on the situation in Iraq  referred to Iraq as being "a helluva mess". On Wednesday, {{w|Colin Powell}}, former Secretary of State who was in post at the time of the invasion of Iraq, told a conference in the {{w|United Arab Emirates}} that Iraq was in a state of civil war. This was an opinion expressed in March by former Iraqi prime minister {{w|Ayad Allawi}}.

Kofi Annan appeals for cooperation and leadership from USA
{{date|December 11, 2006}}

UN Secretary General, [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] delivered his farewell address today at the Truman Presidential Museum & Library, [[w:Independence, Missouri|Independence, Missouri]]. He reminded his audience of the far sighted leadership provided by President [[w:Harry S Truman|Harry S Truman]] in championing the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] in its early years. Annan went on to offer five lessons, every one of which led him to conclude that "such leadership is no less sorely needed now than it was sixty years ago". 

The lessons he had learned while in office were that the security of everyone is linked to that of everyone else and that we are all responsible for each other’s welfare; that security and development ultimately depend on respect for human rights and the rule of law; that governments must be accountable for their actions in the international arena, as well as in the domestic one; and that, only by working together through the United Nations, can security, welfare and development be achieved.

In the course of his speech, Kofi Annan referred to [[w:America|America]] as being in the vanguard of the global [[w:human rights|human rights]] movement but he warned "that lead can only be maintained if America remains true to its principles, including in the struggle against [[w:terrorism|terrorism]]". 

He concluded his address saying "More than ever today Americans, like the rest of humanity, need a functioning global system through which the world’s peoples can face global challenges together. And in order to function, the system still cries out for far-sighted American leadership, in the Truman tradition. I hope and pray that the American leaders of today, and tomorrow, will provide it." 

Afterwards, he was asked why he had chosen in his farewell speech to make such a pointed attack on America. He replied, sharply, that "An appeal for cooperation and leadership should never be seen as an attack".

Iran parliament to review compliance with IAEA standards
{{date|December 27, 2006}}

[[Image:Flag of Iran.svg|170px|right]]
Following a bill, which was passed with approximately 81% by the 207 MPs attending, [[Iran]]'s {{w|Parliament of Iran|parliament}} wants Iran to review its compliance with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]. This was the first time since the {{w|Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution}} that a bill was passed in five minutes. This bill was given double-urgency status, making it a higher priority over everything else. This passage occurs after the UN implemented sanctions against Iran for continuing its nuclear program; the new law permits for Iran to continue its program against the UN's wishes.

This new law allows President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] to take action about {{w|Nuclear program in Iran|the use of nuclear energy in Iran}}, including establishing conditions of inspections by the [[UN]]. However, the bill does not authorize the complete end of inspections.

The UN's atomic agency's governors may meet in January to consider imposing more sanctions if Iran does not end its nuclear program 60 days after the sanctions imposed on Saturday by the [[UN Security Council]].

Iran is considering withdrawing from the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty}}.

New UN Secretary General assumes post
{{date|January 1, 2007}}
{{Wikinews Today short infobox}}
[[Image:Bankimoon.jpg|thumb|left|New UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon]]
[[Ban Ki-moon]], [[South Korea]]n foreign minister, officially assumed his post as [[United Nations]] [[w:United Nations Secretary General|Secretary-General]] today.

Ban, the eighth [[w:United Nations|UN]] Secretary-General, is also the first Asian to serve in this office in 35 years.

Ban, 62, grew up on the Korean peninsula in the midst of the [[w:Korean War|Korean War]] that divided the region. He promises to bring peace to the [[w:2006 North Korean nuclear test|North Korean nuclear conflict]]. 

Along with North Korea, Ban faces a litany of difficult issues including the genocide in Darfur, tensions in the Middle East, an international campaign against AIDS and poverty in line with his predecessor Kofi Annan's Millennium Goals, a push to increase the size of the Security Council, and calls for ethics reform within the United Nations.

In his inaugural address, Ban said, "My first priority will be to restore trust."

"The United States will rely on his leadership to help steer the UN organization through the reforms already underway," said White House spokesman Scott Stanzel on Sunday, "and to propel it even further on the path of reform."

Ban will temporarily reside in a hotel in New York City until renovations on his official residence are completed as part of a modernization plan approved by the UN General Assembly.

Sudan may allow joint UN/AU forces in Darfur
{{date|January 9, 2007}}

Mustafa Osman Ismail, [[Sudan|Sudan's]] Presidential Advisor, opened the possibility of allowing some [[w:United Nations#Peacekeeping|United Nations peacekeepers]] into its troubled [[w:Darfur|Darfur]] region. Ismail admitted that the [[w:African Union|African Union]] Commander in Darfur could request non-African troops if he decides that current troop numbers are not sufficient. This would allow forces from organisations such as the UN to send troops there at the Commander's request. When asked whether this would lead to UN troops in Darfur, Ismail replied "You are right."

While the region is [[w:African Union Mission in Sudan|currently overseen by 7,000 AU troops]], hopes indicate that a joint venture might see as many as 17,000 UN and AU troops deployed, in addition to 3,000 police officers.

Sudan had previously rejected UN Security Council Resolution 1706, which authorised 22,500 UN peacekeepers to handle the [[w:Darfur conflict|Darfur conflict]]. Since the start of the conflict, 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million driven from their homes.

Iran's official radio silent about U.N. resolution against Holocaust denials
{{date|January 27, 2007}}

[[Iran]]'s official radio, Voice of Islamic Republic of Iran ([[w:IRIB World Service|IRIB World Service]]), failed to include on its English-language web site any reports about the adoption Friday of the U.N. resolution condemning Holocaust denials. The [[United States|U.S.]]-drafted resolution was adopted without a vote with 103 of the world body's 192 member states signed on as co-sponsors. [[w:Voice of America|Voice of America]] (VOA) reported Iran was the only country indicating opposition to the measure. An Iranian diplomat at the U.N. described the intent of the resolution's sponsors as "mischievous." 

Iran's radio did report extensively on an international cartoon competition in Tehran designed to show drawings with anti-Israel, Holocaust-denial, and pro-Palestinian themes.

While silent about the U.N. resolution, the Iranian radio provided extensive coverage of an earlier international conference in Tehran which questioned the Holocaust. The conference was organized at the initiative of Iran's President [[w:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].  Iranian officials argue that meetings such as last month's Tehran conference serve a scholarly purpose, and accused Israel of manipulating the Holocaust for political purposes. 

[[w:FreeMediaOnline.org|FreeMediaOnline.org]] commented that the failure of Iran's official radio to report promptly on the U.N. resolution against Holocaust denials is typical of media organizations controlled by regimes which suppress freedom of expression and journalistic independence. FreeMediaOnline.org pointed out that journalists in countries like Iran are unable to report on many issues without specific directives from political or religious leaders.

The UN resolution "urges all member States unreservedly to reject any denial of the Holocaust as a historical event," according to the UN Radio website. The resolution designates January 27 as an International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust.

The new UN Secretary-General [[w:Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]] issued the following statement through a spokesperson, "The Secretary-General welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly today [Friday] of a resolution unequivocally condemning any denial of the Holocaust.  This reflects the prevailing view of the international community.  The Secretary-General reiterates his conviction that the denial of historical facts such as the Holocaust is unacceptable.  He expresses his strong desire to see this fundamental principle respected both in rhetoric and in practice."

India sends first all-woman peace keeping force to Liberia
{{date|February 11, 2007}}

[[Image:Indian UN peacekeepers in Liberia January 2007.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Arrival at Monrovia airport {{image|[http://www.un.org/av/photo/detail/0138287.asp UN Photo/Eric Kanalstein]}}]]
An [[India]]n all-female United Nations peacekeeping unit has arrived in [[Liberia]], the first such team to be sent on a foreign mission.

More than a hundred female officers and about 20 men engaged in logistics work flew into Liberia on January 30, where they will receive additional training before starting their mission to strengthen the rule of law and maintain peace in the country. U.N. officials hope an all-female unit can inspire and help Liberian women. 

Last year, Liberia elected [[w:Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf|Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf]] as the first female head of state in Africa after two civil wars in the 1990s devastated the country, displacing hundreds of thousands of people. The country now has to rebuild its basic infrastructure and economy as well as come to terms with the violence of the civil wars. 
{{QuoteLeft|We hope that the presence of this all-female contingent will serve as an incentive and an attraction to encourage young Liberian women to join the Liberian National Police|4=UNMIL Police Commissioner Mohammed Alhassan}}
Commanding officer of the unit, Seema Dhundia told reporters that the attention her unit has received makes her "a bit apprehensive because now we have to exert more to prove our worth, to prove ourselves,"

Eighty-two female U.N. police officers currently serve in Liberia, as part of the [[w:United Nations Mission in Liberia|United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL). 

The UNMIL Police Commissioner Mohammed Alhassan hoped that the all-female contingent will serve "as an incentive and an attraction to encourage young Liberian women to join the Liberian National Police". 

The team has served before in troubled areas in central India and [[w:Kashmir|Kashmir]]. Dhundia herself has been a peace-keeper for 19 years and says her team are well trained and experienced and will be able to handle the situation. 

A U.N. spokesman viewed the role of the all-female unit to not be particularly different from that of the Jordanian, Nepalese and Nigerian units that have been working in the country. The armed unit is to specialize in controlling difficult crowd situations. 

"We hope that the presence of this all-female contingent will serve as an incentive and an attraction to encourage young Liberian women to join the Liberian National Police," said UNMIL Police Commissioner Mohammed Alhassan. The U.N. has set up a special education programme to help women join the police force.

Hopes have been high that the presence of the all-female contingent will encourage victims of rape - which is rampant in the country - to report the crime and that it will make more women interested in becoming police officers and peacekeepers.

U.N. peace-keepers have also been accused of sexual exploitation in the past, and Joanna Foster, the gender adviser to the UN Mission told BBC News that missions employing more women had reported fewer such problems.

UN troops target violent gangs in Haitian slum raid
{{date|February 13, 2007}}

Over 700 troops stormed a [[Haiti]]an slum near the capital city of [[w:Port-au-Prince|Port-au-Prince]] on Friday to oust a gang led by a man known only as Evans, blamed for many murders, kidnappings and rapes in the area. Heavy sustained gunfire was exchanged for several hours in the operation, which  killed four gang members and wounded two U.N. peace keepers, U.N. officials said.

U.N. commander Maj. Gen. Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz said no one was arrested in the raid and no weapons were recovered, but U.N. spokesman told BBC News that the operation had taken away the Evans' gang's base in Cite Soleil.

The raid has been approved by Haitian President [[w:René Préval|René Préval]].

Over 8,000 UN force have been stationed in Haiti since 2004, to restore order following a coup against then President [[w:Jean-Bertrand Aristide|Jean-Bertrand Aristide]].   

The area of Cité-Soleil is home to around 300,000 people and a neighborhood known as Boston was said to be in the control of Evan's gang.

The UN troops raided a school controlled by Evans' gang and their headquarters, called Jamaica Base. This was the largest of the several raids into gang's territory.

UN Security Council approves African Union peace keepers for Somalia
{{date|February 23, 2007}}
{{Article-audiobrief|filename=240207 2100 newsbrief.ogg|commonsurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/240207_2100_newsbrief.ogg|align=right}}
[[Image:LocationSomalia.png|right|thumb|200px|Location of Somalia.]]
[[Image:Somalia-CIA WFB Map.png|right|thumb|200px|Map of Somalia.]]

The [[United Nations|U.N.]] {{w|United Nations Security Council|Security Council}} has approved the deployment of an [[African Union]]-led peace keeping force in [[Somalia]] for a period of six months.

The 15 member council met last Tuesday (February 20), and unanimously authorized Resolution 1744, allowing African Union member states to establish a mission in Somalia "...to support dialogue and reconciliation in Somalia by assisting with the free movement, safe passage and protection" of those involved in the national reconciliation congress, including the federal transition government led by {{w|Ali Mohammed Ghedi}}. 

Other goals will be to create the "necessary security conditions for the provision of humanitarian assistance", and to secure key infrastructure. The mission has been designated as {{w|African Union Mission to Somalia|AMISOM}}, an acronym that stands for ''A''frican ''Mi''ssion in ''Som''alia.

The initiative for the national reconciliation congress was announced by Somalian President {{w|Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed}} during a recent summit of the African Union. In the resolution text, the Council reminds that the congress needs a broad base, with representation of the diversity of the Somalian people.

While exact numbers remain unknown, diplomatic sources spoke of some 8,000 troops that could be sent to the region, half of which would be provided by [[Burundi]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Uganda]]. Ugunda would be the first to start with a phased operation to deploy their troops, some 1,500.

[[Ethiopia]] will not take part in AMISOM. The country's intervention in Somalia in December 2006, working together with forces loyal to Gedi, received much criticism. 

Ethiopian prime minister {{w|Meles Zenawi}}, who recently announced the retreat of the army from Somalia, admitted that he didn't wish for his country to be present any longer, and that the war only served to protect Ethiopia from the {{w|Islamic Courts Union}}, which controlled until last December the largest part of the country, including the capital {{w|Mogadishu}}.

For the purpose of the mission, the Council has lifted the arms embargo in effect since 1992, which it says has helped greatly for peace and security in Somalia. States supplying weapons and supplies still need to inform the sanctions committee, adding that the Council intends to "consider urgently" ways to strengthen the embargo's effectiveness.

Accompanying the resolution, the Security Council has asked Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] "to send a Technical Assessment Mission to the African Union headquarters and Somalia as soon as possible to report on the political and security situation and the possibility of a UN Peacekeeping Operation following the AU’s deployment."

An "aggressive"  strain of [[w:Avian Flu|Avian Flu]] has been detected in two tufted ducks in [[w:Oskarshamn|Oskarshamn]], Southeast [[w:Sweden|Sweden]].

This makes Sweden the ninth country in the [[w:EU|EU]] to confirm Avian Flu on their soil.

Some 35&ndash;40 wild birds were found dead. The birds were brought to [[w:Uppsala|Uppsala]], where an analysis confirmed the presence of an "aggressive" form of Avian Flu. Tests at a laboratory in the [[w:UK|UK]] will later eventually confirm whether the birds died of the lethal [[w:H5N1|H5N1]].

Sweden's Minister of Agriculture, [[w:Ann-Christin Nykvist|Ann-Christin Nykvist]], said at a press conference the discovery was "serious but not unexpected." Sweden has been on high alert since the virus was found on the German island [[w:Rügen|Rügen]] in the [[w:Baltic Sea|Baltic Sea]].

Two security zones are being established around the location where the birds were found. Dead birds will be destroyed and domestic stocks in the affected area will be monitored.

Russia: Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant to be delayed
{{Iran nuclear program}}
{{date|March 13, 2007}}

According to [[w:Russian Federal Atomic Energy Agency|Russia's Federal Atomic Energy Agency]] (RosAtom) further progress on [[w:Nuclear programme of Iran#Bushehr|Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant]], which [[Russia]] has been working to complete, will be delayed because [[Iran]] fell behind in the payment schedule. 

{{QuoteLeft|The fact is that there is no money, and it is impossible to construct without money . . . therefore, our Iranian partners should not be surprised by an extension of the deadline for the launch of the first unit at Bushehr|4=Sergei Novikov, ''RosAtom''}}

The decision threatens to put Iran’s atomic project in jeopardy, just as it faces the threat of more [[United Nations|UN]] sanctions over its controversial nuclear program.

"The fact is that there is no money, and it is impossible to construct without money," RosAtom spokesman Sergei Novikov told [[w:Interfax (press agency)|''Interfax News Agency'']]. Iran suspended payments on January 17 and "therefore, our Iranian partners should not be surprised by an extension of the deadline for the launch of the first unit at Bushehr," he said. 

Under an agreement reached last September, Russia was to deliver nuclear fuel to Bushehr in March and the power station would open in September and begin generating power in November.

When the payment delay was first reported in February [[w:Mohammad Saeedi|Mohammad Saeedi]], the deputy head of the [[w:Atomic Energy Organization of Iran|Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]], denied that Tehran had been late in making payments. "Iran has had no delay whatsoever in making payments for the Bushehr nuclear power plant," Mr. Saeedi was quoted as saying by [[w:Islamic Republic News Agency|''Islamic Republic News Agency'']]. Mr. Novikov said the Iranians blamed the delay on the need to switch payments from [[w:United States currency|dollars]] to [[w:Euro|euros]].

The announcement from RosAtom came after talks between Russian and Iranian officials last week in Moscow failed to reach agreement on the dispute over funding.

UN report says Sudan government guilty of orchestrating Darfur crimes
{{date|March 12, 2007}}
[[Image:Darfur IDPs 1 camp.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Internally displaced persons use sticks and scraps of plastic to construct makeshift shelters at Intifada transit camp near [[w:Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]] in South Darfur.]]

A report from a [[w:United Nations Human Rights Council|United Nations Human Rights Council]] mission "concludes that the government of the [[Sudan]] has manifestly failed to protect the population of [[w:Darfur|Darfur]] from large-scale international crimes, and has itself orchestrated and participated in these crimes." The mission urges the U.N. to take "urgent further action", for example by deploying the proposed U.N. and [[w:African Union|African Union]] peacekeeping forces, and co-operating with the [[w:International Criminal Court|International Criminal Court]].

The report team, lead by [[w:Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[w:Jody Williams|Jody Williams]], further urges Sudan to stop targeting civilians. The report also says the government is allowing militias such as the [[w:Janjaweed|Janjaweed]] to act with impunity, and that government forces are even operating jointly with the militia. The militias themselves and the armed rebel groups aren't spared either; they are accused of serious violations of human rights and international law.

During their month of work, the researchers didn't actually get into Sudan because they were not given visas, but they interviewed hundreds of relevant people (such as refugees), and reviewed thousands of pages from documents on the humanitarian situation in Darfur.

[[Image:Darfur map.png|left|200px|thumb|Fighting between rebel groups and government-backed militia in the Darfur region has killed an estimated 200,000 and displaced 2.5 million.]]
To summarise the situation, the 35-page documents says: "Today, millions are displaced, at least 200,000 are dead, and conflict and abuse are spilling over the border into [[Chad]]." The report says that humanitarian and human rights workers are increasingly being targeted, especially during the past six months. "Killing of civilians remains widespread, ... Rape and sexual violence are widespread and systematic. Torture continues." The experts think the conflict could destabilise the region.

The mission advises the U.N. General Assembly to "request the compilation of a list of foreign companies that have an adverse impact on the situation of human rights in Darfur." The U.N. agencies should then cease to do business with these companies.

Sudanese officials declined to respond to the report immediately, saying that the response will be made in Sudan's address to the United Nations Human Rights Council on Tuesday. Just days ago, Sudanese President [[w:Omar al-Bashir|Omar Hassan al-Bashir]] rejected an interim U.N. plan to bolster African Union peacekeeping forces in Darfur. Up to 24,000 troops were to replace the current 7,000 African Union peacekeepers in the western Sudan region.

The almost 4-year-old Darfur conflict is being fought between the [[w:Janjaweed|Janjaweed]] militia (Arabic for "devils on horseback"; they are camel-herding Arabs) and a group of mostly land-tilling tribes. The Sudanese government in the past denied allegations against them, blaming the rebels who didn't sign the peace treaty of 2006. The International Criminal Court in [[w:The Hague|The Hague]] has already summoned a junior minister of the Sudan, and a militia leader, to answer war crime charges. The government in [[w:Khartoum|Khartoum]] refused to extradite anyone, saying the people responsible would be tried in the Sudan itself.

Ban Ki-moon leads contest for next UN Secretary-General: Poll
{{date|October 3, 2006}}
[[Image:Bankimoon.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Ban Ki-moon]] 
[[South Korea]]n foreign minister [[Ban Ki-moon]] emerged as the likely successor to {{w|United Nations Secretary-General}} [[Kofi Annan]] yesterday when an unofficial poll of [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] members resulted in Ban being the only candidate to avoid a possible {{wikt|veto}} by one of the five permanent members of the council. 

A formal ballot to choose the next Secretary-General has been scheduled for October 9. The Security Council's recommendation will then go to the [[UN General Assembly]] for ratification which is usually a formality. Annan's term ends on December 31, 2006.

The 15 members of the council voted "encourage", "discourage" or "no opinion" beside each candidate's name on Monday's straw vote. The ballot was secret, however the five permanent members of the council who have veto rights, the United Kingdom, United States, France, China and Russia, voted on a blue ballot paper in order to demonstrate which candidates, if any, could escape a veto in the formal vote. 

Ban received 14 "encourage" votes, 1 "no opinion" and no "discourage" or veto votes. Every other candidate received a veto from one of the five permanent members. Ban, 62, has won all four Security Council straw votes which have been held over the past several months but Monday's vote was the first straw poll which distinguished votes by veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council from votes cast by the other ten members.

Following the release of the vote results, [[India]]'s {{w|Shashi Tharoor}} announced his withdrawal as a candidate saying of Ban "It is clear that he will be our next secretary general."

"It is a great honour and a huge responsibility to be secretary-general, and I wish Mr Ban every success in that task," said Tharoor.

Tharoor had placed second in the race receiving 10 "encourage" votes and three "discourages", one of which was from a country with a veto. 

"It is quite clear that from today's straw poll that Minister Ban Ki-moon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly," said Chinese ambassador Wang Guangya.

[[Thailand]]'s Deputy Prime Minister {{w|Surakiart Sathirathai}} and former [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] Finance Minister [[Ashraf Ghani]] each received four votes in favour. Ghani had three vetoes against him and Surakiart two.

The fifth candidate, Prince {{w|Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein|Zeid al-Hussein}} of [[Jordan]] had only two votes in favour and eight against, with one veto.

Monday's vote was not binding.

UN Security Council calls for release of British soldiers in Iran
{{date|March 30, 2007}}
{{2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel}}
The [[United Nations Security Council]] has issued a statement calling for a "early resolution" to the rising tensions between [[United Kingdom]] and [[Iran]] by releasing all 15 British sailors and marines who were detained by Iranian forces on March 23.

"Members of the Security Council expressed grave concern at the capture by the Revolutionary Guard and the continuing detention by the government of Iran of 15 United Kingdom naval personnel and appealed to the government of Iran to allow consular access in terms of the relevant international laws," said the U.N. Security Council in a statement.

"Members of the Security Council support calls, including by the secretary general in his March 29 meeting with the Iranian foreign minister, for an early resolution of this problem including the release of the 15 UK personnel," added the statement.
[[Image:UN security council 2005.jpg|left|200px|thumb|United Nations Security Council.]]
All 15 members of the Council agreed to the wording of the statement and released it after nearly four hours of debate, but [[Russia]] and [[South Africa]] opposed to having the statement or the Council's recommendations be "too harsh" or to put the blame fully on the Iranian government.

Iran released a statement shortly after the Security Council met saying that getting the U.N. involved, "will not be helpful."

"This case can and should be settled through bilateral channels. The British government's attempt to engage third parties, including the Security Council, with this case is not helpful," said a statement released by Iran's U.N Mission.

The sailors and marines from the frigate {{w|HMS Cornwall (F99)|HMS ''Cornwall''}} had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1723, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared after inspection when Iranian gunboats surrounded the sailors and arrested them at gunpoint.

On Thursday, Iran stated that they are "suspending" the release of the 15 soldiers, including {{w|Faye Turney}} a female soldier, 26, who was supposed to be released "very soon."

Iran airs new video of UK crewmen, releases new letters from Turney
{{2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel}}
{{date|March 30, 2007}}

Iranian television has aired new video footage of three of the fifteen [[United Kingdom|UK]] sailors and marines seized by Iran a week ago. On Thursday evening, the Iranian Embassy in London released a second letter purported to be written by detained servicewoman [[w:Faye Turney|Faye Turney]].  

The footage was released hours after Iran criticized yesterday's [[w:United Nations Security Council|United Nations Security Council]] statement, which voiced “grave concern” over the incident and called for an "early resolution" of the matter. 

{{QuoteLeft|It is wrong. It is wrong in terms of the usual conventions that cover this. It is wrong in terms of basic humanity|4=Spokesman for Prime Minister [[w:Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]}} In the video footage, three crewmen are shown with one identified as Nathan Thomas Summers. Summers was seen confessing to being in Iranian waters and apologizing to the Iranian people. "We trespassed without permission," said Summers. "Since we have been arrested our treatment has been friendly. We have not been harmed at all."

"I would like to apologize for entering your waters without any permission ... I deeply apologize," continued Summers. "They have looked after us really well."

According to the BBC, the UK Foreign Office described the latest video as "disgraceful exploitation".

A hand-written note, the second letter apparently written by Faye Turney, was released by Iran on Thursday evening. The letter requests the UK government to withdraw its troops from Iraq. "Isn't it time for us to start withdrawing our forces from Iraq and let them determine their own future," the letter states.

In reply, a Prime Minister's office spokesman said: "It is wrong. It is wrong in terms of the usual conventions that cover this. It is wrong in terms of basic humanity".

Iran has also released a third letter purporting to be from Leading Seaman Turney, addressed to the "British People". The letter states that she has been "sacrificed due to the intervening policies of the Bush and Blair governments" and repeats the call for the withdrawal of British and US forces from Iraq. British [[w:Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[w:Tony Blair|Tony Blair]] said in response: "I really don't know why the Iranian regime keep doing this. All it does is enhance people's sense of disgust at captured personnel being paraded and manipulated in this way."

The [[w:BBC|BBC]] says it has been able to confirm the names of six of the 15 sailors and marines held by Iran. Apart from Leading Seaman Turney and Seaman Summers (from [[w:Shropshire|Shropshire]] and [[w:Cornwall|Cornwall]] respectively), they are: Paul Barton from [[w:Southport|Southport]], Danny Masterton from [[w:Ayrshire|Ayrshire]], Joe Tindall from south [[w:London|London]] and Adam Sperry from [[w:Leicester|Leicester]].

On March 23, the fifteen sailors and marines from the frigate [[w:HMS Cornwall (F99)|HMS ''Cornwall'']] had been inspecting a ship, in what the UK identified as Iraqi waters, when they were surrounded by Iranian gunboats and taken into Iranian custody. Iran claims the UK forces were in Iranian waters, and are still detaining the fifteen.

Taliban resurgent in Pakistan on enforcement of Sharia law
<noinclude>
{{date|May 4, 2007}}
[[Image:Map showing NWFP and FATA.png|right|220px]]

"Pakistan was un-affected by [[Taliban]]s and [[al-Qaeda]] (in my opinion) until the [[US]] flushed them out of [[Afghanistan]]. So [[w:September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] and [[w:International Security Assistance Force|WTC]] and the post WTC attacks by the ISAF (read American, for the locals) forces have led to the present condition in NWFP. At least that is the way the people there see it," wrote <span class="plainlinks">[http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews:Request_an_interview#Riaz_A_Hakeem Riaz A Hakeem]</span class="plainlinks"> in one of a series of email exchanges with ''Wikinews''.

Mr. Hakeem, 58, left the [[w:North-West Frontier Province|North-West Frontier Province]] (NWFP) at the age of 25 and became a naturalized citizen of the [[United States|U.S.]] Now a businessman who is active in [[Texas]] politics, he shares some views as a person who is in touch with his family and friends who remain in the region. He travelled throughout portions of Pakistan at the end of last year.

'''What is the current situation in the NWFP?'''

The [[w:Pashtun people|Pashtun people]] are or were renowned for their hospitality. Many westerners commented on it. Some with suspicion NOT willing to believe some people so poor could be so generous. It was almost a character flaw. One could travel without fear of personal danger as long as you followed local protocols.

That was the sort of mind set among the people. An ageless paradigm of self satisfaction: this is enshrined in the code of the Pashtuns way of life. 

The Islamic radicalism is in reality nothing but the Taliban movement. Not all Pashtuns are Taliban (obviously), but most Taliban are Pashtun. Of these, most belong to the [[w:Federally Administered Tribal Areas|FATA]]. Of these, most were affected by their cousins from Afghanistan coming over. Mingled with them were Arab-Afghans, Uzbeks and some Tajiks and even Chechens. Some of these married within the tribes and formed a bond with the locals. Marriage bonds go back in history. 

This Talibanization shows itself in the content of the Friday sermons at the mosque. Now it shows in the popularity of growing beards, especially since the [[w:Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal|MMA]] - the coalition of religious political party's - won power. More recently in their showdown with the Pakistan army in North and South Waziristan - where according to my sources, people prefer going to the Taliban for justice rather than the older system of Maliks and Political Agents. The latter are known as corrupt. In Pakistan, in general, people are sick of the amount of corruption. 

[[w:Bannu|Bannu]], from where hails the Chief Minister of the NWFP, Mr. Durrani, is now in Taliban control in the sense that there is a parallel government that they have established which is functioning quite well and is popular among the people.

'''Has Taliban influence caused a stricter intrepretation of [[w:Sharia|Sharia law]] in the NWFP?'''

Yes. The Maliks, or tribal elders, consider themselves quite conservatively religious. Even so, they had a laid back attitude towards enforcement of religious doctrine. 

The Taliban emulated the Saudi system of having a department concerned with citizens’ morals (even the name is the same: the department for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice) and this department has, as in Saudi Arabia, an enforcement police, called ''mutawwa'in'', a morals law-enforcement agency. 

'''Is there a shift from tribal elders to clerics, as the main interpreters of law?'''

There has been a movement in that direction, but it has started a power struggle between the clerics who traditionally have been at the lowest strata of the social structure. Now when they have seen a bigger role for themselves, first from the Taliban in Afghanistan – but also the government of the MMA in the NWFP, who are nothing more than glorified clerics themselves, only a little smarter in exploiting religion politically. 

The MMA is largely non-Pashtun, which is a source of discontent in that they stand in the way of Pashtun nationalism, such as it is, because it only rears its head when non-Pashtuns start to usurp power over what the Pashtun consider their turf.

'''The deal made between Pakistan's central government and the North and South Waziristan provinces, where tribal leadership was given the pivotal role in dealing with militants, has been criticized as a failure. What caused this initiative to fail?''' 

First off, I don't agree with the premise of the question, that the "deal" is a "failure" - for the following reasons: 

#In the first place the Pakistan army (govt - same difference) did not have many options. This was the least worst option they had.
#And most importantly, I have said this before, this area is literally in a time warp - which means they proceed at (what seems to us in the west) a glacial pace. I will give an example from the folklore:<blockquote>''The story goes that a Pashtun had to repay (badal) an enemy for a crime against his family and he waited patiently for 20 years (some say 50 years), after this time, he exacted his revenge - but soon after was depressed because he wondered "Did I act too hastily?"''</Blockquote>So one part of Pashtunwali is to "pay back" - (Badal: literally to exchange) which most people translate as revenge. Yes that is the form that is most visible, but badal is also played out in the exchange of gifts at wedding and other celebrations, and in the exchange of favors like in politics. The rules can be arcane, unwritten and hard to follow -- who did what to whom, when, and so on, and what is the proper recompense -- this same give and take would occur in a peace process pursued by the Tribal Maliks, who rule by consensus. There is no actual leader in the western sense, because all the Maliks, in fact all the others are de facto, so many co-equals is a mind set, a paradigm foreign to the uninitiated, as the concept of consensual gay sex is to the Wazir in Waziristan. 
#The agreement has not failed, because it has not been given enough time, in Wazir time reference, not American time presidential election cycle controlled. I do not have a crystal ball, but if I did, I would see NATO troops in Afghanistan long after Iraq is over. Afghanistan can be a success ONLY if we accept one thing, the time warp these people live in -- by my reckoning its still 1700 CE over there. 

'''Is the Talibanization of Pakistan partly due to a perception of corruption among the system of Maliks and Political Agents?''' 

The corruption is in the [[w:Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]], the Pak army and the Pak system of Political Agents (PA) assigned to these tribal zones ([[w:Federally Administered Tribal Areas|FATA]] & PATA). 

These PA have budgets that are much like the [[w:Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in that they are a single line item in the national budget, there is no accountability of where or how the PA spends the money. If one followed the IRS rules and looked at the lifestyles of the PA and compared them with their income, you would soon understand what was going on. 

Musharraf critics are a larger issue. Republicans have coddled Pakistan with the belief that "as long as they are pro America" then democracy in Pakistan will come in due course. Democrats have, I think, insisted Democracy first, and then we can discuss the other issues later.

The Talibanization of Pakistan has more to do with graduates of "[[w:Raiwind|Raiwind]]", a place near Lahore, where the "Tablighi Jamaat" conducts brainwashing camps. It was graduates of this place, in my opinion, that are responsible for Britain's [[w:7 July 2005 London bombings|7/7 attacks]] as an example.

Corruption amongst the Maliks is self limiting because of the egalitarian society they live in and because of [[w:Corruption amongst the Maliks is self limiting because of the egalitarian society they live & because of Pashtunwali|Pashtunwali]].  

'''What is your view on Musharraf suspending judge [[Protests in Pakistan as Chief Justice appears before judges' panel|Iftikhar Chaudhry]]?''' 

I believe, and this is widely held belief, that Musharraf has no constituency of his own for his power base. He wanted legitimization from the Supreme Court, and Mr Choudhry as Chief Justice (their system is not like ours) would not give it. 

So Musharraf has had to hang on to his Army Chief of Staff position to get his power from the Army. If some one else were Chief of Staff, that person could refuse to support Musharraf.

The Justice favorable to the general is Justice Iqbal, who was not the next in line for Chief Justice. The next in line is a Hindu. That presented problems of its own for Musharraf. So when the Hindu judge went for a trip to India, Iqbal became the "available" senior most Supreme Court judge, and hence the haste and lack of decorum with which Justice Chaudhry was removed.

'''What is the prevailing sentiment regarding Pakistani government efforts in the provinces and the international effort in Afghanistan to combat Taliban and affiliated militants?''' 

In my dealings and inquires, '''one''' thing stood out like a sore thumb - the conspiracy theories vis-à-vis anything having to do with America. I mentioned to one of my close friends that events that were previously ascribed as acts of God were now considered acts of the [[w:Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Some even believed that the Earthquake in the northern areas was because of some sort of underground secret "bomb" used by the CIA. Lack of evidence is further proof that the CIA did it. I was flabbergasted, and started to give this kind of thinking as an example in speaking to "educated" Pakistani's - and among these, those that did agree that the earthquake was NOT the work of the CIA, they would start giving other examples, notably the Blow up of the plane carrying Zia ul Haq an ex President of Pakistan, in which the US Ambassador also perished. When I would point this out, the response would be that that is the sort of thing they do to take away suspicion from themselves.

In a nutshell, the impression I came away with is, there is NO war of civilizations going on. What is going on is a war between literacy and illiteracy.

Taliban are not visible in the areas I visited, but the militants handiwork clearly is - as elsewhere, the common criminals are taking advantage of this situation, and crime is up significantly. One new crime is Cell phone "snatching" - it's easy and nobody wants to pursue it. If some one is using a Razr phone, he can expect to be hit soon if he uses it in public. So people have two cell phones, one fancy to show off, and one for use in public places. 

Insofar as "foreign" militants are captured and identified, that is to say non-Pashtun (including non Afghan Pashtun or Pak Pashtun) - then the people are obviously in agreement with the government that these people don't belong here and need to go. 

The problem is this: the foreigners are usually in the FATA and have been there since the Soviet war times. Many of them have taken local wives and now have a family. The local have accepted them into their family. Now for the Pak govt to ask them to kick them out, the locals are thinking what am I doing to my grandchildren's father, etc. Again the edicts of Pashtunwali also play a role.

'''What is the relationship, if any, between the Taliban and Al Qaeda?'''

Al Qaeda is mostly composed of Arabs, they do not trust any one else. While they might use others as couriers or in lowly position as servants, for second rate Al Qaeda officials, the Top guys ONLY deal with Arabs and are served by Arabs. 

The Taliban are mostly Pashtun tribesmen. Mostly they are graduates of madrassa's. Mostly illiterate by any world standards. The better educated among them will know how to speak a few words of English, such as their Information minister. There might be one or two notable exceptions of which I am not aware. 

However, while Al Qaeda does not trust the Taliban, the Taliban look up to Al Qaeda top leadership. We saw this situation in Iraq where initially Al Zarqawi had no direct link with Qaeda but was keen to form one. It would be conjecture on my part to state that in the end he did indeed succeed in forming that connection. In the press at least that impression was prevalent.

So the lines of interest proceed ONE way, like one way traffic. Extremist want to be affiliated with Qaeda, in my opinion, while the latter does not, so as to maintain its hideout. 

The Qaeda supply lines are hampered, new recruits would have to be Arabs, and they would have to travel a long way through tight Pakistani security to reach here, or suffer hardship over a long and arduous land route through Balochistan and the Tribal area's - NOT all of which are accommodating. 

So as is becoming clear, Qaeda is having trouble replacing people they loose meaning those that were captured or died. They only trust Arabs, and that also a certain type of Arabs, (not all Arabs are the same, not all Arabic is the same - for example they would never trust a Syrian, in fact Qaeda folks consider Syrian brand of Islam an apostasy - but that is another story). 

Whatever remains of the Qaeda, are not in a position to set up training camps, since they are in a survival mode. The Taliban resurgence helps them get a little warm and fuzzy in this survival mode, since they feel a little bit more secure with their partners-in-arms doing some evil stuff, blowing up people and causing mayhem.

'''What makes the North-West Frontier Province competent to administer money sent as foreign aid?'''

This is the central question. Much like California has taken a separate initiative on stem cell research – as an analogy – the NWFP is central to the war on terror, not Pakistan. 

The NWFP was central to the fight and aid to the Afghans during the Soviet occupation, not Pakistan. 

This small distinction is lost on Washington, and it is the main reason, in my opinion, why so much of the Aid was "lost in transit" was because the Punjabi army officers could not bring themselves to dispense such large sums to an ethnic group which it considers anti-Pakistani. 

All the FATA is contiguous to the NWFP.  The Taliban and Al-Qaeda are holed up somewhere either in the FATA, or across the Durand Line in Afghanistan; the Durand Line has never been recognized by the locals as an international boundary. Even today, the Pashtun travel from Peshawar to Kabul by road with out a passport or visa, and it has been like that for eons.

The present governor of the NWFP belongs to the Orakzai tribe (he spells his name Aorakzai) and it is my opinion that that he was picked partly because he belongs to one of the FATA as well as he is a retired General of the Pak Army. 

The Frontier Constabulary (FC) is a force which primarily recruits from the FATA. All or most of its forces are from the various tribes. In the eyes of the tribes this is a bona fide force and service with the FC is considered an honorable thing. The US has already allocated some funds for increasing recruitment, but far less than what it would take to counter the Taliban and far less than what the economic need is. The US spends a thousand times more on a battalions sent to monitor activity over there. Plus why endanger the lives of our troops and spread our forces thin when a more effective job can be done by the FC. The FC has over history shown that they will attack and use force against the tribes that create trouble. There have been no instances of insubordination or mutiny.

Even the US Embassy is protected by a contingent of the FC! That goes to show their trustworthiness and discipline.

The "tribal" Pashtuns in the FATA are not educated or trained and hence not employable right now. I propose that we fund directly the Director of Emigrants, Mr. Azhar Arbab in Islamabad, to set up training facilities in Concrete laying, iron work, pipe work, welding etc, which would then qualify these tribesmen to obtain jobs in the Gulf. As such we would remove them from the scene altogether. They would not be available in the labor pool to the Taliban or anyone else. I might add here, that a number of these individuals have very high innate intelligence, which is one reason they make formidable foes. 

Now the central reason why the NWFP ought to do this is because they are themselves most affected by the scourge of Talibanization. They are highly motivated in carrying out these policies because it is to their own benefit. 

'''How many men does the FC field currently?'''

The FC currently has about 23,000 men in total.

'''How much do they get paid?'''

They are paid the equivalent of $60 per month per person -Pak Rupees 3665, where Rs61= $1. 
They do have some fringe benefits but life is very spartan for these soldiers. 

What the US could get in return is a huge bang for a buck, no pun intended. 

I think we ought to double the number of these soldiers with one proviso that the FC maintains its high standards of recruits.

Compare this with our costs in the War against Terror; just Halliburton’s bills will have you reeling. I think that it would be foolish, NOT to do this. 

The Frontier Constabulary is an Institution with a long and glorious history within the Frontier Province.

The recruits come strictly from the tribes of the various FATA and so they are very familiar with the people, the bad guys the terrain.

They speak the Pashto dialect of the locals. The Pashto language has many dialects, and you can tell where someone is from based on which dialect he speaks. So if you do not speak the correct dialect, you are immediately identified as an outsider. This is one reason why these tribes are impossible to penetrate, there are other reasons as well, that are beyond the scope of the current discussion.

'''How can the FC help prevent attacks like the suicide bombing attempt on [[w:Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao|Sherpao]] in Charsadda last weekend?'''

In essence your question is how can ''anyone'' prevent a suicide attack? 
And frankly if I knew the answer to that I think the US military - and several other groups - would be knocking on my door. I think the Israeli Army has had the most experience with this sort of thing. The suicide bombing as a tactical weapon was invented by the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, and even today in terms of statistics they use it in far greater numbers.

So to summarize neither the FC nor anyone else can prevent a suicide bombing. We could attempt to improve our intelligence to find out about an imminent attack, but so far these have not been very successful in Pakistan.
 
In the Lal Masjid Case the government avoided a suicide killing by negotiating with those two Mullah brothers - but I don't know if that counts. But it does make for an interesting story. Both Washington, DC and Islamabad now have Madams threatening to publish the list of their clients unless they are given protection. Who would have thunk?

Going back to your question: In my opinion what ought to be done is to make a '''Policy''' change, and address the issues that are producing these suicide bombers, that is the only way to stop this phenomenon. 

In this part of the world this is relatively new because prior to 9/11, suicide bombing was unheard of. Moreover it is not the FC's job to provide security to the Minister of the Interior, that is the job of the Police force, because this Ministry is equivalent to the Department of Homeland Security.

You don't expect Border patrol to provide body guard duty to the Secretary of the department of Homeland Security.
 
I am making these analogies so the American readers would relate to what is happening, and understand the difference in nomenclature. --[[User:RHakeem|RHakeem]] 20:13, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

UN genocide exhibit removed and put on hold after Turkey objects
{{date|April 12, 2007}}

[[Image:MURAN.gif|thumb|right|Mummified victims of the [[w:Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda genocide]].<br>Photo by Emmanuel Cattier.]]
A United Nations exhibition, entitled "Lessons from Rwanda", about the 1994 [[w:Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda genocide]], has been dismantled and postponed because [[Turkey]] raised objections to the [[w:Armenian Genocide|Armenian genocide]] being mentioned.

The Armenian genocide was carried out by the so called [[w:Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)|Special Organization]] of the [[w:Young Turks|Young Turks]], who specially elected criminals from Turkish prisons to act as escorts in the deportation of Armenians.  The Armenian genocide is the second most studied case of genocide after the [[w:Holocaust|Holocaust]]  Hitler himself occasionally referred to the extermination of the Armenians, or the lack of prosecution there of, in support for his plan to exterminate the Jews.

However, the [[w:Republic of Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] has long disputed that the event constituted [[w:genocide|genocide]], claiming rather that the Armenian deaths were a result of inter-ethnic strife, disease and famine during the turmoil of [[w:World War I|World War I]].

The exhibit was set up in the visitors lobby on Thursday and was due to be opened on Monday by U.N. Secretary-General [[w:Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]]. "Lessons from Rwanda" was created by [[w:Aegis Trust|Aegis Trust]], an anti-genocide [[w:NGO|NGO]], and approved by the U.N. Department of Public Information. The Holocaust, Cambodia, [[w:Srebrenica massacre|Bosnia]], East Timor and [[w:Darfur conflict|Sudan]] were mentioned as examples of genocide. But it also included a section entitled “What is genocide?” which read:

{{CQuote|Following World War One, during which 1 million Armenians were murdered in Turkey, Polish lawyer [[w:Raphael Lemkin|Raphael Lemkin]] urged the League of Nations to recognize crimes of barbarity as international crimes.}}

On Saturday, James Smith, the chief executive of Aegis, was told by the UN to remove the sentence. Aegis would not submit to the Secretary General’s request. Smith explains, "Had we been asked to remove reference of atrocities to Jews because Germany objected, we would have been equally resistant."

The suggestion by Armen Martirosyan, the Armenian ambassador to the UN, to remove the words "in Turkey" were also not acceptable.  Baki Ilkin, the Turkish ambassador to the UN, said that Turkey expressed "discomfort over the text's making references to the Armenian issue and drawing parallels with the genocide in Rwanda."

On Monday, the panels in the visitor's lobby had been turned around to prevent it being seen by the public.  Farhan Haq, U.N. associate spokesman, said that the review process which takes into account "all positions" had not been followed and that "the exhibition has been postponed until the regular review process is completed."  Manoel de Almeida e Silva, an official in the strategic communications division, said the exhibit would take place. "We are committed to it. It is a very important issue."

Palestinian Islamists attack children's festival in Gaza Strip
{{date|May 7, 2007}}
{{Palestine}}
[[Palestine|Palestinian]] Islamists attacked a children's festival at a [[w:Rafah Elementary Co-Ed "B" School|United Nations school]] in [[w:Rafah|Rafah]] because boys and girls were intermingled at the event which the Islamists declared was a violation of [[w:Sex segregation in Islam|sex segregation]] in Islam.

Prior to the grenade attacks and the ensuing gunfight, the Islamists issued warnings about diluting the people's Islamic faith.  Protest signs read that the [[United Nations|U.N.]] "is turning schools into nightclubs."  The gripe of the Islamists who appeared in long Islamic robes and wore beards was that the United Nations was "turning people away from [[Islam]]."

Nevertheless, U.N. officials ignored the protesters.  Later, a bodyguard of the Palestinian legislator Majed Abu Shamaleh was killed and several kids ended up injured.  The bodyguard was shot dead in broad daylight while terrified children observed the incident.  John Ging, the top U.N. official at the festival emerged un-harmed from the incident. 

John Ging believes that the security problems in [[w:Gaza Strip|Gaza]] are due to lack of money, saying "The bottom line is that security forces that we all rely on to uphold law and order have been without their regular salaries for well over a year."

According to one official who spoke anonymously, "What's new is that this group, which seems to have developed a few years ago, believes in violence if they see things they believe are wrong."

Pirate attacks bring UN aid to Somalia to a halt
<noinclude>
{{date|May 21, 2007}}
{{Somalia}}
[[Image:Merca boats.jpg|thumb|left|The [[w:Port|port]] city of [[w:Merca|Merca]] in [[w:Somalia|Somalia]] {{Image source|Tahir Turk (www.world66.com)}}]]
On Saturday, May 19, a ship chartered by the [[United Nations]]' (UN) [[w:World Food Programme|World Food Programme]] (WFP), came under attack off the coast of [[Somalia]] after making a delivery in Merca.

Two speedboats with armed guards were sent out to intercept the attack. One of these men was killed. The ship which was headed to [[w:Dar es Salaam|Dar es Salaam]] in [[Tanzania]], did not fall into the hands of the [[w:Piracy|pirates]].

Since the attack, WFP has suspended deliveries by ship. Shipping is the main and fastest way of getting food relief into Somalia. This comes just days after WFP announced that it was stepping up food deliveries.

"This attack underscores the growing problem of piracy off Somalia which, if unresolved, will sever the main artery of food assistance to the country – and to the people who rely on it for their survival," said [[w:Josette Sheeran Shiner|Josette Sheeran]], executive director of the WFP in a news release.

"Unless action is taken now, not only will our supply lines be cut, but also those of other aid agencies working in various parts of Somalia."

"WFP is very saddened and alarmed by the death of the guard, who showed great courage while the ship came under attack. We send our sincere condolences to his family," she continued. "We urge key nations to do their utmost to address this plague of piracy, which is now threatening our ability to feed one million Somalis."
{{QuoteLeft|This attack underscores the growing problem of piracy off Somalia which, if unresolved, will sever the main artery of food assistance to the country|4=Josette Sheeran, WFP}}
"We are not taking any risks after being victims four times. We planned to go to Somali this week but following Saturday's incident our ship will not sail," said Karim Kudrat who owns ''MV Rozen'', which was hijacked in February and released forty days later upon payment of ransom. 

The [[United States]] [[w:United States Navy|Navy]]'s Maritime Liaison Office (MARLO) in Bahrain has issued a warning, advising all ships to stay at least 200 [[w:Nautical mile|nautical miles]] (NM) off the coast of Somalia.

This month alone, four ships have been hijacked by pirates and three of them are still being held. Two of the ships, [[South Korea]]n [[w:Trawler|fishing trawlers]], were boarded some 210 NM off the coast, which is outside of Somalia's [[w:Exclusive Economic Zone|Exclusive Economic Zone]]. Scores of crewmembers remain hostages. The sailors are said to be from [[China]], [[India]], [[Vietnam]] and South Korea.
[[Image:Somali children waiting.JPEG|thumb|right|Somali children waiting for food aid in 1992 {{Image source|U.S. Defense Visual Information Center}}]]

"Attacks have sprung up again because we believe there is no government in place to control the militants ... when the Islamists were in power there were no attacks," Cyrus Moday, a senior analyst at the [[w:International Maritime Bureau|International Maritime Bureau]] told ''Reuters''.

An anonymous maritime security expert told ''BBC News'': "We have evidence that the pirates have a main contact in [[w:Puntland|Puntland]] and it's up to the interim government in Somalia to track and arrest the contact for taking part in an illegal syndicate." 

“In the hope of enriching themselves, these pirates are very cruelly playing with the lives of the most vulnerable women and children who had to leave their homes because of fighting. We appeal to the Somali authorities to act to stop these pirates before they cause more misery both to the crews of hijacked ships and to the people who rely on WFP food for their survival,” Peter Goossens, director of WFP Somalia, said.

Alleged pirates sometimes call themselves [[w:Coast guard|coast guards]], claiming to protect Somali waters from polluters and illegal fishing.

Iran continues enrichment in defiance of UN according to IAEA report
{{date|May 23, 2007}}
{{Iran nuclear program}}
A report by the {{w|IAEA}} says that [[Iran]] continues to defy the [[United Nations]]. The report which was prepared as the 60-day deadline in {{w|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1747}} arrives. Although the report is not yet published, both ''Reuters'' and ''BBC News'' have obtained copies. Here are some excerpts:

{{CQuote|Iran has not suspended its enrichment-related activities. Iran has continued with the operation of their pilot fuel enrichment plant.}}

{{CQuote|Unless Iran addresses long-outstanding verification issues, and implements ... required transparency measures, the Agency will not be able to fully reconstruct the history of Iran's nuclear program and provide assurances about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran or about the exclusively peaceful nature of that program.}}

In response to the report, the [[United States]] says that it will seek further UN sanctions on Iran, calling the report "a laundry list of Iran's continued defiance of the international community and shows that Iran's leaders are only furthering the isolation of the Iranian people," said {{w|Gordon Johndroe}}, Press Secretary of the {{w|United States National Security Council|National Security Council}}.

"The government in Iran is not in compliance with the resolutions of the Security Council. What we have done so far is not enough. More needs to be done. The time has come to look at additional pressure... to bring about a change in Iranian calculations," said {{w|Zalmay Khalilzad}}, the {{w|United States Ambassador to the United Nations|US Ambassador to the UN}}.

Iran has stated that it is not "hindering" the IAEA's continuing inspections, and it will continue their cooperation with the IAEA.

The newlywed daughter of [[Brunei]] [[w:Hassanal Bolkiah, Sultan of Brunei|Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah]] was presented to the public in a lavish ceremony today in [[w:Bandar Seri Bagawan|Bandar Seri Bagawan]], the culmination of two weeks of celebration, steeped in [[w:Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[w:Islam|Muslim]] tradition.

Princess Majeedah Nuurul Bulqiah, 31, the 11th daughter of one of the world's richest men, and [[w:Khairul Khalil|Khairul Khalil]], 32, an official in the prime minister's office of the tiny, oil-rich country on [[w:Borneo|Borneo]], exchanged their vows on Thursday.

[[Image:Average annual precipitation in China(English).png|thumb|right|160px|Map shows annual precipitation in China.]]
Four days of heavy rains in southern [[China]] caused flooding and landslides that have left at least 66 people dead today.

"Floods caused by heavy rains have affected about 294,800 hectares of crops, completely destroying 53,000 hectares of them," a Ministry of Civil Affairs official was quoted as saying by [[w:Xinhua|Xinhua]]. The storms have destroyed 48,000 homes and forced about 591,000 people to evacuate from their homes in [[w:Hunan|Hunan]], [[w:Guangdong|Guandong]], [[w:Guangxi|Guangxi]], [[w:Guizhou|Guizhou]], [[w:Jiangxi|Jianxi]] and [[w:Fujian|Fujian]] provinces.

With pressure from France, Chad and Sudan open door to possible troop deployment
{{date|June 12, 2007}}
{{missing image|Image:Idriss Déby headshot.jpg|right|thumb|140px|President Idriss Déby of Chad. {{Image source|Brian Smithson}}}}
After meeting Sunday with [[France|French]] Foreign Minister {{w|Bernard Kouchner}}, [[Chad]]ian President {{w|Idriss Déby}} opened the door to the possible deployment of [[United Nations]] (UN) or [[European Union]] (EU) troops to Chad's volatile eastern region. Yesterday, Kouchner met with [[Sudan]]'s President [[Omar al-Bashir]].

Until Sunday, Chad had rejected the idea of allowing military troops in to assist with security at its border with [[Sudan]]. In Chad's eastern region, the government has been fighting an insurgency, which it claims has been supported by Sudan. While dealing with the insurgency, Chad had been amenable to an international police presence, but not a military force. 

An estimated 234,000 Sudanese refugees have fled the violence in the [[Darfur]] region of Sudan and crossed the border into Chad. In addition, Chad is coping with an estimated 150,000 internally displaced persons. The conditions in the camps set up to deal with the refugees have been criticised as inadequate by the aid group, {{w|Médecins Sans Frontières}} (MSF).
[[Image:Darfur refugee camp in Chad.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Refugee camp in Chad. {{Image source|Mark Knobil}}]]
France's newly appointed foreign minister, and co-founder of MSF, Bernard Kouchner, and Chad's President Déby were able to work out some concessions on the use of foreign troops. Following the meeting, Déby was asked by reporters whether he would allow UN or EU military troops to take a role in security and stabilization measures for a humanitarian mission. "Why not," Déby replied.

Déby revealed that plans for an international force for Chad would be made public by the end of June. "We are agreed on the principle of deploying a force, but there are still some points to resolve, on which we must agree," said Déby. "The results of the discussions will be made public before the 25th of this month."

"We have been proposing this to the international community since 2004," said Déby. But Chad's Prime Minister, {{w|Delwa Kassiré Koumakoye}}, commented recently that neighbouring countries may take the use of foreign troops as a threat.

On June 9, MSF issued a press release warning of a humanitarian crisis developing in Chad. "It is imperative that the emergency in eastern Chad be fully recognised, that aid organisations provide massive, immediate aid to the IDPs and that the Chadian authorities facilitate humanitarian aid," said Isabelle Defourny, manager of MSF programmes in Chad.

===Progress in Sudan===
{{missing image|Image:Bernard Kouchner.gif|right|thumb|140px|French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. {{Image source|Photographic Dept. of the Prime Minister}}}}
Following his visit to Chad, Foreign Minister Kouchner traveled to Sudan where he met with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. Sudan has, in the past, rejected the deployment of an international force, and has resisted the use of a UN-African Union (AU) force. During their meeting Monday, al-Bashir told Kouchner that he would only accept troops from Africa.

Kouchner indicated that his meetings with al-Bashir and other officials had been productive and would "lift a certain number of complications" in obtaining agreements with Sudan. He and al-Bashir also discussed the unilateral sanctions imposed on Sudan by the [[United States]]. Kouchner felt that the sanctions haven't been useful and that the Sudanese "seem clearly affected by this issue, considering how much they raised it."

UN Secretary-General {{w|Ban Ki-moon}} expressed some optimism on the issue of troop deployment and acknowledged he received a letter recently from al-Bashir on the matter. As stated in the letter, al-Bashir has accepted in principal the idea of a UN-AU force of 23,000 troops to be stationed in Darfur. "I sincerely hope that we will be able to have early resolution of this issue," said Ban.

One roadblock may be al-Bashir's refusal to accept any force other than African. The UN and AU stated they would attempt to use only African troops, but indicated that non-African troops may be used if that were not possible.

"Darfur cannot be only an African problem," said Kouchner. "At a certain level, the respect for human rights concerns the whole world."

Judges agree on rules for Khmer Rouge tribunal
<noinclude>
{{Cambodia}}
{{date|June 13, 2007}}

[[Image:S-21 Skull Map.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A map of Cambodia, made of skulls, at the [[w:Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]] in 1997 in Phnom Penh.]]
After months of infighting, rules governing the proceedings of the first-ever trial of leaders of the genocidal [[w:Khmer Rouge|Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodia]] have been unanimously agreed upon by Cambodian and international judges in [[w:Phnom Penh|Phnom Penh]].

"These rules will ensure us fair and transparent trials," co-prosecutor Robert Petit told reporters. "Now that the rules are adopted, we can move forward."

Backed by the [[United Nations]] with a budget of US$56 million, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia was expected to start this year. But since being sworn in last July, the panel of foreign and Cambodian jurists have disputed the rules that govern the court, which stipulate such details as lawyer's fees and the height of the judge's chairs. The court is expected to start holding hearings next year and last for three years. 

One of the key issues holding up the trial was the insistence of the Cambodian Bar Association that foreign lawyers in the trial pay a fee of $2,700. International judges disputed the fee, which they said was too high and would place an undue burden on volunteer defense lawyers. As a compromise, the fee has been lowered to $500.

The Khmer Rouge, a [[w:Mao Zedong|Maoist]] [[w:Communism|communist]] regime, ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. Led by [[w:Pol Pot|Pol Pot]], the regime's plan was to redevelop Cambodia into an agrarian [[w:utopia|utopia]] that had no money, religion, schools or social classes. As many as 2 million people died of starvation or overwork in labor collectives and in genocidal purges.

Pol Pot died in 1998, but two other high-ranking Khmer Rouge officials, [[w:Khieu Samphan|Khieu Samphan]] and [[w:Ieng Sary|Ieng Sary]], are still alive and living freely in Cambodia. Both men, as are many other Khmer Rouge leaders, are old and suffering from health problems. Another leader, the military commander [[w:Ta Mok|Ta Mok]], died last year while in prison. One other leader, [[w:Khang Khek Ieu|Khang Khek Ieu]], the administrator of the [[w:Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Tuol Sleng torture center]], is in prison awaiting trial.

Many members of the current government of Cambodia are former Khmer Rouge, including Prime Minister [[w:Hun Sen|Hun Sen]].

Critics of the trial say the $56 million pricetag is too much.

Among the critics is [[w:John Gunther Dean|John Gunther Dean]], who was U.S. ambassador to Cambodia when Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rogue in 1975.

"I think the $56 million which has been collected to convict half a dozen people, would it not be much better to use that to build some hospitals under the name of 'Lest We Forget?'" he said in a recent interview with [[w:Voice of America|Voice of America]].

Youk Chhang, director of the non-profit Documentation Center Cambodia, which collects and archives Khmer Rouge records, said the money for the trial has come from voluntary donations, and does not take funds away from such things as building schools or hospitals, and will help Cambodia rebuild its rule of law.

Médecins Sans Frontières warns of emerging crisis in eastern Chad
<noinclude>
{{date|June 9, 2007}}
[[Image:Cd-map.png|thumb|right|175px|Map of Chad showing border with Sudan.]]
The non-governmental aid organisation [[w:Médecins Sans Frontières|Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders, warned of a humanitarian crisis developing in the eastern region of [[Chad]] in central [[Africa]], issued a press release Friday.

Chad, which shares part of its eastern border with [[Sudan]], has been the recipient of refugees fleeing conflict in the [[w:Darfur|Darfur]] region of Sudan. In addition to the estimated 234,000 Sudanese refugees it manages, Chad now has an estimated 150,000 [[w:Internally displaced person|internally displaced persons]], or IDPs, fleeing from attacks on villages in the eastern region where the government of Chad has been fighting an insurgency, which it claims was supported in the past by Sudan.

The Chadian IDPs are set up in rudimentary camps, lacking basic necessities such as food, water and proper shelter. According to a May, 2007 report by MSF's research and epidemiological survey centre, 20 percent of children in camps near [[w:Goz Beïda|Goz Beida]] were suffering from acute malnutrition and "catastrophic" mortality rates.  
[[Image:North Darfur IDP malnourished child.jpg|thumb|left|150px|IDP mother from North Darfur holds a 27-month-old malnourished child.]]
MSF complained of obstacles encountered in their effort to provide medical assistance to the needy. "In Goz Beida, the IDPs receive three to eight litres of water per person per day, whereas they should have 20 litres," said Franck Joncret, MSF Head of Mission in Chad. Approximately 100 children are receiving treatment for malnutrition, while MSF estimated the number of acutely malnourished children to be greater than 2,000. "This policy of rationed aid for IDPs is unacceptable," complained Joncret.

In April, the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] [[w:Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) initiated a three month intervention for the Chadian camps, which MSF described as "inadequate". MSF also complained that they have not been given approval to open a paediatric hospital in Goz Beida to help deal with the malnutrition.

In the near term, MSF anticipated an increase in [[malaria]] and epidemic [[w:Diarrhoea|diarrhoeal diseases]] along with an dramatic increase in malnutrition cases. To help avert a humanitarian crisis, MSF pleaded for increased hospital capacity, a safe water supply for the camps, and the cooperation necessary to deal with malnutrition.

"It is imperative that the emergency in eastern Chad be fully recognised, that aid organisations provide massive, immediate aid to the IDPs and that the Chadian authorities facilitate humanitarian aid," said Isabelle Defourny, manager of MSF programmes in Chad. The government of Chad has said it would agree to a UN police presence, but not a military force, in its eastern regions.

New 'clean water' funding for Djibouti's drought-stricken rural areas
{{date|July 4, 2007}}
[[Image:Djibouti Map.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Map of Djibouti, Africa.]]
With the announcement Monday of [[w:Euro|€]]2 million in new funding from the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[w:Djibouti|Republic of Djibouti's]] Ministry of Agriculture hopes to provide some relief to an estimated 25,000 rural inhabitants suffering through severe drought conditions. The money, to be channeled through [[w:United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]] for its water and sanitation program, will be used to develop new wells and improve existing ones.

UNICEF is to contribute a further €60,000, as well as technical expertise to the Ministry of Agriculture, who will carry out the bulk of the work.

“The two-year water supply project targeting rural districts is very significant since people living in 45 villages and their 40,000 heads of cattle will have access to clean drinking water,” said Joaquin Gonzalez, EU Representative in Djibouti.

At the same time, the UN aid agency [[w:World Food Programme|World Food Program]] (WFP) indicated that it is working with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to gradually shift Djibouti's reliance on emergency aid to a Food for Work program, which it hopes will assist nomadic herders in Djibouti with long-term sustainability. "What we are trying to do together with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF is, for example to dig wells so that despite drought, these herders will be able to irrigate their fields," said Simon Pluess, WFP spokesman.  "And, together with the [[w:Food and Agriculture Organization|UN Food and Agriculture Organization]], we will try and promote vegetable gardens."
[[Image:Nomads Djibouti.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Nomads in Djibouti, Africa. {{Image source|The humanitarian news and analysis service, IRIN}}]]
Djibouti has survived harsh drought conditions for the past 5 years. Groundwater is the primary source of water for drinking and irrigation, but has been difficult to exploit and is often contaminated. Almost 50 percent of people in rural Djibouti do not have ready access to properly developed source of drinking water. And, due to the ongoing drought, water availability for livestock is limited. Livestock have shown signs of distress and, subsequently, milk production is down substantially. 

Nearly half of all families in Djibouti's northwest were forced to migrate to find pasture for their livestock. As the droughts continue, the importance of properly maintained wells has become apparent. “Life is harder and harder for us. Years ago there were more rains and also more pastureland for cattle. Now it is good for us to have functioning wells so that we can keep cattle here,” said Anou Amada, farmer in the village of Andoli.

A 2006 survey indicated that only 15 percent of wells in Djibouti were equipped with a protective concrete wall to prevent contamination. Andoli's well is one of many undergoing repair through WFP's Food for Work project.

“WFP couldn’t do this alone, so we work with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to dig wells and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization for vegetable gardens,” said Benoit Thiry, Director, WFP in Djibouti.

When the project is completed in 2008, it will have increased Djibouti's water pump capacity by adding 25 solar-power pumps, which would compliment the current 61 diesel-powered pumps. "The advantage of solar...is that it is much cheaper and requires less maintenance," said Omar Habib, UNICEF communication specialist. "We want the people to participate and to appropriate these pumping stations. The government’s role in the long term should be as restricted as possible," he added.

UN calls on international community to increase aid for Iraqi refugees
{{date|July 8, 2007}}
[[Image:IRIN Refugee Jordan.jpg|right|thumb|275px|An Iraqi refugee looks out over Amman, Jordan. {{Image source|The humanitarian news and analysis service, IRIN}}]]
The {{w|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}} (UNHCR) called on the international community to increase aid and assistance to the two countries shouldering the bulk of displaced [[Iraq]]is. [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]] have received the largest number of Iraqi {{w|Refugee|refugees}} and are having difficulty coping with the numbers. 

The appeal was made by UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond at a press conference on Friday at the {{w|Palais des Nations}} in {{w|Geneva}}, [[Switzerland]]. He criticized governments for earlier expressing concern and pledging support for the refugees but not following through on promises. "Syria and Jordan have still received next to nothing in bilateral help from the world community," said Redmond.

There are an estimated 2 million Iraqi refugees total in Syria and Jordan with the numbers increasing daily. Each day, Syria receives approximately 2,000 Iraqis and, of those, about 1,000 will stay for an extended time. There are a further 2 million displaced Iraqis who move and settle in safer areas within Iraq.

The large numbers of refugees is putting pressure on the infrastructure of the host countries, resulting in difficult living conditions for the inhabitants. Ron Redmond acknowledges that some US$70 million in donations have been received by the UNHCR, and a further $10 million promised since the Iraq displacement conference in April, 2007. He points out, however, that much more is required. "We stressed then and we say it again, donors must provide direct bilateral support to these host countries whose schools, hospitals, public services and infrastructure are seriously overstretched because of the presence of millions of Iraqis they have so generously welcomed," said Redmond.
{{QuoteLeft|It is unconscionable that generous host countries be left on their own to deal with such a huge crisis. We strongly urge governments to step forward now to support them in dealing with this situation...|4=Ron Redmond, UNHCR}}
Schools are particularly difficult to set up and staff in a refugee situation. Syria has currently hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugee children, but only has resources for 32,000 students. Syria offers free access to public schools for refugees, but doesn't have the infrastructure to cope. Some 14,000 Iraqi refugee children in Jordan attend school, out of the possible 250,000. The refugee children in Jordan don't have access to public schools and instead go to private schools. UNHCR is partnering with UNICEF to provide 150,000 classroom spots in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, but the coordination of the required resources, such as buildings, teachers, and school supplies is proving difficult.

Health issues for the refugees is also a concern. UNHCR has set up three primary care medical facilities in Syria, with two more in the works. But approximately 10,000 Iraqis per month require a doctor's attention, 3,000 of which require serious medical treatment.

"It is unconscionable that generous host countries be left on their own to deal with such a huge crisis," said Ron Redmond at the press conference. "We strongly urge governments to step forward now to support them in dealing with this situation and renew our call for international solidarity and burden sharing."

The president of {{w|Refugees International}}, Ken Bacon, agrees that a more comprehensive approach to the situation is required and believes that it would be good investment for the [[United States]] to increase its aid to the region. "The United States ought to be pumping money into Jordan and Syria," Bacon suggests. He feels that the sheer numbers of refugees can have a destabilizing influence in the [[Middle East]]. However, the complicated diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Syria has resulted in slow progress, according to Bacon, as bilateral discussions have not taken place and the UN is forced to mediate.

===Jordan and Syria impose restrictions on refugees===
[[Image:Iraq NIMA 2514x2716.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Map of Iraq.]]
Both Jordan and Syria have put in place new entry and residency conditions, which has resulted in thousands of refugees being stranded on Iraq's borders. Families have been separated based on a person's age and type of passport held. Jordan and Syria have not signed on to the UN {{w|Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees}}.

The non-governmental organization {{w|Human Rights Watch}} has been critical of  Jordan and Syria on their policy of returning refugees, saying they "are violating on a daily basis the most fundamental principle of refugee protection – {{w|Non-refoulement|nonrefoulement}}, which prohibits the return of refugees to persecution or serious harm."

To gain access to Jordan, Iraqi refugees must be over 40 or under 20, and must prove they have sufficient funds to support themselves in the country. They must also be in possession of a new generation passport.

Nasser Hikmat Jaafar drove 900 km from {{w|Baghdad}} with his family to reach Jordan in mid-June, 2007. Half of his family was refused entry to Jordan. "They allowed entry just for my wife and two daughters and denied me and my three sons. They didn't tell us the reasons, but just said they are fed up with men of such ages [between 20 and 40 years old]," said Jaafar. He changed plans and traveled with all his family to the Syrian border, a distance of approximately 500 km from Iraq's Jordanian border.

Syria has less restrictions on gaining entry, but has imposed residency conditions. Refugees can only stay up to three months and must then leave Syria and re-enter to be eligible to stay for another period.

===United States Government resettlement program===
[[Image:Dobriansky.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Paula Dobriansky, U.S. Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs.]]
The United States government has a program set up for Iraqi asylum seekers in Jordan who meet specific criteria. If they meet the requirements, listed below, they may be eligible for resettlement under the {{w|Asylum in the United States|United States Refugee Admissions Program}} (USRAP).

Interested asylum seekers are encouraged to apply directly with the U.S. Overseas Processing Entity (OPE) in {{w|Amman}}, Jordan, which is operated by the {{w|International Organization for Migration}} (IOM). Individual Iraqis and their immediate family that meet one of the conditions below may seek access through the direct program:

* Individuals who worked on a full-time basis as interpreters/translators for the U.S. Government or Multi-National Forces (MNF-I);
* Locally Employed Staff (LES) engaged by the U.S. Government under the authority of the Chief of Mission or the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA); or
* Surviving immediate family members of interpreters/translators or LES.

According to the U.S. government information on the process, those individuals initiating a case with the OPE will not be guaranteed an interview for resettlement in the United States. Applicants would be screened for eligibility as per the requirements listed above and are subject to approval. 

In a February 14, 2007 press briefing, U.S. {{w|Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs}} {{w|Paula Dobriansky|Paula J. Dobriansky}} addressed the Iraq refugee crisis. "Our key immediate objectives are to assist internally displaced Iraqis and Iraqi refugees by building up the capacities of UN agencies and NGOs," said Dobriansky. "This includes increasing opportunities for permanent resettlement for the most vulnerable Iraqis, to establish specialized programs to assist Iraqis who are at risk because of their employment or close association with the United States Government, to work diplomatically with regional governments through bilateral and multilateral channels to uphold the principle of first asylum," she continued.

In the February press briefing, the U.S. committed to receive 7,000 Iraqi refugees by fiscal year end, September 30, but clarified that perhaps only half that number would be "travel-ready" subsequent to the interview process as described above. The U.S. could accommodate 20,000 to 30,000 Iraqi refugees per year without difficulty, according to Ken Bacon of Refugees International.

To date, the U.S. has allowed 750 Iraqi refugees into the country.

===Bounty for Osama bin Laden doubled===

The [[United States]] [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] has voted to double the bounty placed on the capture or death of alleged [[w:al Qaeda|al Qaeda]] mastermind [[w:Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]].

The Senate approved the bounty increase, which now sits at [[w:United States Dollar|US$]]50 million, by an 87-1 vote on Friday.

It follows a series of reports which suggest that the group of terrorists behind the [[w:September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks|September 11]] that hit [[w:New York City|New York]] and [[w:Washington, DC|Washington]] were rebuilding its capacity to execute terrorist plots.

A [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] report has indicated that investigations into the death of former [[w:Prime Minister of Lebanon|Prime Minister]] of [[w:Lebanon|Lebanon]], [[w:Rafiq Hariri|Rafiq Hariri]], have identified a number of possible suspects.

Hariri was assassinated on February 14, 2005. Explosives equivalent to approximately 300 kg of [[w:TNT|TNT]] were detonated as his motorcade drove past the St George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, [[w:Beirut|Beirut]].

The UN team, which is headed by [[w:Belgium|Belgian]] prosecutor Serge Brammertz, also said in its' report that the deteriorating political situation in Lebanon is likely to adversly effect the investigation as safety and other issues require extra attention.

North Korea shuts down nuclear reactor
{{date|July 15, 2007}}

{{North Korea nuclear program}}Kim Myong Gil, the [[North Korea]]n minister to the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]], [[New York State|New York]], claims his government has shut down its infamous reactor located in {{w|Yongbyon}} and is ready to start dismantling its nuclear programmes as long as the [[United States]] keeps its promise to remove all sanctions and remove North Korea from the terrorism list.

The 10 members of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) inspection team will be going to North Korea to verify the shut down has taken place. The inspectors were forced to leave North Korea in late 2002 when this crisis began. The [[South Korea|South Korean]] government has sent the North 50,000 tons of fuel oil as a reward for starting to dismantle its nuclear programmes and will send one million tons more. 

The South Korea's nuclear envoy Chun Yung-woo called the shut down of the Yongbyon a milestone event but said the next phase will be more difficult than the reactor shut down.

UN aid convoys face increasing attacks in Darfur
{{date|July 27, 2007}}
[[Image:Tawilla in Darfur, Sudan.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Animal carcasses rotting near the burned and looted village of Tawilla, west of El Fasher in North Darfur.]]
The [[United Nations]] (UN) [[w:World Food Programme|World Food Programme]] (WFP) raised concerns about a dramatic escalation in attacks on food aid convoys by armed bandits in the [[w:Darfur|Darfur]] region of [[Sudan]]. WFP says the attacks constrain its ability to feed the more than two million people in the area receiving aid. 

Negotiations over a UN Security Council resolution authorising a joint UN-African Union security force for the region continue but full deployment could take up to a year.

"In the last two weeks, nine food convoys have been attacked by gunmen across Darfur," said Kenro Oshidari, WFP Sudan Representative. "WFP staff and contractors are being stopped at gunpoint, dragged out of their vehicles and robbed with alarming frequency," he said. 

"These abhorrent attacks, which target the very people who are trying to help the most vulnerable in Darfur, must be brought under control," he added.

A WFP official told ''[[w:Wikinews|Wikinews]]'' that the attacks and robberies have occurred in all regions of Darfur, and that the blame can't be ascribed to a particular group. "Frequently the bandits are wearing uniforms but often in one group of bandits there may be more than one uniform. Thus, we are not pointing fingers at any one group." said Emilia Casella, WFP Spokesperson for Sudan. "We are calling on all parties to respect the neutrality of humanitarian convoys and their drivers, who are delivering food to civilians who are victims of the conflict."

{{quoteLeft|"On July 20, a convoy traveling on the Tawilla-Kaura road in North Darfur was stopped by 16 armed men. The drivers were forced out of their vehicles and the robbers demanded 5 Sudanese pounds from each (roughly equivalent to US$2.50). Those who could not pay were beaten. Similar incidents have happened on the same road in the past two weeks."|4=Emilia Casella, WFP Spokesperson for Sudan}}
According to WFP, in 2007 so far, 18 WFP convoys have been attacked - "shot at, looted, drivers robbed and/or injured". Four vehicles were stopped and the drivers and passengers robbed. Six vehicles were stolen, where the gunmen drove away with the WFP staff members still inside, though they were later released. "There were no major physical injuries, but naturally such experiences are very traumatic," said Casella. "These incidents have occurred in all three of the Darfurs, in areas controlled by various groups or the government."

In the week of July 15-21, there were five incidents in South Darfur, during which a total of seven trucks were looted of approximately 10.5 tonnes of food assistance.

The Darfur operation is the WFP's largest humanitarian mission, with about 790 staff working to feed more than two million people every month.

The WFP indicated that it has been difficult to hire and retain the commercial trucking companies used to move food and supplies throughout the region due to the risks involved in the service. WFP Public Affairs Officer in [[w:Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] Jennifer Parmelee told Wikinews that "hiring reliable transport in other insecure environments, [such as] [[Afghanistan]] and [[Somalia]], is extremely challenging."

Air service is employed for remote locations and where delivery by road has become too dangerous.

Parmelee told Wikinews that the "increasing insecurity will almost certainly further constrain [WFP's] ability to operate in Darfur - it already has." WFP Spokesperson for Sudan, Emilia Casella, indicated that "humanitarian access is likely to be increasingly difficult due to insecurity." However, the situation has not prevented all aid delivery. "Despite insecurity and access problems, WFP food assistance reached about 2.6 million people in Darfur last month," said Casella.

===Proposed African Union-UN hybrid force===
A UN resolution on the deployment of a hybrid [[w:African Union|African Union]] (AU) and UN force of 26,000 troops is working its way through the UN. [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] presented revisions to the draft, which dropped a threat of "further measures" against Sudan for obstructing peace efforts, though Sudan's ambassador, Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem, has objected to the revisions.

A deadline of December 31 exists to transfer authority in Sudan's Darfur region from the AU to the proposed AU-UN force. Full deployment of all 26,000 troops would take up to one year.

The draft resolution would allow the use of force to protect the mission's personnel and humanitarian workers and would "protect civilians under threat of physical violence".

Jennifer Parmelee of the WFP suggests that the deployment of the hybrid force under such a mandate would be a positive development in the aid agency's ability to carry out their humanitarian assistance. "Sure an expanded AU/UN peacekeeping force would help." said Parmelee. "As it is, AU is stretched very very thin, and...is unable to accompany most of our convoys."

According to WFP, there are approximately 12,000 humanitarian workers in Darfur, which is a drop in numbers even though the need for aid workers has increased.

Asian monsoon rains force millions to flee
{{date|August 4, 2007}}
[[Image:Cambodia monsoon July 2007.jpg|left|thumb|Monsoon rains in Cambodia last month.]]
Torrential [[w:monsoon|monsoon]] rains for the past 11 days have inundated parts of Southeast Asia, heavily flooding areas of [[India]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bangladesh]] and affecting over 20 million people. 

An estimated 1,400 have been killed across the region, as waterborne diseases have proliferated and become highly virulent in the humid and wet conditions. 

The United Nations Children's Fund, [[w:UNICEF|UNICEF]], is currently providing relief to affected areas. 

==India==
[[Image:indiamap.gif|140px|right|thumb|India]]

In the Northern Indian states of [[w:Bihar|Bihar]] and [[w:Uttar Pradesh|Uttar Pradesh]], as many as 12.5 million people have been displaced or affected by flooding. Clashes with police in Bihar have left 20 villagers injured and one man dead, since many are staging protests after being forced from their homes. UNICEF estimates as many as 1,103 may have died in 138 districts throughout northern India. 

Hospitals are reaching dangerous volumes as disease is sickening thousands. Many are ill from dehydration, exposure and dysentery. 

Aid workers warn that [[malaria]] is a serious risk. 

The Indian Air Force began dropping aid packages containing medical supplies and food yesterday.

Santosh Mishra, a villager in the Gondra district of Uttar Pradesh remarked, "I have not seen such flooding in the last 24 years." Bodies of two students of the [[w:IIM Indore|IIM Indore]] swept in the flash floods in [[w:Indore|Indore]] were recovered.

==Nepal==
[[Image:nepalmap.gif|150px|left|thumb|Nepal]]

UNICEF reported that 84 people have died and some 270,000 people have been displaced by floods and landslides in 32 districts in the last two weeks. Flood waters this year have remained stationary, and are not flowing as in the past, they also said. This could lead to landslides and further damage to thousands of poorly constructed adobe homes. Thousands of acres of agricultural land have already been destroyed. 

Clean water, is a primary concern, as much of the water has been contaminated with disease.

==Bangladesh==
[[Image:bangladeshmap.gif|125px|right|thumb|Bangladesh]]

Flooding has affected 41 of its 64 districts. The Associate Press reports that over 5 million have been displaced and that 46 have died. 

The capital, [[w:Dhaka|Dhaka]], has seen some flooding, but officials fear that soon the city will be completely inundated since torrential rains show no sign of abating. 

==Relief efforts==
UNICEF is working with the governments of affected nations to coordinate aid, providing water purification tablets, emergency medical supplies, and various MRE's (Meals Ready to Eat). The Nepalese ministry of finance has released additional funds for continued aid work. 

The conditions in the region do not seem promising, since more rain is forecast Saturday, and early next week.

WHO investigates outbreak of unidentified illness in Democratic Republic of the Congo
{{date|September 2, 2007}}
[[Image:LocationDRCongo.svg|right|thumb|250px|Location of DRC within Africa. {{Image source|paren=no|[[commons:User:Rei-artur|Rei-artur]]}}]]
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is investigating an outbreak of an, as yet, unidentified illness in the central region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC). To date, the illness has killed more than 100 people.

The illness, first thought to be [[typhoid fever]] but now more likely a {{w|Viral hemorrhagic fever|haemorrhagic fever}}, was first noticed in early June in {{w|Kasai Occidental}} province in the DRC. There have been 103 reported deaths from a total of 217 patients, for a mortality rate of nearly 50 percent. Health authorities are, however, unsure of the full extent of the outbreak.

In a press release, WHO described the symptoms as "fever, headache, diarrhoea or colicky abdominal pain, and vomiting." They also indicated that most of the cases have been in children under ten years of age. The time from onset to death is approximately five to seven days.

The [[United Nations]] agency, WHO, has deployed personnel to the affected areas and retrieved blood samples for laboratory testing. According to a provincial doctor, Jean-Constatin Kanow, the epidemic has affected four villages: Kampungu, Makonono, Kaluamba and Mombo, but was spreading.

Dr. Kanow described the first reported cases as involving the deaths of two village chiefs on June 8. "All the people who assisted in the burial of these chiefs have died," he said.

Authorities in the DRC, and WHO, have begun preparing for an emergency response should that be required. Measures have been put in place to control the outbreak, such as improvements to drinking water quality, {{w|hygiene}}, and the promotion of safer burial practices.

Opposition leader takes early lead in Sierra Leone presidential run-off elections
{{date|September 12, 2007}}
[[Image:IRIN ballot box sierra leone.jpg|right|thumb|275px|A woman is helped by a member of the polling staff to cast her vote at a polling station in Freetown, Sierra Leone, in first-round elections on August 11, 2007. {{Image source|[http://www.irinnews.org/ IRIN]}}]]
The results of Saturday's presidential run-off elections in [[Sierra Leone]] are being tallied, and early data indicated that opposition leader [[w:Ernest Bai Koroma|Ernest Bai Koroma]] of [[w:All People's Congress|All People's Congress]] (APC) was out front with 64 percent support. Vice President [[w:Solomon Berewa|Solomon Berewa]] of the [[w:Sierra Leone People's Party|Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP) had garnered 36 percent support, according to the country's election commission.

However, only 18 percent of the polls had been tallied so far and the election commission pointed out that the early poll results came mainly from an area in western Sierra Leone having strong support for APC. It could take up to 12 days to count all the votes. For the results that have been tabulated, voter turnout has been determined to be approximately 73 percent.

The lead-up to the run-off election had been marred by reports of violence and, on election day, monitors had observed some irregularities such as ballot box stuffing and excessive voter registrations. However, most observers, both domestic and international, agreed that the elections were carried out in an orderly fashion.

On September 2, the two presidential candidates signed a communiqué, which outlined ten "matters of concern" to be dealt with "immediately". The agreement laid out a framework for cooperation on issues such as security and a weapons ban. There was a declaration to condemn "all actions of intimidation, harassment and use of provocative language, physical violence directed at any person/persons or the malicious destruction of property for any reason."

One group of election monitors from the [[United States|U.S.]]-based [[w:National Democratic Institute for International Affairs|National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (NDIIA) expressed their satisfaction with the election process. "Despite heightened tension and several reported instances of election-related violence during the campaign period, the delegation considers that the overall electoral process was generally transparent and peaceful," said NDIIA in a statement on September 10.
[[Image:IRIN people queue sierra leone.jpg|left|thumb|275px|People queue in the rain to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections outside a polling station in Freetown, Sierra Leone, August 11, 2007. {{Image source|[http://www.irinnews.org/ IRIN]}}]]
The September 8 run-off elections followed the first round of presidential and parliamentary elections held on August 11, which were the second held since 2002 after the end of the [[w:Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]]. Opposition leader Koroma, 54, garnered 44 percent of the vote, while Berewa, 69, won 38 percent support. Should Koroma win ultimately, it would mark the APC's return to power for the first time since it was overthrown in a 1992 coup.

In a statement following Saturday's run-off elections, the spokesperson for the [[United Nations|UN]] Secretary-General [[w:Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]] expressed Mr. Ban's support for the process. "The Secretary-General is pleased to note that the second round of the presidential election in Sierra Leone took place on September 8 in a generally orderly and peaceful atmosphere, in spite of the tensions and violence that marred the campaign period. The Secretary-General urges the political parties and people of Sierra Leone to exercise restraint as counting of the ballots proceeds and to resolve all arising disputes through the existing legal channels."

Spokesman for the [[w:United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] Sean McCormack relayed the sentiment of the administration. "The United States congratulates the Republic of Sierra Leone for the peaceful presidential run-off electoral process on September 8, 2007. We commend the independent National Electoral Commission, the Sierra Leone Police, and especially the people of Sierra Leone for the overall calm and sense of order shown as voters cast their ballots."

The winning candidate will take over from current president [[w:Ahmad Tejan Kabbah|Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] who, by law, must step down after his current, second term in office.

Iran unveils part of its nuclear program
{{date|August 31, 2007}}

On August 27, [[Iran]] published public information report about its nuclear program, thus unveiling a part of outstanding issues still in discussion with {{w|International Atomic Energy Agency}} (IAEA). In this document, Tehran provide clarifications about plutonium experiments and shows signs of cooperation in clearing up questions about its efforts to acquire nuclear technology. The IAEA issued a new report on August 30, and distributed copies of its report ahead of a September 10 meeting of the organization's 35-member board.

This report also reflects findings about a work plan concluded on August 21. The [[United Nations]] nuclear watchdog report praised Iran for agreeing to a new work plan and planning to resolve numerous questions about its nuclear program. 

[[Mohamed ElBaradei]], the IAEA director general, said in reaction to these reports: "This is the first time Iran is ready to discuss all the outstanding issues which triggered the crisis in confidence. It's a significant step."

The assessment of Iran nuclear cooperation could make it more difficult for the [[United States]] and its allies to win tougher U.N. sanctions against Iran. 

In Iran, the Deputy Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) for International Affairs, Mohammad Saeedi, said that the IAEA report « put an end to all US baseless allegations on Iran's separation activities and reprocessing plutonium.»

Health organisations respond to Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo
{{date|September 16, 2007}}
[[Image:LocationDRCongo.svg|right|thumb|280px|Location of DRC within Africa. {{Image source|[[commons:User:Rei-artur|Rei-artur]].}}]]
The [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO), non-governmental aid organisation [[w:Médecins Sans Frontières|Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF), and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) have sent experts to the [[w:Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) to assist local health authorities with a recent outbreak of [[w:Ebola|Ebola haemorrhagic fever]] in [[w:Kasai-Occidental|Kasai Occidental]] province of DRC. The illness had been unidentified until laboratory test results confirmed the presence of the virus.

DRC President [[w:Joseph Kabila|Joseph Kabila]] described the situation as being contained. "The village of Kampungu has been quarantined to prevent population movement towards Kananga," Kabila said on Thursday. Kananga is the provincial capital. "The situation is at the moment, I cannot say under control, but at least the problem has been contained very well in the area," he continued. "There is no risk that the whole country will be affected."

WHO is working closely with officials from the DRC Ministry of Health and MSF to improve local facilities in order to better contain the virus. A mobile field laboratory is to be established in order to provide rapid sample analysis and, subsequently, diagnosis of patients. There are concurrent outbreaks of other diseases, such as [[w:Shigellosis|dysentery]] (Shigellosis), that have been complicating diagnoses and need to be identified as well. 

Ebola haemorrhagic fever generates mortality rates in the range of 50 to 90 percent, typically. There is currently no vaccine or effective treatment for Ebola. WHO describes the symptoms of Ebola as being "characterized by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is often followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. Laboratory findings show low counts of white blood cells and platelets as well as elevated liver enzymes."

MSF, who now have 14 experts in DRC, arranged for eighteen tons of supplies, such as medical and sanitation material, to be delivered to the province of West Kasai. MSF indicated that the transportation of supplies from the airport to the affected areas has been a challenge, due to poor road conditions. It has taken up to three days to travel the 250 km to the outbreak area from the provincial capital city, Kananga. 
[[Image:Hospital in DRC.jpg|left|thumb|275px|A patient (non-Ebola) in a public hospital in DRC, May 2006. {{Image source|[http://www.irinnews.org/ IRIN]}}]]
MSF experts will provide advice on sanitary burial procedures, which would include the use of body bags and spraying. Both the WHO and MSF will disseminate information to the local population regarding the transmission of the virus and measures that could be taken to reduce the spread of the disease. 

The MSF emergency team coordinator in Kampungu, Rosa Crestani, described the isolation ward set up at Kampungu's health centre. "Our isolation centre is basically divided in three parts. One is completely isolated, where the sick patients are; another is where the staff dresses with the complete protection uniform and then undresses after having been in contact with the patients; and the third part is a space for disinfection in between," said Crestani. "In the coming days, we will decide with the Ministry of Health and the WHO whether we set up isolation structures in other locations of the health zone."

Neighbouring countries, such as [[Rwanda]] and [[Zambia]] have issued alerts to their citizens, warning of travel to and from DRC. Zambian Health Minister Brian Chituwo stated that all people coming into Zambia from DRC will be watched for symptoms of Ebola for up to eight hours. Chituwo noted, however that it would be unlikely for an infected person to travel into the country, as the time between onset and death is very rapid and that the symptoms are severe.

There has been a minimum of 395 people affected by haemorrhagic fever, including 160 deaths, in DRC in the past few months. Since arriving in Kampungu in early September, MSF have seen 25 patients admitted with suspected Ebola haemorrhagic fever, of which eight have died.

UN Security Council extends Afghan force mandate
{{date|September 21, 2007}}
[[Image:ISAF Humvee in Khowst.jpg|thumb|300px|An ISAF humvee overlooks Khost, Afghanistan.]]
The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] has voted 14&ndash;0 to extend the mandate of the {{w|International Security Assistance Force}} (ISAF) in [[Afghanistan]] by another year.

The resolution says the Security Council agreed to, "extend the authorization of the International Security Assistance Force, as defined in resolutions 1386 (2001) and 1510 (2003), for a period of 12 months beyond October 13, 2007."

Although [[Russia]] has veto power on the Security Council, it abstained during the 14-0 vote on September 19th.  

Russian Ambassador to the United Nations, {{w|Vitaly Churkin}}, told ''RIA Novosti'' Russia abstained because of what he called, "the unexpected inclusion in the document of a sentence expressing appreciation to NATO ....  "including its maritime interdiction component." "

Part of Resolution 1776 (2007) reads, "Expressing its appreciation for the leadership provided by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and for the contributions of many nations to ISAF and to the OEF coalition, including its maritime interdiction component."

Media reports indicate this section of the resolution provides support to [[Japan]] in a domestic dispute in that country over refueling of U.S. and other ships in the Indian Ocean.  Japanese government spokesperson, Kaoru Yosano, told ''Reuters'' the resolution was welcome, adding, "It is very important that Japan's refueling activity was evaluated highly by the United Nations and members of the U.N. Security Council."

"A decision was made to give priority to domestic considerations of some members of the United Nations," Churkin told ''Agence France Presse''. "The unity of the Security Council has been sacrificed to undue haste."

Even before the Security Council vote, Japanese officials hoped the resolution would clear the way to extend a naval mission assisting [[U.S.]]-led Afghanistan military operations, showing support for Washington and averting a conflict in the Japanese in parliament as a new government begins its mandate there.

The leader of Japan's main opposition Democratic Party, Ichiro Ozawa, has opposed extending Japan's mission to refuel coalition ships in the Indian Ocean, in part because he says the activities lack a direct U.N. imprimatur.

Although expressing concerns about the resolution, and calling for future decisions on the issue to be made "by consensus", China supported the resolution.

The resolution extends the ISAF mission mandate under Chapter VII of the {{w|UN Charter}} until October 13, 2008.

Expressing its concern about all civilian casualties, the resolution, condemns "in the strongest terms all attacks, including Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attacks, suicide attacks and abductions, targeting civilians and Afghan and international forces and their deleterious effect on the stabilization, reconstruction and development efforts in Afghanistan," as well as "the use by the Taliban and other extremist groups of civilians as human shields."

The resolution also calls for ISAF coalition members to, "sustain their efforts to train and empower the National Police and other Afghan forces."  

ISAF currently has approximately 39,000 troops deployed in Afghanistan.  Its mission, as stated on the ISAF web page, is to, "conduct military operations in the assigned area of operations to assist the Government of Afghanistan in the establishment and maintenance of a safe and secure environment with full engagement of Afghan National Security Forces, in order to extend government authority and influence, thereby facilitating Afghanistan's reconstruction and contributing to regional stability."

Iranian President Ahmadinejad speaks at Columbia University
{{date|September 25, 2007}}
[[Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Columbia.jpg|thumb|320px|Ahmadinejad addresses the University.{{image credit|1=[http://dan.iella.net Daniella Zalcman]}}]]
Invited to participate in a debate at {{w|Columbia University}} during his visit to [[New York City]] this week to address the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly}}, [[Iran|Iranian]] president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] engaged University president {{w|Lee Bollinger}} on a number of topics, including his country's human rights record, opinions on Israel and the Holocaust and the role of nuclear weapons and terrorism on the global stage.  The Iranian president's speech was marked by protests, but also drew applause from students.

Bollinger opened the debate addressing critics, stating that "To those who believe that this event should never have happened, that it is inappropriate for the university to conduct such an event, I want to say that I understand your perspective and respect it as reasonable...it is an experiment, as all life is an experiment.  This is the right thing to do and indeed, it is required by the existing norms of free speech"

Bollinger then gave his opening address, turning to Ahmadinejad and stating:

{{Cquote|Mr. President, you exhibit all the signs of a petty and cruel dictator, and so I ask you, why have {{w|Iranian women|women}}, members of the {{w|Bahá'í Faith}}, {{w|homosexuality|homosexuals}} and so many of our academic colleagues become targets of persecution in your country?" 

"Why do you support well-documented terrorist organizations that continue to strike at peace and democracy in the Middle East, destroying lives and the civil society of the region? Frankly, and in all candor Mr. President, I doubt that you will have the intellectual courage to answer these questions, but your avoiding them will in itself be meaningful to us. I do expect you to exhibit the fanatical mind-set that characterizes what you say and do.}}

After reciting the {{w|Bismillah}} and asking for guidance from God, Ahmadinejad countered that "In Iran, tradition requires that when we invite a person to be a speaker, we actually respect our students and the professors by allowing them to make their own judgment and we don’t think it’s necessary before the speech is even given to come in with a series of claims..."  

Ahmadinejad's most pointed arguments, though, were directed at the administration of George W. Bush.  "They do not respect the privacy of their own people. They tap telephone calls … They create an insecure psychological atmosphere, in order to justify their war-mongering acts in different parts of the world."  

The Iranian president attacked what he considered to be errors of American imperialism.  "By using precise scientific methods and planning, they begin their onslaught on the domestic cultures of nations, which are the result of thousands of years of interaction, creativity and artistic activity. They try to eliminate these cultures in order to strip people of their identity."

Ahmadinejad questioned U.S. nuclear policy.  "Making nuclear, chemical and biological bombs and weapons of mass destruction is yet another result of the misuse of science and research by the big powers."  He added, "Without the cooperation of certain scientists and scholars, we would not have witnessed production of different nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.  Are these weapons to protect global security? What can a perpetual nuclear umbrella achieve for the sake of humanity? If nuclear war is waged between nuclear powers, what human catastrophe will take place?"
[[Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 12 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Student Sunsara Taylor saw the event as just an instrument in the larger symphony of American imperialism. {{Image source|[[User:David Shankbone|David Shankbone]]}}]]
In a rebuttal to claims that his country oppressed women and homosexuals, Ahmadinejad responded by claiming "It is wrong for some governments, when they disagree with another government, to...spread lies", pointing to the fact that over 50% of Iranian voters are female, and the two female Vice Presidents. When challenged by Bollinger for {{w|LGBT rights in Iran|Iran's treatment of gays}} he stated that "In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country," drawing laughter from the audience. "In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it."  

He framed {{w|Controversies surrounding Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|anchor=Denial of the Holocaust|questioning of the Holocaust}} as stifled academic debate: "Right now, there are a number of European academics who have been sent to prison because they attempted to write about the Holocaust or research it from a different perspective, questioning certain aspects of it," later adding that "you shouldn't ask me why I'm asking questions, you should ask yourselves why you...want to stop. Do you ever take what is known as absolute in physics? We had principles in mathematics that were granted to be absolute for over 800 years, but new science has...gone forward."

The first question from the audience addressed the controversial issue of the leader's position on Israel. Ahmadinejad did not directly respond to the subject of Israel - stating "We love all nations. We love the Jewish people. There are many Jews living in Iran, with peace and security.", and concluded that it was not a question of Israel's right to exist, but of Palestinian self-determination.  

Countering claims that his country supports terrorism, he replied, "We’re a cultured nation. We don’t need to resort to terrorism. We’ve been victims of terrorism ourselves. It’s regrettable that people who argued they are fighting terrorism — instead of supporting the Iranian nation — are supporting the terrorists and then turn the finger at us."

The final question from the audience asked whether Iran would engage in talks with the United States, to which he replied  "If the U.S. government recognizes the rights of the Iranian people, respects all nations and extends a hand of friendship to all Iranians, they will see that Iranians will be among their best friends."

In closing, Ahmadinejad extended gratitude and thanks to the University, and welcomed both students and faculty to attend Iranian universities and give lectures themselves to the students.

Protests mark Ahmadinejad's visit to Columbia University
{{date|September 25, 2007}}

The [[w:Columbia University|Columbia University]] campus in [[New York]] City erupted today in protest over President [[w:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s debate with Columbia President [[w:Lee Bollinger|Lee Bollinger]].  Ahmadinejad's presence on one of the United States' most prestigious universities brought out protesters from many causes to make their opinions known: whether Ahmadinejad should speak or not, the war in Iraq, Israel,[[George W. Bush]], [[w:American Imperialism|American imperialism]]', [[w:God|God]] and morality, all of which created a powder keg of opinions which made the air feel as if at any moment it would explode into fisticuffs. 

Ahmadinejad has been widely criticized for his [[w:Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] remarks and as a [[w:Holocaust denial|holocaust denier]], as well as [[Iran]]'s support for terrorism.  He also believes that [[w:September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] was an “inside job”, involving Israel's [[w:Mossad|Mossad]] or American ‘intelligence and security services.’  9/11 family members have been loudly critical of Ahmadinejad, since last week when he requested a visit to [[w:World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] to lay a wreath -- what has been widely viewed as a photo op.

The New York tabloid press splashed their covers with antagonizing headlines.  The ''[[w:New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' ran the headline "The evil has landed" and ''[[w:The New York Post|The New York Post]]'' labeled Ahmadinejad the "Madman Iran Prez".  Since New York hosts the headquarters of the [[United Nations]], whose charter requires that all member nations have access to the governing body, delegations of governments identified as enemies of the United States --North Korea, Cuba, Iran-- live and work in the city.  At times, their governments come to address the governing body, as the Iranian President did on Monday.  

Ahmadinejad's presence tore apart the usually close-knit community of students and academics that inhabit Columbia's enclave in [[w:Morningside Heights|Morningside Heights]].  "A high-quality academic discussion depends on intellectual honesty," wrote [[w:Columbia Law School|Columbia Law]] Dean [[w:David Schizer|David M. Schizer]], "but, unfortunately, Mr. Ahmadinejad has proven himself, time and again, to be uninterested in whether his words are true.  Therefore, my personal opinion is that he should not be invited to speak."  The Columbia Conservative Alumni Association said "the university is extending not a courtesy, but continuing a policy of anti-Israeli and anti-American leftist nihilism under the guise of academic freedom."  

Richard Bulliet, an Iranian expert at Columbia who was instrumental in arranging the visit, defended the notion that it is imperative to listen to one's enemies.  "If there is any likelihood of war between the U.S. and Iran, it is important for Americans to have some access to the direct words of the president of the other country.  At least they are getting Ahmadinejad's views directly from him and not a reporter who has an ax to grind."

Sunsara Taylor, a member of the [[w:Revolutionary Communist Party|Revolutionary Communist Party]] and a student, had a mixed view.  Although in theory Taylor did not have an issue with the Iranian President's presence on campus, she had a problem with "The event without any intervention or debate from the students...is reinforcing a bad dynamic where people feel they need to choose between Islamic Fundamentalism and U.S. Imperialism.  I think it's fine for him to speak, but I think it's a responsibility of people in this country not to be bamboozled into going along with a war against a country's people just because that country's leader is a reactionary."

Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 9 by David Shankbone.jpg|"I think  Columbia did the right thing by letting him speak, but I'm here to protest him," said [[w:New York University|New York University]] student Matt Glick, who protested on [[w:Broadway (New York)|Broadway]].  "You need a platform for people to protest them.  If you don't give a voice to these people, how can you say they are wrong?"
Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|"[Bush] is very excited about people saying we are going to attack Iran, the military option is on the table," said Columbia Languages and Culture student Sheena Shirakhon, "I think he might be offended by Ahmadinejad, but I think his bigger concern is people in this country saying we don't want a war in Iran; that makes him think his power is going to drift."
Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 6 by David Shankbone.jpg|Irving Goodson (left), a public school teacher and 1969 Columbia alumn, felt it was important to hear Amadinejad:  "I sympathize with people of Jewish descent.  I can understand their not wanting him to be here.  This may not be a good analogy, but say a person from the KKK came here advocating the extermination of blacks, I would be uncomfortable with that, but I would be interested in hearing what he had to say and in engaging him."
Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 15 by David Shankbone.jpg|"He's a terrorist. Terrorists should not have a platform to speak, simple as that," said Lily Englehart. "No right whatsoever.  He has American blood on his hands, and has no right to be here.  We shouldn't have him here.  He should have been helicoptered from JFK to the United Nations and stayed at the Iranian Consulate.  No Hilton, no Columbia."

UN report: climate change and food shortage major problems for Earth's future
{{date|October 25, 2007}}
[[Image:DjoudjNASA.jpg|left|thumb|Satellite image of Lake Djoudj comparing the September 1979 drought (left) and the November 1999 flood (right).{{Image source|NASA}}]]
The [[United Nations]] [[w:United Nations Environment Programme|Environment Programme]] (UNEP) has released a comprehensive report on the current state of the global environment. [[Climate change]], food and water shortage and a decline in biodiversity threaten humanity's survival, so urgent action is necessary, the report warns.

UNEP's ''[[w:Global Environment Outlook|Global Environment Outlook]]: environment for development (GEO-4)'' report involved the work of about 390 experts in various fields from around the world.

{{QuoteRight|1=Selected key figures and facts from the report<br/>
'''Climate change'''
*The global average temperature has risen 0.7 °C since 1906 and will rise a further 1.8 °C at best by the end of this century.
*Some scientists believe a 2°C temperature rise would cause major and irreversible damage.
*Meanwhile, average temperatures in the [[Arctic]] are rising twice as fast as elsewhere.
*Rising sealevels threaten the 60 percent of the population living within 100 kilometres of coastal lines.
'''Water and food'''
*Increasing irrigation demands will eventually cause 1 of every 10 major rivers to dry up.
*Population growth, over-consumption and a continued shift from cereals to meat will raise food demand to a level 2.5 - 3.5 times higher than at present.
*The slackening expansion of cropland stands in contrast with the fact that by 2030, developing countries will need 120 million extra hectares to feed themselves.
'''Biodiversity'''
*Species are becoming extinct a hundred times faster than the rate shown in the fossil record.}}

While the GEO-4 report salutes some improvements, for example the increased public awareness of environmental issues and political interest, it also warns that "There are no major issues... for which the foreseeable trends are favourable." Although the report sets out a gloomy scenario, its main aim is to call for action.

==Climate change==
The report finds that despite "visible and unequivocal" evidence of climate change caused by human activity, the global response is "woefully inadequate" and shows "a remarkable lack of urgency". It criticizes highly-polluting countries that refused to ratify the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]], and the industrial sectors that lobbied against it. Negotiations for a new Protocol to curb climate changes will start in December.

Although the emission of [[w:ozone layer|ozone-layer]] damaging chemicals has decreased by 95 percent, the spring hole in the ozone layer is larger than ever. UNEP calls the way [[Europe]] and [[North America]] have dealt with the problem of acid rain "one of the success stories of recent decades", while the challenge remains in countries like [[China]], [[India]] and [[Mexico]].

==Food and water==
As far as water is concerned, the report warns that "The escalating burden of water demand will become intolerable in water-scarce countries." Contaminated water and lack of sanitation services already affect 2.6 billion people, being the single leading cause of death in developing countries with 3 million deaths annually, mostly in children younger than five. Although agricultural efficacy has increased, up to a third of the global population is affected by soil erosion, nutrient depletion and water scarcity.

==Priorities per continent==
This is the first UNEP report which addresses specific problems in individual continents. In [[Africa]], desertification and declining food production are key problems, while agricultural subsidies in developing countries decrease trade profits. [[w:Bushmeat|Bushmeat]] trade is also mentioned, for example in the [[w:Congo Basin|Congo Basin]], where the trade is at six times its sustainable rate. In [[Asia]], urban air quality, fresh water and increasing waste problems are among the priorities. The illegal traffic in electronic and hazardous waste worldwide is mentioned separately as an emerging challenge.

Overconsumption, high energy use and transport problems cause concern in Europe, while North America is, according to the report, struggling to address climate change. Urban growth is a particular concern in [[South America|Latin America]]. 2007 is reported as being the first year in history when more than half of all people lived in cities. The Polar regions are already feeling the impact of climate change, ozone layer effacement and pollution.

==Wake-up call==
{{QuoteLeft|The need couldn't be more urgent and the time couldn't be more opportune, with our enhanced understanding of the challenges we face, to act now to safeguard our own survival and that of future generations.}}
[[w:Achim Steiner|Achim Steiner]], Under-Secretary General of the U.N. and director of UNEP, said that "There continue to be 'persistent' and intractable problems unresolved and unaddressed. ... Meanwhile, institutions like UNEP, established to counter the root causes, remain under-resourced and weak."

"There have been enough wake-up calls ... I sincerely hope GEO-4 is the final one. The systematic destruction of the Earth's natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged and where the bill we hand on to our children may prove impossible to pay," Mr Steiner warned.

UN's Third Commission passes resolution condemning capital punishment
{{date|November 17, 2007}}
[[Image:United Nations HQ - New York City.jpg|thumb|200px|UN Headquarters in New York.]]
Yesterday, the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly}}'s Third Commission passed resolution L29 against {{w|capital punishment|capital punishment}}; the project was presented by [[New Zealand]] and [[Brazil]], and was defended vigorously by [[Italy]]. With 99 votes in favor, 52 against and 33 abstentions, the necessary majority was met, needed in order to pass the resolution.

Italy had proposed a resolution against capital punishments several times&nbsp;&ndash; in 1994, 1999, and in 2003&nbsp;&ndash; but had been denied in all cases. {{w|Massimo D'Alema}}, Italian Minister of State and Vicepresident of the Council, did not hold and expressed his content towards the result:

{{cquote|The Third Commission's vote constitutes a decisive step towards the definitive adoption of the resolution by the Plenary General Assembly, that would have to happen by the month of December. Italy confirms to be at the forefront regarding protection of human rights. The fight against capital punishment at an international level is one of the priorities in foreign policy, that attracts the government, institutions, political-parliamentary forces, and non-governmental organizations in a campaign [...] and we are convinced that it has produced a first relevant result.}}

Health experts suspect bromide poisoning in Angolan disease outbreak
{{date|November 26, 2007}}
[[Image:Angola-Pos.png|right|160px|thumb|Location of Angola within Africa.]]
Health authorities from the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the government of [[Angola]] have revealed that bromide poisoning may be the source of a mystery illness first reported in early October.

The outbreak of over 400 reported cases of a neurological disorder was centred in the [[w:Cacuaco|Cacuaco]] district of Angola's capital city [[w:Luanda|Luanda]]. A majority of the afflicted have been children under the age of 15. There have been no deaths attributed directly to the disorder.

According to a statement in the state-run ''AngolaPress'', symptoms have included "sleepiness, blear-eyedness, dizziness and difficulty to speak, walk and extreme tiredness." WHO described the drowsiness as being so severe that the patient would require "painful stimuli" to be awoken.
[[Image:Sodium bromide.jpg|left|130px|thumb|Sodium bromide.]]
Results from laboratory tests carried out in [[w:London|London]] and [[w:Munich|Munich]] indicated elevated levels of bromide present in the blood and kitchen salt samples examined. It is suspected that [[w:Sodium chloride|sodium chloride]] (table salt) may have been contaminated with sodium bromide, an agent used in pharmaceuticals and industry.

However, authorities caution that more investigation is required to determine the source and cause of the illness. Consequently, further testing of blood, food and water has been initiated.

On Wednesday, WHO dispatched additional technical and support personnel to Angola to assist local health officials.

Climate conference in Bali begins on Monday
{{date|November 29, 2007}}

This year's session of the "United Nations Climate Change Conference", which includes meetings of the [[w:United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#COP-13.2C_Bali.2C_Indonesia|COP and CMP]], begins next week in [[w:Bali|Bali]], [[Indonesia]]. The Conference is the place where formal decisions regarding the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]] will be made and discussed. Several participants and observers agree that getting on track for a regulatory agreement on [[w:greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions for 2012 onwards is going be one of the main challenges in the upcoming talks.
{{quoteLeft|I read occasionally in newspapers that people expect Bali to agree on targets and finalise a regime. That's not my expectation.|4=Yvo de Boer}}
Setting an agenda and a date for completion of negotiations on a post-2012 climate change agreement at the upcoming conference in Bali is of great importance, stated Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the [[w:United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) in an interview given to [[w:Inter Press Service|Inter Press Service]] last week. De Boer declared that he does not "expect Bali to agree on targets and finalise a regime", and sees the real work in "designing a global agreement that encompasses every country while recognising the need of different approaches with different people" during the short span of the next two years. However, making the decision to launch negotiations is a prerequisite to this, and in that regards he says that "...for me Bali is very much a make or a break."

The [[w:European Commision|European Commission]] said in a press release from Tuesday: "The [...] conference [...] must agree to launch negotiations on a comprehensive and ambitious global climate change agreement for the period after 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period ends."

The Prime Minister of the [[United Kingdom]] [[Gordon Brown]] stated in a speech that "the task of Bali sounds quite specific: to launch negotiations leading to a post-2012 global agreement on climate change. But our mission is in truth historic and it is world changing&mdash;to build over the next 50 years and beyond a global low carbon economy."

The [[United States]] seems to agree as the [[w:United States Department of State|Department of State]] noted in a press release that "we are committed to developing an environmentally effective and economically sustainable post-2012 framework to address climate change."

In its information for the press, the UNFCCC secretariat states that the latest [[w:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) report made it unmistakenably clear that the problem and danger of global warming needs to be tackled immediately, and with a world wide response. While the Kyoto Protocol includes reduction targets for the signatory developed nations through 2012, the communique says that a "new international climate change deal must be put in place" so that no time gap occurs between the current measures to reduce GHGs until the end of the current phase and those measures that will be applied thereafter.

Bali climate change conference begins
{{date|December 3, 2007}}
[[Image:Bali 2007 Conference flags.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Conference entrance {{image credit|[http://www.flickr.com/people/14071207@N00 OpenDemocracy]}}]]
Representatives of more than 180 nations gathered on the [[w:Indonesia|Indonesia]]n island of [[w:Bali|Bali]] today to kick off a [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]-sponsored conference on global [[w:climate change|climate change]]. The U.N. hopes the meeting will conclude with a road map toward a new agreement on reducing the types of air pollution many scientists believe are driving changes in the earth's climate.

The Bali meeting aims to get countries to commit to working out a new agreement on emissions cuts to extend or replace the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]], which expires in 2012. Conference president [[w:Rachmat Witoelar|Rachmat Witoelar]] of Indonesia told reporters that a detailed proposal is not necessary at this stage, but participation by all nations is vital.

"We will be happy if this Bali road map is general so we will not push for a very detailed in this short time," he said. "The introduction, the process is important."

As the conference opened, [[Australia]]'s new prime minister, [[Kevin Rudd]], signed the Kyoto Protocol, limiting his country's [[w:greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas]] emissions. That act earned a standing ovation in Bali, and focused attention on the failure of the [[United States]] to sign the protocol - the only developed nation not to have done so.

"While the current U.S. delegation will not join in serious negotiations over mandatory limits on global warming pollution, they won't be around when the final deal is made in 2009. A new team will be on the field with a very different game plan," he said. "The other nations must not allow the U.S. to derail, delay or water down the Bali mandate."

Senior U.S. negotiator [[w:Harlan Watson|Harlan Watson]] denied his country was blocking progress, saying the U.S. had merely chosen a different course.

"It's up to each country to do the analysis and analyze for themselves if the target is do-able. Obviously the U.S. came to a different conclusion," he said. "We respect the decisions other countries have made and of course ask them to respect the decision that we've made."

[[George W. Bush|President Bush]] says that the Kyoto Protocol threatened U.S. economic growth, and believes that any future climate-change agreement will be ineffective unless it includes rapidly developing nations such as [[China]] and [[India]], which are among the world's largest producers of greenhouse gases.

Other subjects on the agenda in Bali include saving the world's remaining forests, and sharing technologies to help developing nations grow in less-polluting ways. The U.N. also hopes to finalize a fund to help countries affected by global warming to cope with the impacts. The money could go toward flood-proof houses, better water management, and crop diversification.

The Bali conference will continue until December 14. Thousands of government representatives, scientists and activists are attending.

Calls for "critical breakthrough" in the opening speeches of Climate Conference in Bali
{{date|December 3, 2007}}

The freshly elected president of the World Climate Change Conference [[w:Rachmat Witoelar|Rachmat Witoelar]], [[Indonesia]]n Minister of the environment, as well as his predecessor, [[w:Nabiel Makarim|Nabiel Makarim]], and Yvo de Boer of the [[w:United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]], called for a breakthrough in negotiations on the first day of the 13th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in [[w:Bali|Bali]] today. 
[[Image:Bali Conference Inside.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Inside the conference centre {{image credit|[http://iisd.ca IISD/ ENB-Leila Mead]}}]]
All three speakers agreed that by the end of the conference, which lasts till the 14th of December, an agenda must be set for negotiations on a post-2012 agreement on climate change mitigation. In founding this demand, they each drew on the [[w:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]'s [[w:IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]], which establishes that the window for mitigating dangerous climate change closes in year 2030<!-- I only glanced at the report but they see 2030 as a pivotal year, please double check -->.

The outgoing President of the last session, [[w:David Mwiraria|David Mwiraria]], [[Kenya]]n minister for environment and natural recources, held the first speech making some statements on his term of office. He went on to remind that the least developed, many of which are [[Africa]]n nations and the small island states, are the ones that will be hit hardest by global warming, now and in the future.

The new president of the conference, Mr Witoelar, Indonesian minister of the environment agreed with that statement, saying that the "most severe impacts [...] will be felt by poor nations, and the poorest within them" and drew the conclusion that it is "critical that we act, and act now." Looking at the chances for the so-called ''Bali roadmap'' being agreed on, he noted that from consultations he had "heard that there was widespread support from governments" for making this happen. He went on to say that "Many have also expressed support for a target date of 2009". 

As the two speakers before him, Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC noted that 2007 had been a exceptional year regarding climate change, with multiple political high level meetings being held. He went on to say that the delegates should reach agreement on a multitude of issues that had only been in discussion up until now. Amongst others, these included the organizational questions regarding the Adaptation Fund, which is aimed at funding measures that will increase the adaptive capacity of nations with developing industries<!-- Thats what I think it is, I must admit I´m not entirely sure -->. Reaching agreement on these issues would allow their substance to be implemented, and at the same time "free up the negotiation capacity needed for the post-2012 process".

Finally, he addressed the matter of whether the targets that are to be set by 2009 are to be internationally legally binding or not, an issue that the [[United States]] is particularly sensitive about<!-- this (the US matter) screams for a source, doesn´t it; maybe I need to reword, but its correct in general -->. He stated that in his opinion form follows function, making an allegory to the targets needing to be set before agreement being reached on how they are to be mandated <!-- is that the right word ?-->.

<!-- some general explanations on the IPCC and maybe the Kyoto or post 2012 agreement being strived for would be good I guess (but I´m not going to get round to it -->

Climate change threatens world's poorest says Oxfam
{{date|December 4, 2007}}
[[Image:Bali 2007 Conference flags.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Conference entrance {{image credit|[http://www.flickr.com/people/14071207@N00 OpenDemocracy]}}]]
The anti-[[w:poverty|poverty]] group [[w:Oxfam|Oxfam]] says [[w:global warming|global warming]] is altering the human food supply and threatening some of the world's poorest people with hunger. At the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] [[w:2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Conference on Climate Change]] in [[w:Bali|Bali]], the group argued [[w:developed countries|developed countries]] should pay to address the problem, and costs could top $50 billion a year. 

Climate change, which many scientists believe is fuelled by human activities, alters rain cycles and causes increased droughts and flooding. Rising temperatures mean some traditional crops do not grow as well as they used to. The United Nations predicts that in some [[Africa]]n countries, crop yields could fall by half.

Oxfam researcher Kate Raworth says coping with these issues will be expensive.

"Oxfam has estimated that for all developing countries to adapt to climate change will cost at least $50 billion a year," she said. "And for that to be done with justice we believe that the rich and the most polluting countries should pay the vast share of the money to make possible for those countries most vulnerable and least responsible for causing the problem to cope with the new realities they have to deal with."

The report released by Oxfam at the conference on Tuesday says some countries are already feeling the effects of a warming planet. In [[South Africa]], farmers are planting faster-maturing crops to adapt to unpredictable rainfall.

[[Bangladesh]]is are creating floating vegetable gardens that can thrive in spite of floods. But Mozaharul Alam, who heads Bangladesh's climate adaptation effort, says overall improvements to the food system still leave many families vulnerable.

"Most of the agriculture is subsistent in nature," said Alam. "So if [there is] any failure of the crop on the ground, even if there is food available in the market, unless the people has the buying capacity, that availability of the food in the market has no meaning to the vulnerable family."

Oxfam argues the [[United States]], the [[Europe|European Union]], [[Japan]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] should be among the major sources of funds to help developing countries solve their climate change problems.

These countries have agreed in principle, but one task of the Bali Conference is to find out how much individual countries are willing to spend on climate-related issues. It also aims to begin deciding how to divide those resources between prevention of further climate change, and adaptation to the changes that are already taking place.

The conference involves thousands of scientists, government officials and development group representatives, and runs for another 10 days.

Developing nations bring technology transfer on agenda against resistance of Canada, Japan and US
{{date|December 4, 2007}}

A sub-body of the World Climate Change Conference today took up the item of "Development and transfer of technologies" <!-- hope I'm not mistaken on the name, I got it from the agenda of a different body, so not sure--> on its Agenda, and subsequently decided to establish a contact group to speed up negotiations. Both the declaration of the new Agenda item, as well as the setting up of the Contact group, came after lengthy discussions that were polarized between the Group of 77 + China (G77+C), which is comprised of about 130 nations with developing industries, and the Umbrella group, which consists of most of the nations with highly industrialized economies, but the EU countries. <!-- nice and pov ? I might try to go for more neutral later, but any drier and its going to be very boring I reckon-->. 

The sub-body, called the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) is, as its name implies, amongst other things responsible for preparing and implementing decisions of the main body of the [[w:UNFCCC|UNFCCC]], the Conference of the Parties (COP). After having spent a large part of the morning discussing formalities regarding whether or not technology transfer was to be taken up as a separate item, the afternoon session had to be extended till around 9 pm local time. Even then some of the planned agenda items had not been concluded when the session closed.

The cause for discussion in the morning were two different interpretations of a decision the COP made yesterday: Member states of the G77+C believed that the referral of the item of tech transfer by the COP automatically lead to its inclusion on the agenda as a separate item, while the Chairman of the SBI and the US voiced the opinion that to for it to be included, the item would have to be formally agreed upon in the normal manner. Compromise, of one sort or another, could not be reached, and it was only after a legal adviser stated that in his point of view the item indeed was necessarily included on the agenda as a separate item that the matter could be concluded.

Due to the stalling in the mornings session, discussions on the actual item of technology transfer began after what would have been the scheduled closing time. South Africa <!-- didn't catch this, so don't know if on behalf of G77+C --> made the proposal to set up a contact group for the item, so that it could be discussed in a setting with less participants in an informal way. A number of G77+C nations (including China and Nigeria) spoke out in support of this proposal, emphasizing that rapid progress was needed on the issue. Japan, and the US made critical statements, noting that they believed that the scope of the contact group should first be established, and that it would be more sensible to establish the contact group in 2008. After it was found that the group would nevertheless be established, the Chairman asked for suggestions for Co-chairs of the group, as one from the Annex I and one from the non Annex one would be required. The non-Annex I having already decided that they supported Prof. Philip M. Gwage from Uganda as Co-chair, the Annex I countries decided that Jukka Uosukainen from Finland would be the Co-chair on their behalf after brief deliberations. The decision being reached provoked some applause from delegates and observers, and the session was closed shortly thereafter.

Opening positions spark debate at Global Climate Change Conference
{{date|December 5, 2007}}
[[Image:Bali Conference Inside.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Inside the conference centre {{image credit|[http://iisd.ca IISD/ ENB-Leila Mead]}}]]
At the [[w:U.N.|U.N.]] [[w:2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|conference]] on Global [[w:Climate change|Climate change]] in [[w:Bali|Bali]], the early talk has focused on whether some of the major [[w:developed countries|developed countries]] will commit to cutting [[w:greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas]] emissions in the coming years. [[Europe]]an states are pushing for steep reductions in emissions, but environmentalists accuse some others of dragging their feet. 

The European Union's climate chief, [[w:Artur Runge Metzger|Artur Runge Metzger]], says his organization wants greenhouse emissions cut by half by the middle of the century.

"We would like to see global average temperatures rise no more than an average of two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels," Metzger said. "And that would require that global emissions go down by at least 50 percent of the 1990 emissions by the year 2050."

Greenhouse emissions are thought to be causing [[w:global warming|global warming]]. Metzger downplayed differences between the EU and other countries on reduction targets, saying he believes the response to the 50 percent proposal has been increasingly positive. He noted that [[Japan]], [[Canada]] and some members of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[w:congress|congress]] have expressed support for the idea.

Those same countries, however, have been targeted by environmental groups, who say they have failed in their initial statements here to come out strongly enough for significant cuts. [[w:Hans Verolme|Hans Verolme]] of the group [[w:WWF|WWF]] says Japan is being criticized for not including binding targets in its proposal for emission control discussions.

"That in our view would be quite disastrous. It would delay action and it would in fact lead to dangerous climate change," Verolme said.
[[Image:Bali 2007 Conference flags.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Conference entrance {{image credit|[http://www.flickr.com/people/14071207@N00 OpenDemocracy]}}]]
Japan says its proposal is merely an attempt to get the conversation started, and U.N. climate change chief [[w:Yvo de Boer|Yvo de Boer]] has also sought to downplay any differences. De Boer repeatedly points out that the Bali conference is not meant to produce a new climate-change treaty to replace the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]]. That 1997 agreement is set to expire in 2012.

"This meeting in Bali will not finalize a post-2012 climate change deal, that's much too complicated to do in 10 days, but what it can do is put in place a two-year process to work towards such a deal," De Boer said.

Even the two-degree temperature rise that the European Union talks about is predicted to have serious effects on humans and the environment. The U.N.'s [[w:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has predicted such a rise would increase the frequency of damaging storms, and make 30 percent of the world's species more vulnerable to extinction.

Thousands of delegates from more than 180 countries are meeting in Bali, which is due to run through December 14.

Scientists take strong stance for cutting emissions at Climate Conference in Bali
{{date|December 6, 2007}}

[[Image:Climate change research centre logo.jpg|right]]

A group of over 200 scientists have signed a document demanding that political action be taken following the scientific evidence that had been put forth in the last International report on climate change. The document, that had been drafted by the [[w:Climate Change Research Centre|Climate Change Research Centre]] at the [[w:University of New South Wales|University of New South Wales]] in [[Australia]], was presented today at the [[w:2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Convention on Climate change]], the scientists wanting to give a strong signal to the currently ongoing negotiations. 

Unlike the [[w:IPCC|International Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), which tries to assess the current situation and what the future trends are, the [[w:2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2007 Bali Climate Declaration by Scientists]] makes explicit recommendations to policy makers. These are twofold, one regarding the current Conference, and one future goals. On the talks here at [[Indonesia|Bali]], the Declaration says it is necessary that "a new global climate treaty [...] needs to begin in December 2007 and be completed by 2009". It went on to say that "The primary goal of this new regime must be to limit global warming to no more than 2 °C", and that [[w:greenhouse gas|emissions]] would need to be cut to 40% or less than 2004 levels in order to be able to reach that goal.
{{wikipediapar|2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference}}
Asked by which means these reductions could be achieved, Professor [[w:Richard Somerville|Richard Somerville]] from the [[United States]] answered that only a combination of technological advances and lifestyle changes would be sufficient to attain the proposed emission levels. 

The declaration, which is only about a page long, and its signatory list can be found at the Climate Change Research Centre's website (see below).

US Senate Panel approves bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
{{date|December 6, 2007}}
[[Image:Uscapitolindaylight.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[w:United States Capitol|US Capitol]] building {{image credit|[[w:User:Kmccoy|Kmccoy]]}}]]
A [[United States|United States]] [[w:United States Senate|Senate]] committee has passed landmark legislation aimed at combating [[w:global warming|global warming]] by limiting [[w:CO2|carbon dioxide]] emissions. The vote was timed to coincide with the [[w:United Nations|U.N.]] [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|conference on climate change]] taking place in [[w:Bali|Bali]], [[Indonesia]]. 

The bill would set caps on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electric utility, transportation and manufacturing industries beginning in 2012 with the goal of cutting emissions 60 percent by 2050. It would create an incentive system that would give credits to industries that cut pollution. Industries that failed to reduce emissions would be forced to buy credits from others.

The [[w:Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-led [[w:United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]] voted eleven to eight, largely along party lines, to send the measure to the full Senate for what supporters hope will be action early next year.

"We are facing a crisis that will hit our children and our grandchildren the hardest if we do not act now. Not to act would be wrong, cowardly, and irresponsible," said [[w:Barbara Boxer|Senator Barbara Boxer]], a [[California]]n Democrat, chairwoman of the committee.

Senator Boxer, who is expected to travel to Bali as part of a [[w:United States Congress|U.S. congressional]] delegation next week, said committee approval of the bill sends a signal to the rest of the world that the United States is serious about reducing global warming.

But many [[w:Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] oppose the legislation, saying it would increase energy costs and lead to job losses. They argue the measure does not ensure that other nations, particularly [[China]] and [[India]], will cut emissions.

"China's emission will continue to accelerate as it builds coal plants and imports jobs from the United States. This will be enormously expensive to households within seven years as electricity prices skyrocket by 35 to 65 percent," said [[w:Jim Inhofe|Senator James Inhofe]] of [[Oklahoma]], the top Republican on the committee.

But co-sponsor Republican [[w:John Warner|Senator John Warner]] of [[Virginia]], who broke with many in his party to support the measure, offered a different view: "If we do not act, China and India will hide behind America's skirts of inaction and take no steps of their own. Therefore we simply have to lead," he said.

The [[w:United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has yet to draft its own version of the legislation.

Climate change talks continue in Bali
{{date|December 7, 2007}}
[[Image:Bali conference inside.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Inside the conference centre. {{image credit|[http://www.flickr.com/people/8470194@N02 Oxfam International]}}]]
The [[w:2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Bali is nearing its halfway mark. Senior delegates are hopeful an international agreement will be reached on how to control harmful [[w:greenhouse emissions|climate emissions]] when the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]] expires in 2012, but environmental activists fear the talking is taking too long. 

Delegates in [[Indonesia|Bali]] hope to begin drafting a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to contain [[w:global warming|rising global]] temperatures. Many scientists believe the emissions contribute to a rise in global temperatures.

[[w:Yvo de Boer|Yvo de Boer]], the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]' climate change chief, told reporters Friday that over the past two days, the mood at negotiations has been positive.

Asked to provided a concrete example of progress, he said a special working group of delegates has agreed that any future agreement should include ways to encourage countries such as China and India to develop environmentally friendly practices as their industries and economies grow.

"So they've gone into an in-depth discussion on mitigation, and have come to the conclusion that really a strong focus needs to be on putting in place incentives for developing countries to mitigate climate change. That came up very strongly. That, to me at least, is a good indication that the mood is good, people are at work," said de Boer.

But environmentalists have not been as optimistic about progress in this week's negotiations.

Also today the [[w:Greenpeace|Greenpeace]] ship the [[w:Rainbow Warrior|Rainbow Warrior]] arrived in Bali.

Earlier this week, [[Japan]] took a position similar to the [[United States]] in proposing that any new agreement should favor voluntary emissions targets instead of mandatory ones. The two nations believe that binding emissions caps would threaten the economic growth needed to fund technology used to fight global warming.

[[w:Hans Verlome|Hans Verlome]], director of the [[w:World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund]]'s Climate Change Program, urged the U.S., Japan and others to take more decisive action in light of a report from the [[w:IPCC|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] that found global warming is occurring and is likely caused by humans.

"We did not come to Bali to just have another process, and we have two years of talks. It is time to get on with it," said Verlome. "The IPCC report has delivered the results that are necessary to inform decision making, and the decision making is here, now."

Verlome and other environmentalists say [[China]] has taken a leading role in negotiations this week. China wants wealthy countries to help spread technology for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in poor countries.

[[w:Harlan Watson|Harlan Watson]] of the U.S. delegation reaffirmed his country's opposition to mandatory caps on carbon emissions, but said the U.S. would be open and flexible.

"The U.S. is committed to advancing negotiations, and developing a Bali roadmap, that will guide negotiations on a new post-2012 global climate change regime that is environmentally effective and economically sustainable," he said.

Delegates are on schedule to begin drafting proposals early next week. Environment and trade ministers are scheduled to meet over the next few days.

Forest preservation plan debated at climate talks
{{date|December 8, 2007}}
[[Image:Bali conference inside.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Inside the conference centre. {{image credit|[http://www.flickr.com/people/8470194@N02 Oxfam International]}}]]
Delegates at the [[w:2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Indonesia]] are wrestling with a proposal that would allow developing nations to earn billions of [[w:US Dollar|dollars]] through [[w:carbon trading|carbon trading]] by leaving idle forests such as those in [[w:Borneo|Borneo]], the [[w:Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and [[w:Congo|Congo]] basins. 

The news comes on the same day that it was announced that forest clearance in the Amazon Rainforest was falling compared to previous years.

Delegates from about 190 countries are negotiating a plan for private companies and wealthy nations to pay poorer nations to keep their forest intact. It is called the [[w:Reduced Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries|Reduced Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries]], or REDD proposal.

Environmental scientists say tree cutting in tropical areas accounts for about 20 percent of all man-made [[w:CO2|carbon dioxide emissions]] blamed for [[w:global warming|global warming]]. Tropical forests soak up vast amounts of carbon dioxide; burning timber to clear land releases it.

Marcelo Furtado with [[w:Greenpeace|Greenpeace]] in [[Brazil]] says the REDD plan is needed to fill gaps in the current [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]], an international agreement to limit emissions of [[w:greenhouse gases|greenhouse gases]] which does not include ways to preserve forests.

"We would like to see, at the very least, a REDD mechanism moving forward, because we want to see countries taking action now. We don't want to wait to 2013 to start seeing this action taking place. And this is something this convention, this group of countries could deliver," said Furtado.

Frances Seymour, Director General for the Indonesia-based Center for International Forest Research, is concerned a premature REDD agreement could do more harm than good.

"Because in many forested countries, land tenure rights to forest lands and resources are either unclear or contested or both. And you can imagine that if a potential new income stream is available for those who can present themselves as owners of the forest, this could create conflict and create conditions under which some of the world's poorest people, who are people who live in forests, could be pushed aside," said Seymour.

Financial analysts are also cautious about the proposal.

Charlotte Streck, the director of [[w:Climate Focus|Climate Focus]], a Rotterdam-based consultancy, said investors are worried about how governments would monitor their forests and ensure the carbon stored in them remains intact.

"This is what makes the private sector nervous, because these are risks that they cannot hedge properly, and that they cannot evaluate in the same manner as the project related risks," she said.

Conference delegates are still debating how to monitor the world's remaining tropical forests, how to stop logging in one place without shifting the problem to another area, and how to estimate the amount of carbon in a piece of land.

Yvo de Boer, the U.N.'s climate change chief, said a REDD agreement is unlikely during this conference, but a group working on the details is making significant progress.

Nobel prize winner Al Gore urges US and China to do more about global warming
{{date|December 10, 2007}}
[[Image:Al gore nobel.jpg|thumb|left|[[w:Al Gore|Al Gore]] accepting the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] today. {{image credit|Kjetil Bjørnsrud}}]]
[[w:Global warming|Global warming]] campaigner and former U.S. Vice President [[w:Al Gore|Al Gore]] says it is time for humanity to stop "waging war" on planet Earth.

Gore spoke today in [[w:Oslo|Oslo]] after receiving the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. He urged the two largest carbon-emitting countries - the [[United States]] and [[China]] - to make what he called the "boldest moves" to fight global warming.

The United States has not ratified the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]], the 1997 international pact that requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. China was not required to reduce emissions under the deal.  They also refused today to approve a new treaty designed to cut emissions by 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020.

Gore said he would go to the [[w:U.N.|U.N.]] [[w:2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|climate meeting]] in [[Indonesia|Bali]] later this week to urge world leaders to meet as often as every three months to enact a global cap on greenhouse gas emissions by 2010.

Gore shared the 2007 Nobel prize with the [[w:IPCC|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], represented at today's ceremony by [[w:Rajendra Pachauri|Rajendra Pachauri]].

Pachauri stressed the link between the fight against climate change and peace. He warned that severe climate change will trigger what he called "dramatic population migration," as well as war over water and other resources.

He also warned that up to 250 million people in [[Africa]] could face what he called "increased water stress because of climate change.

Greenhouse-gas emission targets may come later says Ban Ki-moon
{{date|December 12, 2007}}
[[Image:Bankimoon07052007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[w:U.N.|U.N.]] secretary-general, [[w:Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]]{{image credit|Marcello Casal Jr./ABr}}]]
The [[United Nations]] secretary-general, [[Ban Ki-moon]] says setting [[w:greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emission targets may have to wait until after the [[w:2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|U.N. Climate Change Conference]] being held in [[Indonesia|Bali]].

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon told reporters it may be too "ambitious" to set targets for greenhouse-gas emissions in the draft text of an agreement aimed at replacing the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]] to stop [[w:global warming|global warming]].

Delegates from about 190 nations, now holding high-level meetings, are split over whether targets should be set now or later. Mr. Ban recognizes the divisions.

"Frankly speaking, realistically, it may be too ambitious if delegates would expect to be able to agree on target of greenhouse gas emission reduction," he said. "But, as I told you, some time down the road we will have to agree on that."

Ministers and heads of states, in a series of speeches, urged nations to lower greenhouse gas emissions. These gases, particularly those caused by the burning of [[w:fossil fuels|fuels]], are believed by many scientists to contribute to global warming.

Leaders said rich nations should make the first cuts and help poorer nations to develop clean technology.

The [[United States]] strongly opposes emission targets, as do [[Japan]] and [[Canada]]. U.S. officials say including emission targets would prejudge negotiations expected over the next two years to find a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.

But the [[European Union]] and environmentalists say setting emission targets in the draft will show that industrialized nations are serious about the fight against global warming.

The U.S. under-secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, [[w:Paula Dobriansky|Paula Dobriansky]], who is heading the U.S. delegation to Bali, says [[w:Washington|Washington]] is committed to seeing an agreement reached at the Bali conference.

"We are very committed to working toward a successful outcome here in Bali. We want to launch a process that is open and does not predetermine or preclude options," she said. "We have been listening carefully to the perspectives of others and will continue to do so in the days ahead. We hope to identify a way forward that will bridge our differences and bring us together on common pursuit of our shared goal of addressing climate change."

The text of the conference draft is expected to undergo several revisions before being finalized Friday. It calls for industrialized nations to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 to 40 percent by the year 2020.

The Bali conference is expected to end on Friday.

Climate Negotiations soon to conclude in Bali; UN "concerned by the pace of things"
{{date|December 13, 2007}}

After almost two weeks of negotiations, this years United Nations Convention on Climate Change ([[w:UNFCCC|UNCCC]]) is soon going to end, Friday being scheduled as the last day of the talks, with an extension until Saturday being possible if agreement can not be reached beforehand. 

While the head of the UNFCCC Secretariat, Yvo de Boer, stressed from the onset that actual targets for emission reductions were not to be expected to be agreed on, the inclusion of a target frame for industrialized nations is being debated after all. However, his stated goal of deciding on a [[w:roadmap|roadmap]] for negotiations, which he said needed to address the matter of [[W:Greenhouse Gas|Greenhouse Gas]] (GHG) emissions reductions after 2012, and would have to be concluded by 2009, is not yet achieved, there being disagreement on a matter of points.

[[w:China|China]] for example restated a position it had made at the beginning of the first week, calling for 2010 as target year for the so called "Bali Roadmap". <!--(I know this is seen as totally unviable by a number of observers[which would give this fact some context], but I'm afraid I have difficulties sourcing it...).-->

But a bigger point of contention is that the EU and the vast majority of the 190 nations participating in the conference want to set a target of a 25-40% cut in GHG emissions. The U.S., along with Canada and Japan, are refusing to agree to any targets at this point.

The EU and others say it is important to set targets now, to get a head start in the fight against global warming. The U.S. says targets should come later, after negotiations begin.

The latest to be heard by Sean Heron, who is reporting on behalf of the Wikinews on site, regarding the ongoing negotiations was a statement by a Pakistani official, saying that the US had made a new proposal, and that he was feeling more optimistic than he had the day before. The official spoke in the press conference room, excusing the Ambassador Munir Akram, who was supposed to give a briefing on behalf of the [[w:Group of 77 and China|Group of 77 and China]], but couldn't make it, as negotiations, due also to the new American suggestion, were still ongoing at 11 pm local time.

EU may see no reason to go to next major emitters meeting
{{date|December 13, 2007}}

[[w:Stavros Dimas|Stavros Dimas]] at a press conference today stated that the [[Europe|European Union]] would not view it as necessary to attend the [[w:major emitters meeting|major emitters meeting]] (MEM) if no substantial agreement was reached at the [[w:2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|climate change conference]] in [[Indonesia|Bali]]. His statement was made after being asked about rumours of the EU boycotting the [[United States|US]] held MEM. He said that he had mentioned the preceding point of view in the presence of an under-secretary of the US government at a business breakfast this morning. He answered to a later question that he felt disappointed at the current stance of the US government, and wished clarity for the moment.

According to a press release by [[w:Greenpeace|Greenpeace]], the [[Germany|German]] environmental minister [[w:Sigmar Gabriel|Sigmar Gabriel]] also declared to the press that the EU would not be taking part in the scheduled MEM in January if substantial progress was not made. Amongst other points that are currently being discussed, one which is often referred to is that of whether or not a guideline frame for emissions reductions is to be included in the preamble of one of the final documents. The proposed frame is 25-40% cuts in [[w:GHG|greenhouse gas]] emissions for industrialized nations (known as Annex I nations in UNFCCC parlance), from 1990 baselines. The US is amongst the relatively small number of nations, including Canada and Japan, that are opposed to this.

Asked what he knew of the matter at an earlier press conference, [[w:Yvo de Boer|Yvo de Boer]] of the [[w:UNFCCC|UNFCCC]] stated that Stavros Dimas, the [[w:European Commissioner for the Environment|European Commissioner for the Environment]], had voiced his opinion that if no agreement is reached now, than there would be no need for the Major Emitting nations meeting to be held, because, so he apparently stated, the MEM is meant to feed into the UN process, and you could not feed something into nothing.

The talks being held in Bali are expected to lead to a roadmap for negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions caps for after 2012, which is when the current first phase of the [[w:Kyoto protocol|Kyoto protocol]] is going to run out. Multiple parties, observers, and the top [[United Nations|UN]] executive of the Climate Change branch all had expressed their hope that this roadmap would also include a target date of 2009 for the conclusion of negotiations. The major emitters meeting is a convention of those nations that have the greatest greenhouse gas emissions, and was held for the first time at the invitation of the US in Autumn this year.

Climate Conference in Bali concluded; opinions on outcome differ
{{date|December 17, 2007}}
The climate conference that was held for the last two weeks in Bali came to a conclusion on Saturday. Agreement was reached <!--[literally at the last minute POV?]--> on the so called Bali roadmap, but opinions differed on the substance of this and other documents that were decided upon.

The Roadmap establishes the target year of 2009 and the scope for a post-2012 climate change agreement. This agreement is expected<!--by who exactly, hmmm?--> to include the setting, for industrialized nations, of reduction targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, amongst other things.

While the EU <!-- and G77 & China, not sure, but I believe--> had wished for the inclusion of a guideline range of 25-40% for GHG emission cuts by industrialized nations by 2020, this had been opposed by the US and others, <!-- Canada, Japan, Australia, Saudis? I only really know the US from word of mouth as well...-->and so was not included in the final "roadmap" which addresses all nations that are part of the [[w:UNFCCC|United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention]] (UNFCCC). The range was however included in the preamble of the document agreed on by the members of the Kyoto Protocol. 

===Bali Roadmap breakdown===

The "Bali Roadmap" document can be seen as having three distinct sections: 

The first is the preamble, which is non binding and is there to put the following decisions in context. This is where the guideline emissions cut range would have been. Still included is a reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year. It also recognizes that "deep cuts in global emission will be required" to avoid dangerous climate change.

The second part is composed of a section calling for a "shared vision for long-term cooperative action, including a long-term global goal for emission reductions" and then goes on with a description of the four "building blocks" envisioned for tackling climate change. These are 
*mitigation
*adaptation
*technology development and transfer
*and financing

The third and last part is the technical part of the document, with a proposed timetable for meetings and similar procedural matters being included.

===Current matters===

But it was not just the future that was talked about. There was also consensus on a number of current <!--POV?: ly pressing--> issues, such as the setting up of an expanded adaptation fund, and the necessity of accelerating the transfer and development of "climate friendly" technology.

===Opinions===
Perspectives on the outcome varied, with some non governmental organizations (NGOs) like Greenpeace International being generally happy that an agreement was achieved, but stating that a stronger mandate for the post 2012 negotiations had been wished for, and that current issues were not all addressed satisfactorily either.

The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon on the other hand welcomed the outcome of the conference, stating that all of his three benchmarks for success had been reached. He went on to say that he "believes that the Bali Roadmap that has been agreed is a pivotal first step toward an agreement that can address the threat of climate change, the defining challenge of our time."

The EU also welcomed the agreement that was reached, with Commission President José Manuel Barroso noting that "We have worked hard to achieve this result. It is a very important step forward." Both he and Stavros Dimas, European Commissioner for Environment, made it clear that Bali had only been the start of what needed to be done, with the later stating that "Now the real hard work must begin. It is essential that the agreement to be worked out over the next two years is ambitious enough to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels.”

Nepalese monarchy to become republic
{{date|December 24, 2007}}
{{Nepal}}
[[Image:Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev.png|thumb|left|180px|A sketch of King Gyanendra of Nepal.{{Image source|[[w:it:Utente:Duvilar|Duvilar]]}}]]
The principal political parties of [[Nepal]] have decided to abolish the {{w|constitutional monarchy}}, headed by King {{w|Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra}}, and turn the country into a republic. The insurgent {{w|Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Maoists}} would be allowed to return to the government.

The Maoists, a military group who want a socialist republic, left the government in September demanding the end of the monarchy. They had only joined since the peace agreement at the end of the 1996-2006 {{w|Nepalese Civil War}}. An agreement has now been reached after they signed a 23-point pact with the 6 main Nepalese political parties. 

The treaty establishes that a {{w|Nepalese Constituent Assembly|constitutional assembly}} should form in April to rewrite the {{w|Constitution of Nepal|constitution}}, formally end the monarchy and put together the details of the new republican system. The Maoist rebels declared a cease fire and signed a peace treaty, agreeing to place its troops and weapons under [[United Nations]] supervision.

Extremist group claims responsibility for killing of American diplomat in Sudan
{{date|January 5, 2008}}
{{Sudan}}A previously unknown militant group has claimed responsibility for killing a [[United States]] diplomat in the [[Sudan]]ese capital of [[w:Khartoum|Khartoum]] on New Year's Day. 

The group, calling itself Ansar al-Tawhid (Companions of Monotheism), said its members shot 33-year-old [[w:John Granville|John Granville]] and his Sudanese driver Abdel Rahman Abbas. The name of the militant group has been used by many other groups of extremists in other areas of the world.

It was not immediately possible to authenticate the claim, which was posted on a Web site used by Islamists. 

Granville was being driven home on New Year's Day when another vehicle cut his car off, and assailants opened fire. 

[[w:FBI|FBI]] agents and other U.S. investigators have traveled to Sudan to investigate the shooting. 

Sudan's foreign ministry has said the shooting was an isolated incident with no political connotations. Sudanese media reports quoted a government official earlier this week as saying there is no evidence the attack was an act of terrorism.

U.S.-Sudanese relations have been tense because of the violence in Sudan's Darfur region. The shooting happened one day after a joint [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]-[[w:African Union|African Union]] force took over peacekeeping duties in Darfur.

Opposition calls for mass rallies across Kenya
{{Kenya}}
{{date|January 11, 2008}}
[[Image:Mwai Kibaki-2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Kenya]]'s President [[Mwai Kibaki]]]]
[[Kenya]]'s political opposition says mediation efforts with the government over Kenya's flawed December elections have collapsed and the opposition is now calling for mass rallies across the country next week. 

Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Secretary-General {{w|Anyang Nyongo}} called for Kenyans in towns around Kenya to gather for three days of protests next week, in a move that it hopes will mimic the Ukrainian revolution that led to the overturning of flawed election results.

Just minutes after the plan was announced, Kenya's police commissioner said the rallies would not be allowed.

Leaders of the opposition laid blame for the country's political deadlock in the lap of President [[Mwai Kibaki]]'s government which says the opposition should bring its complaints to court.  Opposition leaders says that the vote count, which has been surrounded by allegations of rigging, was a violation of the constitution and that the courts are in Mr. Kibaki's pocket.

Flanked by opposition presidential candidate {{w|Raila Odinga}} and ODM lawmakers who won parliamentary seats, Nyongo called the vote-rigging and the government's stance a betrayal of the rights of all Kenyans.

"The Kibaki side does not want a just solution," he said.  "It is hell-bent on clinging to power regardless of the verdict of the people of Kenya. The Kibaki side wants only to dictate terms that we should follow. There are no compromises and no second thoughts about what they have done. Talks are just an opportunity for them to delay and silence us, while they consolidate themselves in power."

At least 500 people have been killed and more than 250,000 displaced in violence that erupted since Kenya's vote, and neither side has shown any willingness to compromise.  On Thursday, [[Ghana]] President {{w|John Kufuor}} left Kenya after failing to achieve a deal between the two sides.
{{missing image|Image:2007 and 2008 Violence in Kenya.jpg|thumb|left|Previous violence in Kenya}}
President Kibaki has named several members of his new Cabinet despite the controversy over the vote, which international observers say appears to have been rigged. Almost all of those appointed are political allies, a fact that the opposition has said is proof of his unwillingness to compromise.

The government says it is committed to constructive dialogue, but opposition leader Nyongo says that is a sham.

"Stealing is still going on, cheating is still going on, and quite honestly, Kibaki should be embarrassed to be, embarrassed every day by the fact that he stole," he added.  "I don't think it's a very good sign to be a head of state who has the extra title of eminent thief."

Meanwhile on Thursday, former [[United Nations]] Secretary-General {{w|Kofi Annan}} was to arrive with several prominent African leaders to try to broker a compromise. Mr. Odinga's team has said it only wants talks to take place through a mediator, while President Kibaki has insisted on face-to-face negotiations.

UK and Aussie troops will not fight opium in Afghanistan
{{date|February 23, 2006}}
[[Image:8651819 d63dee249d o.jpg|right|200px|thumb|raw opium seized in Afghanistan]]

Colonel Gordon Messenger, commander of the [[United Kingdom|British]] forces in Southern [[Afghanistan]], has said that troops under his command will not be engaged in the fight against {{w|opium}} cultivation. "There will be absolutely no maroon berets [of the marines] with scythes in a poppy field," he said.

The [[United Nations]] has reported that a "fear that Afghanistan might degenerate into a narco-state is slowly becoming a reality." 

[[United States|U.S.]] State department officials and the {{w|Central Inteligence Agency|CIA}} claim that Afghan drug trafficking is a primary source of funding for terrorists. Doug Wankel, a former Drug Enforcement Administration official who is point man for the U.S. counternarcotics initiative at the American Embassy in {{w|Kabul}}, said the opium industry is "financing terrorism. It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism. ... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."

[[Australia]] recently committed 200 extra troops to Afghanistan. {{w|Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister}} [[John Howard]] has said that they also will not be involved in destroying opium poppies. "Well, dealing with that is overwhelmingly the responsibility of the local authorities," he said. 

[[Image:Papaversomniferum.jpg|left|200px|thumb|opium poppy]]

A 2005 U.S. State department report warned that Afghanistan is becoming a "narcotics state". Afghan hectares in opium cultivation has increased by 50% since the coalition invasion; up from an average of 67,000 prior to the invasion (1998-2001), to an average of 97,000 since the invasion (2002-2005). The last year under the [[Taliban]], 2001, saw production of 185 metric tonnes; in 2005 production was 4,100 metric tonnes.

Afghanistan produced 87% of the world's opium in 2005 with 104,000 hectares in production.  [[Hamid Karzai|President Karzai]] has blamed the coalition for this situation, "This particular operation (controlling opium production) was supposed to be done by an agency, a department that was funded by the international community, by the United States, by Britain. The failure is theirs, not ours." Karzai said. "Where international money and creation of forces for destruction of poppies was concerned, it was ineffective and delayed and half-hearted." Karzai is opposed to aerial spraying which was proposed by the United States, as is done in other drug producing regions of the world, because of what Karzai called "health concerns".

Adrian Edwards of the United Nations stated 2 months ago that early reports indicate "there will be an increase in poppy cultivation in 2006".

UN appeals for US$42 million to assist victims of Kenya violence
{{date|January 17, 2008}} 

{{kenya}}The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] has launched an appeal for US$42 million to assist victims of post-election violence in [[Kenya]]. 

U.N. Chief of Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief, John Holmes, says the funds are urgently needed to provide humanitarian and early-recovery assistance over the next six months to approximately 500,000 people who have been affected by the violence that erupted in late December. The United Nations estimates that about half those affected have been internally displaced.

About two dozen donor countries from [[Europe]] and elsewhere have been asked to help. The money will go to support 63 U.N. and non-governmental organizations who intend to deliver food aid, protection, shelter, water and sanitation and disease outbreak prevention. The largest amount of the appeal - ten million dollars - is intended to be allocated to food aid. 

The European Union has said it may temporarily stop giving aid to Kenya unless the issues surrounding the election are resolved.

Holmes says the U.N. hopes the situation in Kenya normalizes soon.

"What we want is a return to normality, a political solution as soon as possible, and also as I said last week, every effort to be made by all the leaders concerned - political, religious, whoever they may be - to prevent violence, to extend protection to civilians of all kinds, and to stop any kind of downward spiral of ethnic or other violence which may be very difficult to reverse once its stopped," said John Holmes.

Many parts of Kenya have seen violence following the announcement of the December 27 presidential election results. More than 600 people are believed to have been killed in post-election violence, a quarter of a million have been driven from their homes and another 6,000 have fled to neighboring [[Uganda]].

At least 45 killed in new wave of violence in Kenya
{{Kenya}}
{{date|January 27, 2008}} 

At least 45 people have been killed in a new surge of violence that began after [[Kenya]]'s disputed December 27 presidential election. Some sources have said that there have been over 80 deaths in the last 3 days. The latest deaths come as former [[United Nations|U.N.]] secretary-general [[Kofi Annan]] is in Kenya to try to broker a compromise.

Police had imposed an overnight curfew in the city of {{w|Nakuru}}, about two hours north of [[Nairobi]], after new violence broke out on Friday. The killings appear to be ethnically motivated, as Kikuyus seek revenge for attacks against their fellow tribesmen in recent weeks.

Officials estimate that nearly 800 people have been killed since the vote, which saw President [[Mwai Kibaki]], a Kikuyu, defeat opposition candidate [[Raila Odinga]] by just 230,000 votes.  Odinga supporters from the Luo, Kalenjin and other smaller ethnic groups claim the election was stolen, and international observers say the vote was flawed.

Widespread anger at the election results sparked violence in Nairobi's slums and parts of the west, and tens of thousands of Kikuyus fled their homes.  The violence had largely died down in recent days, but has erupted again in Nakuru.

Police also said Saturday that at least 15 people have been killed in the town of Molo, west of Nakuru. The two towns are in the Rift Valley, an ethnically mixed area that has seen violence in the past over land and resources.

{{QuoteLeft|The Kalenjins had already pushed and got the Kikuyus earlier so what they are doing is the Kikuyus are trying to revenge and get back their places, get back their houses|4=Jimmy Mucheru, resident of Nakuru}}
"The Kalenjins had already pushed and got the Kikuyus earlier so what they are doing is the Kikuyus are trying to revenge and get back their places, get back their houses," said Jimmy Mucheru, who is a local safari guide in Nakuru.  "There is not much hope for peace because the two groups are really after each other."

The new wave of violence came as former U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan was in Kenya trying to resolve the crisis. In a news conference on Saturday, he urged followers of the two leaders to remain calm. He said he saw several camps for people who have been displaced by the crisis.


{{QuoteRight|What we saw was rather tragic|4=Former UN secretary general, Kofi Annan}}
"What we saw was rather tragic," he noted.  "We visited several IDP camps, we saw people pushed from their homes, from their farms, grandmothers, children, families uprooted. And I think it is important that all Kenyans respond with sympathy and understanding and not try to [seek] revenge."

On Thursday, Mr. Annan managed to secure the first face-to-face meeting between Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga, a move hailed as a breakthrough. But the two sides have shown no willingness to negotiate issues of substance. Mr. Kibaki insists he is the legitimate president of Kenya, while Mr. Odinga is demanding a new vote.

Mr. Annan urged people to give more time to Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga to work out a solution.

"No one should take the law into his or her own hands," he added.  "Allow the leaders the opportunity to resolve these issues - and as I said - including the long-term issues. And we are here to help them, that was the purpose and objective of that meeting."

Mr. Annan told reporters it is unacceptable that no one has been held accountable for the violence, though he did not apportion blame.

Earlier this week, the New York-based Human Rights Watch reported what it said was evidence that the opposition had organized some attacks. Mr. Odinga's team has denied those claims.

Chad military clashes with rebels in N'djamena
{{date|February 1, 2008}} {{Chad}} 

Violence between Rebels and the Chadian military started in [[Chad]] as rebel groups are continuing to advance on the [[w:N'djamena|N'djamena]], the capital of Chad. [[w:IRIN|IRIN]] has reported that the government of Chad responded to the move by the rebel groups by placing tanks across N'djamena. 

The chief of the Chadian military has said that the battle has ended with the rebels being "entirely destroyed this column after 40 minutes of fighting," a claim which has been denied by the rebel groups. Timan Edrimi, one of the leaders made an opposing claim  by saying that "The army attacked us [the rebels] 40 kilometres from Massaguet, but we drove them back" 

The [[w:United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) has said in a press release that "a series of armed attacks on the UN refugee agency and other aid organisations has forced UNHCR to evacuate most of its staff from its office in Guereda in eastern Chad." A representative for the organisation said "We [the UNHCR] are left only with one choice, much to our regret, which is to relocate most staff out of Guereda area, as we cannot continue to perform our activities in favor of refugees."

According to [[w:Agence France-Presse|AFP]], the [[w:European Union force|European Union force]] (EUFOR) has suspended all flights to Chad, although it was made clear that this was only a temporary delay. The commander of EUFOR in Chad said he did not consider a danger to EUFOR and he said that he would not consider it a danger "unless during their offensive they threaten or attack civilians, or the non-governmental organisations, or UN personnel."

UN Secretary-General expresses concern about crises in Chad, Kenya, Sudan
{{date|February 7, 2008}}
[[Image:Bankimoon07052007.jpg|thumb|200px|Ban Ki-moon, U.N. Secretary-General]]

[[w:United Nations Secretary-General|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[w:Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]] has expressed concern about crises in [[w:Chad|Chad]], [[w:Kenya|Kenya]], and the [[w:Sudan|Sudan]]. The U.N. chief is recently back from Africa where he attended the [[w:African Union|African Union]] summit in [[w:Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] and met with leaders in Kenya.

On rebel efforts to overthrow the government in Chad in recent days, the secretary-general welcomed an African Union initiative to have the leaders of [[w:Libya|Libya]] and the [[w:Democratic Republic of Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] mediate the crisis. He says the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] will do its utmost to help resolve the crisis, urging the [[w:Security Council|Security Council]] to act swiftly to help bring an end to the violence.

"It has devastating consequences not only for the people of Chad and Darfurian refugees seeking shelter there, but also for Darfur itself," said Ban.

Mr. Ban told reporters the situation in the neighboring [[w:Darfur|Darfur]] region of Sudan is no less troubling. He says the deployment of the AU-U.N. peacekeeping force, known as [[w:UNAMID|UNAMID]], must be sped up and urged member states to properly equip the troops.

"UNAMID still lacks required aviation and ground transportation - chiefly helicopters. Additional troops will not make up for this shortfall," said Ban. "Those countries that called for intervention in Darfur are under special obligation to deliver on their promises."

While at the AU summit, Mr. Ban says he discussed some of the outstanding issues affecting the deployment with Sudanese President [[w:Omar al-Bashir|Omar al-Bashir]], and he expects the [[w:Status of Forces Agreement|Status of Forces Agreement]] (SOFA) to be signed this week. But Mr. Ban remained vague on whether some of the agreement's sticking points - such as night flights, land agreements, and advance notice of U.N. movements - had been settled.

On Kenya, Mr. Ban says he has been deeply engaged in the post-election crisis and told political leaders during his visit there that they bear particular responsibility for the future of Kenya.

"I stressed to all the Kenyan leaders the need to stop the unacceptable violence and killings, and to resolve their differences through dialogue and democratic process. I also appealed to all the political leaders to think beyond their individual interests or party lines and to look to the future of Kenya as one country," he said.

Mr. Ban also met in [[w:Nairobi|Nairobi]] with his U.N. predecessor, [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]], who is leading the panel of eminent Africans trying to mediate the crisis, and said they discussed his roadmap for the talks.

Security of U.N. personnel in Africa and elsewhere has been high on the secretary-general's agenda, especially in the wake of the [[w:December 11, 2007 Algiers bombings|December bombing]] in [[w:Algeria|Algeria]] that killed 17 staff members. Mr. Ban announced that he is naming diplomat [[w:Lakhdar Brahimi|Lakhdar Brahimi]] to chair an independent panel on safety and security of U.N. personnel and premises. Brahimi is an Algerian, but Mr. Ban says he has no concerns about his fairness or objectivity in heading up the panel.

Kosovo seeks recognition as independent state
{{date|February 18, 2008}}
[[Image:Kosovo Independence Celebration Car with Flags.jpg|thumb|In [[Switzerland]], Kosovars celebrated with Albanian, Swiss, and American flags.]]
A day after declaring independence from [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]] is hoping for recognition from the global community, especially the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]].

"We expect to be recognized by the first countries any minute," said Prime Minister [[w:Hashim Thaci|Hashim Thaci]] to his cabinet. Most of the EU's 27-member nations are expected to recognize Kosovo. The [[United States]] is prepared to recognize Kosovo as well; President [[George W. Bush]] supported their actions during his trip to [[Africa]]. In an interview broadcast live from [[Tanzania]], Bush said, "The Kosovans are now independent. It's something I've advocated along with my government."

Meanwhile, Serbia continued to oppose Kosovo, and has now taken legal action against its leaders. Serbian lawmakers rejected the proclamation as "invalid" and "illegal". The President, Prime Minister, and Speaker of Kosovo were charged with "a serious criminal act against the constitutional order and security of Serbia", according to the Interior Ministry.

Serbia will also attempt to prevent Kosovo from gaining admission into the U.N. and other international organizations, with the help of [[Russia]]. "The so-called Kosovo state will never be a member of the United Nations," said Serbian foreign minister Vuk Jeremic. "Serbia will use all diplomatic means at its disposal to block Kosovo's recognition."

Russia, which has historically been against Kosovan independence, reiterated their opposition to the act. "Our position is that this declaration should be disregarded by the international community," said Vitaly Churkin, Russia's [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] ambassador. Churkin said he worried for the safety of the Serb minority in Kosovo. "We'll strongly warn against any attempts at repressive measures should Serbs in Kosovo decide not to comply with this unilateral proclamation of independence," he said.

Several thousand ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo went to rallies to protest the declaration, where chants of "This is Serbia!" could be heard. [[w:Marko Jaksic|Marko Jaksic]], leader of the Serbian Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija, showed up at one of the rallies. "America is no longer the single world power," he said. "The Russians are coming. As long as there is Russia and Serbia, there will never be an independent Kosovo."

Protests held in the [[Bosnia]]n city of [[w:Banja Luka|Banja Luka]] were more violent. Dissenters held up signs reading "Kill the [[w:Albanians|Albanians]]!", and stones and eggs were reportedly thrown at police.

The European Union has agreed to send some 2,000 police officers and civil administrators to Kosovo to stabilize the situation and help build institutions. "I think it's very important that we recognise that all of the countries of the Western Balkans are European countries and therefore it's critical that Europe shows real leadership in how it ensures that peace and stability are the order of the day," said [[United Kingdom]] foreign secretary [[David Miliband]].

Despite the majority of European Union members that are expected to recognize Kosovo, several nations, including [[Spain]], have already rejected their claim to independence. "The government of Spain will not recognize the unilateral act proclaimed yesterday by the assembly of Kosovo," said Spanish foreign minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. Spain thinks the declaration does not respect international law, he explained.

In [[China]], Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao expressed concern over Kosovo's bid for independence. "Kosovo's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the Balkan region," he said. 

Other nations which will not recognize Kosovo include [[Sri Lanka]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]], [[Slovakia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Indonesia]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Azerbaijan]].

The [[w:United Nations Security Council|United Nations Security Council]] is scheduled to discuss the issue later today.

Kenyan government and opposition agree on power sharing
{{date|February 28, 2008}}
{{Kenya}}The heads of the government and opposition in [[Kenya]] have signed a power sharing agreement aimed at ending the crisis over December's disputed elections. The agreement was reached after a day of talks mediated by former [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] and the Chairman of the {{w|African Union}} {{w|Jakaya Kikwete}}.

Kenyan President [[Mwai Kibaki]] and opposition leader {{w|Raila Odinga}} signed the agreement before international diplomats and representatives of the Kenyan government and opposition.

Chief mediator Kofi Annan said that the two leaders had agreed on a government structure after five hours of intensive talks.

"I am pleased to be able to tell you and all the citizens of Kenya that the two parties this afternoon completed the work on agenda item three, how to overcome the political crisis," he said.

The two sides agreed to the creation of the posts of prime minister and two deputy prime ministers. The prime minister is accorded authority over the ministries. The prime minister is to be nominated by the largest party or coalition in parliament and can only be removed by a majority vote of the national assembly. The accord also calls for distribution of the ministerial posts according to the relative strength of each party in parliament. And it calls for the changes to be enacted by constitutional amendment, a major demand of the opposition. The Prime Minister post has gone to Odinga.

Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga pledged to ensure that the accord is implemented and called for unity among all Kenyans. Mr. Annan commended the two parties, saying they reached a common position for the good of the nation. And he had a message for the citizens of Kenya.

"Compromise was necessary for the survival of this country," he said. "Support this agreement, for it is the key to the unity of Kenya. It is the foundation for national reconciliation and it is the springboard for national recovery."

[[United Kingdom|British]] Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] released a statement calling the signing of the power-sharing agreement a "a triumph for peace and diplomacy."

"Kenya's leaders have reached a power-sharing agreement that represents a triumph for peace and diplomacy, and a renunciation of the violence that has scarred a country of such enormous potential. Common sense has prevailed, and the Kenyan people have the outcome for which they have hoped and prayed," the statement said.  
{{QuoteLeft|Support this agreement, for it is the key to the unity of Kenya. It is the foundation for national reconciliation and it is the springboard for national recovery.|4=Former UN secretary general, Kofi Annan}}
Brown also thanked Kofi Annan for his work and urged the international community to play their part and support Kenya's new government. Brown also noted that "Real leadership, patience and tolerance is necessary to ensure that the agreement sticks."

Kenyans are viewing the deal skeptically, such as 56-year old refugee Paul Waweru, "The deal between Raila and Kibaki will help to cool down the situation but I doubt if it will enable us to get back to our homes."

Diana Murugi, 72, lost her two sons in the violent fighting that has plagued Kenya since the end of the disputed elections at the close of last year.

"The coalition is about Kibaki, Raila and the big men, what about those of us here in the camp? How will I reconcile with people who killed my sons? It is impossible, even if Kibaki and Raila are in the same government," she said.

Parliament is to convene next week to enact the measures. Mr. Annan said the negotiations would resume Friday on long-term issues such as constitutional reform and ways to end inequalities in land and wealth distribution.

The two sides have been meeting for nearly five weeks in an effort to find a political solution to the Kenya crisis. One thousand people were killed and several hundred thousand were displaced in the violence that erupted after Mr. Kibaki was declared the winner of a presidential election that the opposition says was rigged.

Kenya negotiations resume; parliament to debate power sharing accord
{{date|February 29, 2008}}
{{Kenya}}Opposition and government negotiators in [[Kenya]] resumed talks on Friday, focusing on long-term aspects of the country's crisis. The talks received a boost after the leaders of the government and opposition reached a power sharing agreement. 

After breaking the deadlock over power sharing, negotiators for the Kenyan government and opposition began to focus on resolving what are seen as long-term solutions to Kenya's crisis, namely constitutional reform, land distribution and poverty.

The talks took on a new vitality after President [[Mwai Kibaki]] and opposition leader {{w|Raila Odinga}} [[Kenyan government and opposition agree on power sharing|signed a power sharing accord]] in the presence of chief mediator [[Kofi Annan]], Chairman of the African Union {{w|Jakaya Kikwete}} and the {{w|Nairobi}} diplomatic corps.

Mr. Kibaki said he would convene parliament next Thursday to begin debate on the constitutional amendments needed to implement the accord. The speaker of parliament, {{w|Kenneth Marende}}, said he does not anticipate any difficulties in passing the constitutional changes.

"There must be a bill prepared by the government, a bill which will then be tabled in parliament," said Marende. "After it is tabled in parliament it will then be moved in the normal manner and it will be debated and voted for."

Opposition parliament member {{w|Ababu Namwamba}} noted that the Kenyan constitution currently allows parliament to change the constitution with a two-thirds majority vote. He said this should not be difficult to muster given the broad support for the agreement.

"The main obstacle will be political brinkmanship and hardliners that may crop up," said Namwamba. "But otherwise, if every side maintains the goodwill that has been demonstrated by the two principals, then I do not foresee any difficulty in the implementation of this deal."

The agreement calls for the creation of the post of prime minister who will supervise the ministries and can only be dismissed by a majority vote in parliament. Mr. Odinga is expected to assume this post.

The accord also calls for the distribution of ministerial posts according to the relative strength of each party in parliament.

The [[African Union]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]] welcomed the agreement saying they hope it will bring peace and reconciliation to the country.

Kenyans reacted with spontaneous street celebrations in some cities, although some cautioned that similar deals in previous years ended up in failure.

One thousand people were killed and several hundred thousand were displaced by violence that erupted after Mr. Kibaki was declared the winner of a presidential election which the opposition says was rigged.

Negotiations between Athens and Skopje lead to deadlock
{{date|March 1, 2008}}
[[Image:Europe Balkans Macedonia geo.jpg|thumb|Map showing the Greek province of [[Macedonia]](white/blue) and the [[w:FYROM|Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]](red) in the [[w:Balkans|Balkans]].]]

The first part of the bi-lateral negotiations regarding the [[w:Macedonia naming dispute|naming-dispute]] between [[Greece]] and the [[w:Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia|Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]], under the [[United Nations]] mediation, ended without agreement in [[New York]]. As the U.N. mediator Matthew Nimetz stated earlier there are "substantial differences" - and therefore important disagreements - between the two governments on his proposal made on 19 February, adding that during his separate meetings with the two ambassadors Vassilakis and Dimitrov on Friday, he was listened to the two sides’ questions and views on the issue.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the [[NATO]] Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer will visit [[w:Athens|Athens]] on Monday morning and he will meet with the Greek Prime Minister [[w:Costas Karamanlis|Costas Karamanlis]] regarding the name-dispute between Greece and FYRO Macedonia. The Greek government has made clear that if there is no agreement between the two sides (over the official use of the name 'Macedonia') Athens will veto FYRO Macedonia's process in becoming a member of NATO. Yesterday, Karamanlis stated in a Parliament speech that Greece's ''"will for a mutually accepted solution is genuine. Our position ’no solution-no invitation’, is clear. If no solution is reached, then our neighbouring country’s aspiration to join NATO will not be materialized. And this because the principle of good neighbourly relations is a fundamental condition for relations among allies"''. 

Today, according to information presented in the News of the Greek TV station [[w:Mega Channel|Mega Channel]], the [[United States]] are pressing the Greek side for a quick solution in order to avoid any problems regarding the NATO invitation to Skopje. It should be noted that the government of FYRO Macedonia insists in the use of its constitutional name (Republic of Macedonia) while Greece suggests a composite name which would include a geographic term. A demonstration of nationalists was organized a few days ago in [[w:Skopje|Skopje]], while next week the [[w:right-wing|right wing]] Greek party [[w:Popular Orthodox Rally|LAOS]] organizes a rally in the city of [[w:Thessaloniki|Thessaloniki]] asking for national referendum and calling the government to use the right of veto.

United Nations condemns Palestinian rocket attacks and Israel's 'disproportionate' response
{{date|March 2, 2008}}
{{Palestine}}
[[United Nations]] Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] has deplored [[Israel]] for using excessive force in the [[w:Gaza Strip|Gaza Strip]] after troops killed 61 people Saturday including eight children, the bloodiest day for [[Palestine|Palestinians]] since the 1980s.

Addressing the [[w:United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], Ban condemned Israel's excessive use of force, but also criticised Palestinian rocket attacks. "I condemn Palestinian rocket attacks, and call for the immediate cessation of such acts of terrorism, which serve no purpose, endanger Israeli civilians, and bring misery to the Palestinian people. I call for an end to these attacks," said Ban. 

"While recognising Israel's right to defend itself, I condemn the disproportionate and excessive use of force that has killed and injured so many civilians, including children ... I call on Israel to cease such attacks," Ban continued.

However, there was no sign that the Israeli government is willing to stop an offensive that put more troops in Gaza on Sunday than since Israel ended a 35-year occupation in 2005. The offensive comes in response to a recent number of Palestinian rocket attacks including one on Wednesday which killed an Israeli student in the town of [[w:Sderot|Sderot]].

There have been calls by [[Libya]] to agree to a draft that would condemn Israel's killing of civilians; however, diplomats believe that it will not pass unless it is amended to mention Palestinian rocket fire.

UN: Military attacks on Darfur violated international law
{{date|March 20, 2008}}
[[Image:Gharb Darfur.PNG|thumb|Location of West Darfur within Sudan.]]

A [[United Nations]] report released Thursday states that recent attacks carried out on four villages in [[Darfur]] by the [[Sudan]]ese military and armed miltias were a violation of international law.

The attacks, which involved aerial bombardment in two of the villages, left a total of 115 people dead and over 30,000 forcibly displaced, according to the report. Damage to civilian property was extensive; homes, schools, and shops were systematically destroyed, vandalized, or set ablaze, food reserves were burned, and livestock was looted. In addition, there were several reports of rape in one village.

The report, issued jointly by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN African Union Mission in Darfur, describes attacks on the [[w:West Darfur|West Darfur]] villages of Saraf Jidad, Sirba, Silea and Abu Suruj in January and February. The attacks were part of a Sudanese military campaign to regain control of West Darfur's northern corridor and drive out rebel insurgents from the [[w:Justice and Equality Movement|Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM).

The damage to civilians was deemed to be a "deliberate and integral part" of the military strategy. In failing to "distinguish between civilian objects and military objectives", the UN accused the Sudanese military of violating international humanitarian law. The activities of the JEM were also denounced, as they were found to be in violation of the [[w:April 8 Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement|2004 N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement]].

In Saraf Jidad, which was attacked three times in January, 26 civilians were killed, and almost the entire population was displaced. Witnesses described the attackers as [[w:Arab|Arab]] men called [[w:Janjaweed|Janjaweed]], who have had the assistance of the Sudanese government. The men were seen riding horses and camels, and some were in military vehicles. After exchanging fire with the JEM, they entered the town, where they started torching homes and shooting at civilians. 
[[Image:Darfur report - Page 4 Image 1.jpg|thumb|left|A Janjaweed mititiaman on horseback.]]
{{QuoteRight|An Antonov flew into the area and dropped three bombs ... I saw many houses set ablaze by the bombing. People started running randomly in fear and confusion.|20px|20px|Witness to the Silea attack}}
One of the victims from Saraf Jidad, who was around 80 years old, recalled the January 24 attack. "The attackers entered my house," he said. "They were four, in military uniforms. One of them hit my head with the butt of his gun. I fell down. He told me, ‘If you do not all move from here we will burn you alive.' At that, they set my house on fire. I was inside, but managed to escape though I had my arms injured by the fire."

In the other three villages, witnesses reported seeing [[w:Antonov|Antonov]] planes and military helicopters along with the armed militiamen and Sudanese troops. In Silea, the ground offensive was preceded by three aerial bombardments in different areas of the town. Nearly the entire population of 10,600 was displaced, with some having to go across the border to [[Chad]]. 

One witness of the Silea attack reported, "An Antonov flew into the area and dropped three bombs ... I saw many houses set ablaze by the bombing. People started running randomly in fear and confusion. I witnessed SAF and Janjaweed looting houses, shops and NGO offices. They would load the stolen goods in their cars and on their camels and horses and take them away." 

The village of Abu Suruj was also bombed, but no casualties were reported from this bombing. However, over 75 percent of the town was burnt down by ground troops, and 30 people were killed.

In Sirba, the pattern of attack was similar to that of Abu Suruj. Half of the village was burned down and 45 people were killed. One victim described an encounter with an armed man: "I was holding tight my four-year-old brother; I was scared that the man was going to shoot him. Instead he left. After a few seconds the roof of the house was burning. He saw we were inside and he set the hut on fire to burn us alive. We escaped from the window and ran in different directions."

Witnesses reported acts of sexual violence being committed by the attackers in Sirba, and UN investigators believe at least 10 women were victims of rape. An eyewitness reported four girls being taken into a hut and raped at gunpoint by Sudanese soldiers.

There were also reports of air and ground attacks in Jebel Moon, where many victims had fled following the attacks, but the UN was denied access to the area.

On March 3, the UN met with a West Darfur security official to address their concerns. The official argued that the JEM had taken control of the villages and a deployment of troops was necessary to regain these areas. He also denied that the Sudanese military was involved in the Saraf Jidad attacks, stating they were done by Arab tribes who had nothing to do with the military campaign.

Economic policy makers conclude Washington meetings
{{date|April 14, 2008}}
[[Image:Robert Zoellick.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Robert Zoellick, World Bank{{Image source|[http://www.ustr.gov/Who_We_Are/Bios/Biography_of_Ambassador_Robert_B._Zoellick.html USTR]}}]]
This weekend, April 12&ndash;13, the joint Development Committee of the {{w|World Bank Group}} and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) held its annual Spring Meeting in [[Washington, D.C.]]

The Group of Seven (G7), which is comprised of the economic policy makers from the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Canada]], and [[Japan]], held its annual meeting on Friday, April 11. This meeting, which rotates locations, was also held in Washington, D.C.

The Development Committee meeting ended on Sunday, with a call from the economic leaders for assistance to the countries which been adversely affected by rising food prices. Economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in five years, while the rising costs of food and energy have not slowed.
[[Image:Dominique Strauss-Kahn - Strauss-Kahn meeting in Toulouse for the 2007 French presidential election 0032 2007-04-13 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dominique Strauss-Kahn, IMF{{Image source|[[Commons:User:Guillom|Guillaume Paumier]]}}]]
{{w|Robert Zoellick}}, the president of the World Bank, said, "We have to put our money where our mouth is. Now. So that we can put food into hungry mouths. It's as stark as that." He called for {{w|United States dollar|US$}}500 million in emergency funds for the [[United Nations]]'s {{w|World Food Programme}} by May 1, 2008.

"All that has been done [in the past decade] can be undone very rapidly by the crisis coming from the increase in food prices," said {{w|Dominique Strauss-Kahn}}, the managing director of the IMF.

"Children will be suffering from malnutrition, with consequences for all their lives," he said. He cited the growing use of land for {{w|biofuels}} as contributing to rising food costs. In the end growing violence and civil unrest could be a result.

Strauss-Kahn further warned that eventually it could become "not only a humanitarian question," but could also affect developed nations by leading to trade imbalances.

Specifically cited as a current example, was [[Haiti]], where just this weekend, violence escalated resulting in the death of a United Nations peacekeeper and the ousting of Prime Minister {{w|Jacques-Édouard Alexis}}.
[[Image:PaulsonHenry.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Henry Paulson, US Treasury {{Image source|[http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/images/paulsonsmallw2.jpg US Treasury]}}]]
{{w|United States Secretary of the Treasury}} {{w|Henry Paulson}} cautioned that affected countries "need to resist the temptation of price controls and consumption subsidies that are generally not effective and efficient methods of protecting vulnerable groups."

{{QuoteRight|We have to put our money where our mouth is. Now. So that we can put food into hungry mouths. It's as stark as that.|4=Robert Zoellick, World Bank president}}
Price controls and subsidies "tend to create fiscal burdens and economic distortions while often providing aid to higher-income consumers or commercial interests other than the intended beneficiaries," Paulson said.

In their Friday statement, the G7 said "there have been at times sharp fluctuations in major currencies, and we are concerned about their possible implications for economic and financial stability." This marked the first time since the February 2004 meeting in Boca Raton, [[Florida]], that the wording on foreign exchange has been altered.

The G7 presented a plan to strengthen regulation of capital markets. They urged financial firms to "fully" disclose their at-risk investments and improve capital reserves. While the G7 did not outline new monetary or fiscal policies, it did promise action "as appropriate." The timetable for the plan is 100 days.
{{QuoteRight|While action is unlikely in the short run, they are probably already considering a pre-emptive move in foreign exchange markets to slow the dollar's decline.|4=Lena Komileva, {{w|Tullett Prebon}}}}
The head of G7 Market Economics at {{w|Tullett Prebon}}, Lena Komileva, observed, "The implicit message is that the G7 is moving closer towards concerted action in the event that persistent volatility in the foreign exchange market presents new risk of systemic failure in the financial industry."

"While action is unlikely in the short run, they are probably already considering a pre-emptive move in foreign exchange markets to slow the dollar's decline," added Komileva. 

Economists at {{w|Goldman Sachs}} told their clients, "After a period where the possibility of G7 policy intervention seemed very remote, providing no counterweight to the dollar depreciation forces, we are moving towards a regime where G7 intervention is a more real possibility."

Zimbabwe's election delay could have 'serious implications', warns UN Secretary-General
{{date|April 16, 2008}}
[[Image:Bankimoon cropped.jpg|thumb|U.N. Secretary-General [[w:Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]]]]
[[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[w:Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]] remarked on the post-election situation in [[Zimbabwe]] on Wednesday, expressing concern about the failure of the election commission to release the results. He believes the delay could have "serious implications" for Zimbabwe's people.

{{QuoteLeft|Absent a transparent solution to this impasse, the situation could deteriorate further with serious implications for the people of Zimbabwe.|4=[[w:Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]]}}
At a summit in [[New York, New York|New York City]], which was attended by the [[w:UN Security Council|UN Security Council]] and [[w:African Union|African Union]] leaders, Ban said the international community is waiting for "decisive action" from the governments of southern [[Africa]]. "Absent a transparent solution to this impasse, the situation could deteriorate further with serious implications for the people of Zimbabwe," he said. "The credibility of the democratic process in Africa could be at stake here."

Ban said the UN is willing to help the [[w:Southern African Development Community|Southern African Development Community]] resolve the crisis, and added that a possible second round of elections would have to be conducted fairly and transparently, in the presence of international observers.

[[United Kingdom|British]] Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] agreed with the Secretary-General's remarks. He called on the international community to put more pressure on Zimbabwean president [[w:Robert Mugabe|Robert Mugabe]], who has been accused of rigging the election. 

"No one thinks, having seen the result at the polling stations, that President Mugabe has won this election," Brown said. "A stolen election would not be an election at all. The credibility of the democratic process depends on there being a legitimate government."

The summit was chaired by [[South Africa]]n President [[w:Thabo Mbeki|Thabo Mbeki]], who insisted on Saturday that there was "no crisis" in Zimbabwe. [[w:Jacob Zuma|Jacob Zuma]], leader of [[South Africa]]'s ruling [[w:African National Congress|ANC]] party, disagreed with Mbeki, saying that "the situation is more worrying now given the reported violence that has erupted."

Pope addresses UN in NY as US visit continues
{{date|April 19, 2008}}
[[Image:BentoXVI-30-10052007.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Benedict XVI]]
[[Benedict XVI]] arrived in [[New York]] Friday, as part of his [[w:List of journeys of Pope Benedict XVI#United States (April 15 to April 20, 2008)|visit]] to the [[United States]]. The first part of his visit was spent in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He arrived on "Shepherd One", a specially dedicated plane belonging to [[w:Alitalia|Alitalia]], the [[w:flag carrier|flag carrier]] of [[Italy]].

On the first day of his visit to [[New York, New York|New York City]], he went to the [[United Nations]] (UN) and addressed the [[w:United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]. In his speech he urged leaders to solve world crises together, though the world still remains subject to "the decisions of a few," whom he did not name. Benedict XVI is the third [[w:Pope|Pope]] to address the United Nations in person.

The primary focus of his speech was about dialogue, diplomacy and human rights. He delivered the speech in both [[w:French language|French]] and [[w:English language|English]]. Benedict XVI said it was the duty of every nation to guarantee [[human rights]].

"If states are unable to guarantee such protection, it is then up to the international community to intervene with the legal means that are provided for under the United Nations Charter and other international instruments," the Pope said.

The Pope argued that national sovereignty should not stand in the way of protecting human rights. "On the contrary, it is indifference or non-intervention which cause the real harm," he said.

The concept of "responsibility to protect," has also been championed by [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]], in seeking international action in regions like [[Darfur]].

Benedict XVI said that religion should not be excluded at the UN because it is "a social order respectful of the dignity and rights of the person." He further added "It should never be necessary to deny God in order to enjoy one's rights. The rights associated with religion are all the more in need of protection if they are considered to clash with a prevailing secular ideology or with majority religious positions of an exclusive nature."

On Friday afternoon, after the UN address, Benedict met with members of the local [[Judaism|Jewish]] clergy at the [[w:Park East Synagogue|Park East Synagogue]], an [[w:Upper East Side|Upper East Side]] [[w:Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[w:synagogue|synagogue]] in New York City.

"The Jewish community make a valuable contribution to the life of the city," Benedict XVI told the congregation, "and I encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood."

[[w:Rabbi|Rabbi]] [[w:Arthur Schneier|Arthur Schneier]] told the Pope, that the visit was "a reaffirmation of your outreach, good will, and commitment to enhancing Jewish-Catholic relations."

Thursday, Benedict XVI held [[w:Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at [[w:Nationals Park|Nationals Park]] with an estimated 47,000 people attending. During the Mass he spoke about the [[w:Roman Catholic sex abuse cases by country#United States|sexual abuse by clergy]]. "No words of mine can describe the pain and harm inflicted by such abuse nor the damage that has occurred within the community of the church," he said. "I ask you to love your priests and affirm the good works they do."

Afterwards, Benedict XVI met privately with some of the abuse victims. Reverend Federico Lombardi, a spokeperson, said he met with five or six abuse victims for approximately 25 minutes.

One of these victims, Bernie McDaid, told [[w:Associated Press|Associated Press]] (AP) about his meeting. "I said, 'Holy Father, you need to know you have a cancer in your flock and I hope you will do something for this problem; you have to fix this,'" McDaid said. "He looked down at the floor and back at me, like, 'I know what you mean.' He took it in emotionally. We looked eye to eye."

Olan Horne, another victim who has worked with McCaid told AP, "I believe we turned the pope's head a little in the right direction."

According to a Vatican official, [[w:Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[w:Seán P. O'Malley|Seán P. O'Malley]], the [[w:Archbishop|Archbishop]] of Boston, gave the Pope a list of some 1,000 boys and girls who had been abused in the [[w:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Boston Archdiocese]] going back several decades.

"The fact that we finally got the pope to actually stand up and put a statement on record, I really think he set the bar this week," said Gary Bergeron to the ''[[w:The New York Times|The New York Times]]''. Bergeron says he was abused by a priest in [[w:Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], [[Massachusetts]].

Later on Thursday, Benedict met with religious leaders of various faiths at the [[w:Pope John Paul II Cultural Center|Pope John Paul II Cultural Center]]. He told them that, "Americans have always valued the ability to worship freely and in accordance with their conscience". He added, "children of all religions sit side-by-side, learning with one another and from one another. This diversity gives rise to new challenges that spark a deeper reflection on the core principles of a democratic society. 

"May others take heart from your experience, realising that a united society can indeed arise from a plurality of peoples, ... provided that all recognize religious liberty as a basic civil right," the pontiff said.

During the next couple of days in New York, Pope Benedict XVI is scheduled to hold Mass at [[w:Yankee Stadium|Yankee Stadium]] and visit the [[w:World Trade Center|World Trade Center site]].

Southern Sudan's defence minister among those killed in major plane crash
{{date|May 2, 2008}}
{{Sudan}}A Southern Sudan Air Connection aircraft has crashed today in {{w|Southern Sudan|Southern}} [[Sudan]], killing over a dozen people, including the area's defence minister.

[[Image:LocationSouthernSudan.svg|thumb|left|Location map of [[Africa]], {{w|Southern Sudan|Southern}} [[Sudan]] highlighted {{Image source|[[commons:User:Vardion|Vardion]], [[commons:User:Mandavi|Mandavi]]}}]]
[[Image:Air Labrador Beech 1900D.jpg|thumb|left|250px|This {{w|Air Labrador}} 1900 is comparable to the aircraft involved.]]
There are conflicting reports on how many people were on board and how many died in the Bahr Gazal crash, but at least twenty people were on board. Some sources suggest nineteen fatalities and two survivors, and others say there were 26 deaths and no survivors; it should be noted that if either of these were correct then there were more than twenty on board. Lieutenant General {{w|Dominic Dim Deng}}, the area's defence minister, is confirmed to be dead and it is thought at least 19 military officials are now deceased.

"The plane had been rented from a charter company and was carrying a delegation of leaders from the (former rebel) {{w|Sudan People's Liberation Movement}} from {{w|Wau, Sudan|Wau}} to the capital [[Juba, Sudan|Juba]]," said Luka Mariak, spokesman for the Souther Sudan president {{w|Salva Kiir}}. This makes the journey around 450 kilometres (290 miles), with the plane crashing in a flat region 375 kilometres (around 220 miles) from Juba. It is reported it subsequently caught fire.

The [[United Nations]] said that the {{w|United Nations Mission in Sudan}} (UNMIS) had dispatched a helicopter to assist the emergency response effort. The UN also said that the aircraft was a {{w|Beechcraft 1900}} and that they would fly in government officials and aviation experts to conduct an investigation. The site has been cordoned off.

Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, UNMIS's Secretary-General's Special Representative, offered his condolences to the government on behalf of both UNMIS and th UN as a whole.

Kiir said in a press conference "Twenty-one passengers were killed and either two or three crew members. Two engines failed and there was nothing the pilot could do."

{{w|Justin Yak}} and his wife are also confirmed to be dead. Yak was the minister for cabinet affairs until a 2007 reshuffle left him removed from office. He was an adviser to the president at the time of his death. Bodies were flown into {{w|Juba Airport}} were relatives waited for hours for news. UNMIS is expected to fly the bodies on to their nearby airfield, to which there is no public access.

The disaster is thought to be an accident caused by mechanical trouble. The pilot had contacted {{w|Air Traffic Control}} (ATC) to report engine problems and requested permission to conduct an emergency landing at nearby {{w|Rumbek}}. ATC lost contact minutes later.

Death toll from cyclone in Myanmar continues to rise
{{date|May 6, 2008}}
{{Myanmar}}In a radio broadcast, government officials in [[Myanmar]] say that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from [[w:Cyclone Nargis|Cyclone Nargis]] which struck the nation on May 2-3.

As rescue workers reach the most hard hit areas of the storm, they only began to realize the damage it caused. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, [[w:Bogale Township|Bogalay]] in the [[w:Pyapon District|Pyapon District]] of Myanmar.

Hundreds of thousands are homeless and another three thousand have been injured by the storm. Drinking water is contaminated and food is becoming scarce as the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] (U.N.) and other organizations try to get supplies to the region.

"The U.N. will begin preparing assistance now to be delivered and transported to Myanmar as quickly as possible," said Paul Risley, a [[w:World Food Program|World Food Program]] (WFP) spokesman.
{{QuoteLeft|Food is not an emergency priority. Water and shelter are.|4=Richard Horsey, U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid}}
Aid began to arrive in Myanmar on Tuesday, where more than 40,000 are still listed as missing. However, the delta-region of the [[w:Ayeyarwady River|Ayeyarwady River]] remains cut off from the rest of the world.

Caryl Stern, head of the [[w:United Nations Children's Fund|United Nations Children's Fund]], said "Our biggest fear is that the aftermath could be more lethal than the storm itself."

[[George W. Bush]] called on the government of Myanmar to allow the [[United States]] to provide disaster assistance. The [[w:United States Navy|United States Navy]] reportedly has three ship in the [[w:Gulf of Thailand|Gulf of Thailand]] which are within a short distance of the area. The country has had strained [[w:Foreign relations of Burma#European Union and the United States|relations]] with both the United States and the [[European Union]].

Richard Horsey, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid, said "The biggest problem will be to reach the affected areas. There will be a huge logistical problem."

Helicopters and boats would be needed to reach many areas. Horsey said, "The big concern is waterborne diseases. So that's why it's crucial to get safe water in. Then mosquito nets, cooking kits and clothing in the next few days." 

"Food is not an emergency priority. Water and shelter are," Horsey added.

UN Secretary General releases new statement as UN aid starts to reach Myanmar
{{date|May 8, 2008}}
{{Cyclone Nargis}}Aid from the [[United Nations]] has started to reach [[Myanmar]] after a recent cyclone in the region killed tens of thousands. 

The UN Secretary General, [[Ban Ki-moon]] released a statement regarding the delivery of aid to Myanmar:

{{cquote|The Secretary-General is very concerned about the continuing tragedy in Myanmar, where the Government has confirmed that over 22,000 people have died and more than 41,000 people are missing following Cyclone Nargis on 2-3 May.

Only once rescue workers reached the hardest hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the extent of damage that had occurred. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the [[w:Pyapon District|Pyapon District]] of the country.

The United Nations has reported that one million people are homeless, or in need of help in some other way.

Myanmar criticised for hampering aid; UN resumes relief efforts
{{date|May 9, 2008}}
{{Cyclone Nargis}}The [[United Nations]] (UN) is sharply criticising the government of [[Myanmar]] for impounding two airplane loads of food aid under the [[w:World Food Programme|World Food Programme]] (WFP) and preventing aid workers from entering the country, calling the action "unprecedented."

Paul Risley, a spokesperson for WFP, said that "the food aid and equipment that we managed to get in has been confiscated." The WFP has no choice but to suspend aid, he said. The WFP did, however, announce later today that it would resume aid flights.

"Three flights were scheduled for Saturday but now we have no choice but to suspend food aid until the food in the warehouse is released for WFP to distribute it," Risley told the BBC. 

"I emphatically urge the government to live up to the responsibility it has for its people and quickly allow international aid into the entire disaster area," said [[Germany|German]] chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] in an e-mail statement. "Very many people are now dependent on fast aid."

"Myanmar should be more responsive to international assistance but we cannot force Myanmar to do it, we have to respect her own decision," said Noppadon Pattma, the foreign minister of [[Thailand]]. "But the Myanmar people should be at the centre of considerations."

"I call once again upon Myanmar's authorities to lift all restrictions preventing the free dispatch of aid by the most efficient channels," said the [[France|French]] foreign minister [[w:Bernard Kouchner|Bernard Kouchner]] said in a statement. "The specialized agencies of the United Nations and NGOs must have immediate access to the victims."

Ky Luu, the director of the [[United States]]' [[w:Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance|Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance]] said, "We urge the regime of Burma [Myanmar] to open up access to all humanitarian actors," at a press conference yesterday.

"The delta region is known as the country's granary and the cyclone has hit before the harvest. If the harvest has been destroyed this will have a devastating impact on food security in Myanmar," said the aid group [[w:Action Against Hunger|Action Against Hunger]]. 

Friday afternoon, [[w:United States National Security Council|US National Security Council]] spokesperson [[w:Gordon Johndroe|Gordon Johndroe]], announced that the US had been given permission to fly in a [[w:C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]] with aid.

"We hope that this is the beginning of a long line of assistance from the United States to Burma," Johndroe told the press. "One flight is much better than no flights," Johndroe said. "They're going to need our help for a long time."

Official Myanmar death toll increases to 78,000
{{date|May 16, 2008}}
{{Cyclone Nargis}}State run television in [[Myanmar]] has reported that the death toll from the recent cyclone has increased dramatically to 77,738. In addition to this, 55,917 people are still officially missing.

In what are admittedly rough estimates, the [[United Nations]] (UN) estimates that more than 100,000 have died, while the [[w:International Committee of the Red Cross|International Red Cross]] projects 128,000 deaths. At least 10,000 people died just in [[w:Bogale Township|Bogale Township]] in the [[w:Pyapon District|Pyapon District]] of the country.
[[Image:Myanmar Disaster Topography.png|thumb|left|200px|{{Image source|[[w:User:Dragons flight|Robert A. Rohde]]}}]]
The United Nations has reported that 2.5 million people are homeless, or in need of help in the [[w:Irrawaddy Delta|Irrawaddy Delta]].

The military junta that governs the country says that it can handle relief operations and that they are going well. It is still turning down international offers to transport aid directly to the affected areas. According to state television, Prime Minister [[w:Thein Sein|Thein Sein]] said, "We have already finished our first phase of emergency relief. We are going onto the second phase, the rebuilding stage."

"Time is life," said [[w:Louis Michel|Louis Michel]], the [[w:European Commissioner for Development & Humanitarian Aid|European Commissioner for Development & Humanitarian Aid]] to reporters at [[w:Suvarnabhumi Airport|Bangkok International Airport]] in [[Thailand]]. "No government in the world can tackle such a problem alone. This is a major catastrophe."

Michel was returning from a trip to [[w:Yangon|Yangon]] where he was unsuccessful at urging the junta to allow direct aid despite its pride and paranoia about the outside world.

Aid groups, including UN agencies, say only a fraction of the required relief is getting through and, unless the situation improves, thousands more lives are at risk.

According to ''The New York Times'', the [[United States]] and some [[Europe]]an allies had considered a [[w:United Nations Security Council|United Nations Security Council]] resolution calling for "humanitarian intervention" in Myanmar, which would give authorization for a relief mission without approval of the military authorities in Myanmar. The idea was dismissed after it became clear that [[China]] would veto any such resolution. 

The US has a assembled number of ships, helicopters, transport airplanes and marines in the region, ready to assist in cyclone relief if given approval by the government of Myanmar. US officials say that helicopters can bring in assistance to areas inland from the coast and further help distribute supplies across the country. Myanmar has approved fewer than 20 cargo planes to bring supplies to the capital, Yangon.
[[Image:Bankimoon07052007.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Than Shwe has twice refused to converse with Ban Ki-moon, pictured here in 2007.{{Image source|[[w:Agência Brasil|Agência Brasil]]}}]]
At the [[w:United Nations Headquarters|United Nations Headquarters]], a row occurred when Myanmar's ambassador to the UN, Kyaw Tint Swe, interrupted the French ambassador Jean-Maurice Ripert during a speech to the [[w:United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]. He accused [[France]] of sending a [[w:warship|warship]] to Myanmar.

"It's not true," Ripert said. While the ship is operated by the [[w:French Navy|French Navy]], it is not a warship but a ship carrying 1500 tonnes of food and medicine, Ripert insisted. It also has small boats to reach the flooded Irrawaddy Delta. The ship will reach the coast of Myanmar on Saturday, awaiting approval to deliver aid.

Meanwhile, the UN is sending [[w:John Holmes (British diplomat)|John Holmes]], the [[w:Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator|Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator]], to make contact with Myanmar's reclusive military leaders to improve UN access to the hardest-hit areas.

According to UN spokesperson, [[w:Michèle Montas|Michèle Montas]], Holmes will arrive in Myanmar on Sunday. He will be carrying a letter from [[w:Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] to Senior General [[w:Than Shwe|Than Shwe]], who has twice previously refused to converse with Ban.

China kills suspected terrorists, prevents 'air disaster'
{{date|March 9, 2008}}
[[Image:National museum of China 2008 countdown clock.jpg|thumb|At the [[w:National Musuem of China|National Musuem of China]] in [[w:Tiananmen Square|Tiananmen Square]], a clock counts down the time until the 2008 Olympics begin.]]
In two separate cases, [[China|Chinese]] police have captured and killed suspected terrorists apparently targeting the [[w:2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]], and an airplane crew thwarted what appeared to be a planned hijacking, top officials said at a parliament session Sunday. 

The suspect terrorist gang was found on January 27 in [[w:Urumqi|Urumqi]], capital of the [[w:Xinjiang|Xinjiang]] region in northwest China. Two were killed and fifteen others were arrested. Police seized axes, knives, grenades, and "books about terrorism". 

"Obviously, the gang had planned an attack targeting the Olympics," said Wang Lequan, Xinjiang's [[w:Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] chief. "The Olympic Games slated for this August is a big event, but there are always a few people who conspire to commit sabotage. It is no longer a secret now."

The gang was said to have collaborated with the [[w:East Turkestan Islamic Movement|East Turkestan Islamic Movement]], a separatist movement labeled a terrorist organization by the [[United Nations]]. "Those terrorists, saboteurs and secessionists are to be battered resolutely, no matter what ethnic group they are from," said Wang. 

Xinjiang is home to a many ethnic [[w:Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups, the largest of which are the [[w:Uyghur people|Uyghur]].
Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang government and himself an Uyghur, says only a very small minority support the views of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. "They don't represent the Uighur people," he said.

In another incident, an airplane destined for [[w:Beijing|Beijing]] was forced to land early after "some people were attempting to create an air disaster," said Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang government.

The plane took off from Urumqi on Friday and landed in [[w:Lanzhou|Lanzhou]], capital of the neighboring [[w:Gansu|Gansu]] province. The flight crew stopped the alleged attackers, and all passengers and crew are reported to be safe. The plane finally arrived in Beijing Saturday morning.

"Fortunately our air crew took resolute measures, discovered and put a stop to this action promptly. All the passengers, crew and the aircraft are safe," Bekri said.

No further details were made available. The suspects are in custody, as police try to find out "who the people involved in the incident were, where they were from, what their aim was and what their background was", Bekri said. An airline official did not confirm whether the incident was a terrorist attack, saying "it's up to the police department to verify." However, Bekri believes "we can be sure that this was a case intending to create an air crash."

An anonymous source told [[w:Reuters|Reuters]] that flammable material was found in the plane's toilet, and that at least 2 passengers on the flight have been taken into custody for questioning.

Myanmar to allow foreign aid says UN's Ban Ki Moon
{{date|May 24, 2008}}
{{Cyclone Nargis}}
[[Image:Cyclone Nargis flooding before-and-after.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite photographs showing the region before and after the cyclone. {{Image source|[[w:NASA|NASA]]}}]]
After travelling in-person to [[Myanmar]], the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] (UN), [[Ban Ki-moon]], has announced that international aid-workers will be granted access to the cyclone-ravaged country.

Ban, who met with Senior General [[w:Than Shwe|Than Shwe]] — considered the head of Myanmar's [[w:military junta|military junta]] — told reporters, "I had a very good meeting with the senior general, particularly on these aid workers."

"He has agreed to allow all the aid workers, regardless of nationality. I urged him that it would be crucially important for him to allow aid workers as swiftly as possible and all these aid relief items also be delivered to the needy people as soon as possible."

International observers and aid organizations met the news with skepticism and were reported as "puzzled" and "surprised" at the announcement and expressed concerns that the offer was not genuine.

"We’ll believe it when we see the aid workers on the ground in the delta," Zoya Phan, of the Burma Campaign UK, said. "The generals have a long track record of lying to the UN. If the regime is genuine, then we’ll know within 24 hours, as they’ll take down the army checkpoints which are stopping Burmese and international aid workers getting into the delta."

"This discrepancy is a confidence gap that has to be verified, that has to be reconciled," said the [[w:Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] secretary general, [[w:Surin Pitsuwan|Surin Pitsuwan]]. "Whether the Sunday pledging conference will be successful or not depends on the ability to reconcile the difference."

The UN says that over a million people are still in dire need of food, water, shelter and medical supplies, while the official Myanmar position is that "the emergency phase of the operation is over."

"Seeing is believing," said Tom Casey of the [[United States]] Disaster Assistance Response Team to reporters in Washington. "We certainly will continue to test that by pushing for visas for our DART team, among others, and hopefully we'll see a change in behavior." 

US aid workers are still awaiting visas before they can enter Myanmar. Team leader William Berger was given a tour of the affected region along with a briefing, though he was not allowed to give his own assessment.

Monarchy abolished in Nepal
{{date|May 29, 2008}}
[[Image:Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev.png|thumb|left|An illustration of the former Nepalese king {{image credit|[[:it:Utente:Duvilar|Duvilar]]}}]]{{Nepal}}The {{w|Nepalese Constituent Assembly|Nepalese Constituent Assembly}}, elected on April 10, in [[Nepal]] recently voted to abolish its monarchy, with a large majority supporting the vote in parliament. "The Nepalese people have been freed from centuries of feudal tradition and the doors have now opened for a radical social and economic transformation," said a government spokesperson, commenting on the decision.

The former king, {{w|Gyanendra of Nepal}}, has been given two weeks to leave his palace. Authorities say that he will be forced out if he fails to leave during that period of time.

The Nepalese president, {{w|Girija Prasad Koirala}}, also commented on the move: "Today is the day when my dreams have been realized and similarly the dreams of the nation have perhaps also been realized." 

[[Ban Ki-moon]], the Secretary General of the [[United Nations]], said that by supporting the switch to a republic, the Nepalese people have "clearly spoken for peace and change."

UK study highlights child abuse by humanitarian workers
{{date|May 29, 2008}}

{{Human rights infobox}}A study by the non-profit organisation [[w:Save the Children|Save the Children]] [[United Kingdom|UK]] claims that a number of aid workers and peacekeepers from organisations such as the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] and Save the Children itself have engaged in [[w:sexual abuse|sexual abuse]] of children in the course of their humanitarian efforts. The study also says that many of these incidents remain unreported, and those involved often go unpunished.

The study was based on field data from [[Sudan]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Haiti]], where they held focus groups followed by in-depth interviews. In 20 of the 38 focus groups, United Nations representatives were the main perpetrators of sexual abuse, possibly due to the larger number of peacekeepers than aid workers, but 23 organisations were identified as being involved across the three countries. 
[[Image:Bankimoon07052007.jpg|thumb|left|United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon {{image source|[[w:Agência Brasil|Agência Brasil]]}}]]
While 14 and 15 year olds were the most common victims, the study found cases of abuse in children as young as 6. Most offenders were men, and most of the victims were girls. One 14-year-old boy who works in a peacekeeping camp on the Ivory Coast told the study that "[o]ften it will be between eight and 10 men who will share two or three girls".

An "overwhelming" majority of those interviewed said they would never report a case of abuse, and did not know of anyone who had reported a case, despite more than half knowing of incidents of sexual abuse, and many knowing of 10 or more. The study reported that unless this silence was dealt with, any attempts to eliminate the abuse would be "fundamentally flawed".
{{QuoteRight|"[The U.N.] will very carefully investigate and whenever there is necessary matters we will take necessary measures from this".|4=United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]]}}
In response to the study, United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] said that the organisation's policy on such abuse was "zero tolerance." The U.N. "will very carefully investigate and whenever there is necessary matters we will take necessary measures from this". Both Save the Children and the U.N. have pointed out that, while it does not reduce the seriousness of the offences, the offenders represent a small proportion of all peacekeepers and aid workers in foreign countries. As the U.N. does not have any prosecutory powers of its own, peacekeepers found to be involved in child sexual abuse are either fired or sent back to their home countries to face prosecution.

UN emphasizes importance of women's health in Africa
{{date|May 31, 2008}}

{{Infobox Health}}The [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] (UNFPA) organization [[w:United Nations Population Fund|United Nations Population Fund]] emphasized the importance of [[w:Women's health|women's health]] in [[Africa]] at the 4th [[w:Tokyo International Conference on African Development|Tokyo International Conference on African Development]] (TICAD IV). Priorities of the conference include [[w:Economy|economic]] growth, [[w:Peace|peace]] and [[w:Democracy|democracy]] and [[w:Climate change|climate change]]. The three-day conference which ended Friday included representatives from over 80 countries.

[[Image:Fukuda meets Rice February 27, 2008 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[w:Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister of Japan]] [[w:Yasuo Fukuda|Yasuo Fukuda]] {{Image source|[[w:United States Department of State|United States Department of State]]}}]]
At the conference in [[w:Yokohama, Japan|Yokohama, Japan]], over 40 heads of State agreed on health priorities adopted at the end of the three-day summit. The theme of the conference was "Towards a vibrant Africa: A continent of hope and opportunity", and approximately 86 countries were represented, as well as international organizations. The Yokohama Action Plan prioritizes universal access to reproductive health services and an increase in the number of African women who give birth with skilled assistance.

[[Japan]]ese [[w:Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister of Japan]] [[w:Yasuo Fukuda|Yasuo Fukuda]] announced steps which would be taken by his country to further health conditions in Africa, including: increasing funding to [[w:The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]], training 100,000 African health workers, and doubling the country's bilateral development assistance to Africa by 2012. "In the future, Africa will become a powerful engine driving the growth of the world," said Mr. Fukuda at the start of the conference.

The Prime Minister said Japan would offer up to [[w:United States dollar|US$]]4 billion in loans to African countries to go towards agriculture and infrastructure. He announced the formation of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation Facility for African Investment, which will provide $2.5 billion in financial assistance.

{{QuoteRight|Reducing maternal mortality lies at the heart of implementation to achieve all the other goals.|4=[[w:Asha-Rose Migiro|Asha-Rose Migiro]]}}
United Nations Deputy Secretary-General [[w:Asha-Rose Migiro|Asha-Rose Migiro]] cited priority 5 of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - preventing women's deaths during pregnancy and childbirth as a serious challenge. "Reducing maternal mortality lies at the heart of implementation to achieve all the other goals," said Migiro.

{{QuoteLeft|...preventing women's deaths during pregnancy and childbirth - is generating the least resources and lagging the furthest behind. And African women are paying the price.|4=[[w:Thoraya Obaid|Thoraya Ahmed Obaid]]}}
UNFPA Executive Director [[w:Thoraya Obaid|Thoraya Ahmed Obaid]] told conference participants that women's health in Africa should be made a priority. "Of all the Millennium Development Goals, goal number five - preventing women's deaths during pregnancy and childbirth - is generating the least resources and lagging the furthest behind. And African women are paying the price," she said. Obaid urged world leaders "to make the health of women a political and development priority".

TICAD holds summits every five years, and is a joint program between Japan and the [[w:United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme]]. Japan will report the conference results at the [[w:G8|Group of Eight]] (G8) meeting in Tokyo in July, which will be chaired by Prime Minister Fukuda.

U.S. Navy forced to give up on Burma relief
{{date|June 5, 2008}}
{{Cyclone Nargis}}

[[Image:US-DeptOfNavy-Seal.svg|thumb|left|The seal of the US Navy]]
The [[United States]] {{w|United States Navy|Navy}} was forced to withdraw from its {{w|Cyclone Nargis}} relief efforts in [[Burma]]/Myanmar today due to the continued refusal of the ruling {{w|State Peace and Development Council}} government to allow the delivery of aid. Four U.S. naval ships were ordered to depart from the area on Thursday. After 15 failed attempts to convince the ruling military junta to allow U.S. helicopters to deliver much needed supplies to areas such as the {{w|Irrawaddy Delta}}, Admiral {{w|Timothy J. Keating}}, the head of the {{w|United States Pacific Command|U.S. Pacific Command}}, indicated that they were left with no choice but to leave.

"I am both saddened and frustrated to know that we have been in a position to help ease the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people ... but have been unable to do so because of the unrelenting positions of the Burma military junta," Keating said via his headquarters. He said that the U.S. would still be willing to offer help if the junta simply allowed them in.

The {{w|Royal Navy|British}} and {{w|French Navy|French}} navies have also been forced to withdraw due to the junta's unwillingness to allow them to provide assistance to cyclone victims. {{w|United Nations}} (UN) Secretary-General {{w|Ban Ki-moon}} had been previously assured by the ruling Burmese generals that relief workers would be allowed to help, but reports indicate this has still not happened on the ground. The UN, in its latest report on the situation, noted that Burma was faced with a "serious lack of sustained humanitarian assistance for the affected populations."

{{QuoteLeft|I am both saddened and frustrated to know that we have been in a position to help ease the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people . . . but have been unable to do so because of the unrelenting positions of the Burma military junta|4=Admiral Timothy J. Keating}}
Foreign aid agencies already in place and trying to help victims have reported that they continue to face problems in delivering large volumes of relief supplies in the affected regions. The U.S. naval ships had 22 heavy-lift helicopters that would have been ideally suited to the task. "Important heavy-lifting capability in the delta would have been a standard operating procedure for relief agencies in the response," said Paul Risley of the {{w|United Nations World Food Program}}. The UN group has been trying to get ten civilian helicopters to fill the role in the interim, but the Burmese authorities have still not allowed nine of the civilian aircraft to be used in the relief efforts.

To date, the Burmese military has allowed 106 airlifts of foreign supplies to occur, but only into {{w|Rangoon}}, the largest city in the nation. Those delivered supplies are slated to be forwarded to the areas devastated by the cyclone. However, the ruling junta has refused to allow inland flights of foreign military helicopters to deliver relief aid. The junta believes they have sufficient abilities to deliver the resources but foreign analysts believe that the group does not wish to demonstrate to the Burmese people that it needs outside help. [[w:Doctors Without Borders|Doctors Without Borders]] has said that the relief efforts to date are not enough, and that many remote areas have received no assistance.

The UN determined that Burma may need relief efforts for a year. The {{w|United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization}} has found that 495,000 acres of rice production areas have been damaged out of a total of 2.5 million acres. The areas are either still under too much water to sustain crops, or have been contaminated by seawater during Cyclone Nargis. According to Risley, the year-long importing of rice would be required as the damage was done just before the normal planting season. "This year's crop will not meet requirements," Risley said. "The losses to the production of rice are very deep. It would be typical for the WFP to provide food rations through the next harvest, which could be a year away."

Access by foreigners to Burma has been generally restricted since the cyclone. Visas and travel permission to affected areas have been limited by the government. The {{w|International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement}} reported that "the small number of visas and the short duration of travel permits for access" into the areas in need of aid "continue to impose serious constraints on the effectiveness of overall operations." The {{w|World Health Organization}} has said that, as of yet, there appears to be no "second wave" of deaths in the wake of the blocked relief efforts, which may be a sign of hope.

78,000 people were killed by the cyclone. To date, another 56,000 remain unaccounted for, according to Burma's government.

UN summit results in pledge to mitigate food crisis
{{date|June 6, 2008}}
{{United Nations}}A three-day [[United Nations]] (UN) summit, bringing together leaders from 181 countries, has wrapped up with a pledge by all attending countries to address the global food shortage crisis. Key actions cited include doubling the world's food production by 2030, providing resources for farmers in poor countries and increasing humanitarian aid in times of crisis.

Protests and violent riots have resulted in parts of the world in recent months due to increasing unaffordability, and sometimes unavailability, of food. It is estimated that 862 million people, or just over one eighth of the world's population, are malnourished.

According to UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]], up to [[w:United States dollar|US$]]20 billion will be required annually to avert crises in the most hard-hit areas. The UN [[w:Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) has put the figure closer to US$30 billion. Pledges made just at the summit amounted to more than US$5 billion, according to the UN.

Despite the largely positively-received outcome of the summit, held in [[w:Rome|Rome]], [[Italy]], there were some who felt that the proceedings could have gone better. Several non-governmental organisations ([[w:Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]) pointed to the fact that they were not invited to partake in the discussions. Food and hunger policy adviser Magda Kropiwnicka of [[w:ActionAid|ActionAid]] commented on the strength of the final pledge: "There were no quantifiable financial commitments. Apart from the existing UN Food and Agriculture Organisation funds, no money has been given to address the key problem of boosting capacity."

While most delegates agreed that [[w:biofuel|biofuels]] have been one of the causes of the food crisis, no actions were agreed upon to address this hot topic. Biofuels have been increasingly in demand in recent years, meaning that many crops that would have previously been used for food are now being used as fuel.

The impact that biofuels has goes further than simply increasing the demand of food crops. As fuel prices increase, so do the costs of fertilisers, farm vehicle use and the transport of foods. All of this adds up to a large increase in the cost of food.

Some UN officials say that biofuel use has caused up to 30% of the global food price inflation of late. The [[United States]] estimates that figure to be closer to just 3%. ''[[w:The Globe and Mail|The Globe and Mail]]'' newspaper indicates that some estimates go as high as 60%. The only consensus that could be reached on biofuels is that they provide both "challenges and opportunities", and need to be looked into further for a conclusive analysis on their impact on food production.

Other factors increasing food prices are increased consumption of meat and dairy products in developing nations like [[China]] and [[India]]. [[Argentina]] noted that subsidies granted to farmers from the US, the [[European Union]] and other Western countries have also been a major player in the increase.

Ban Ki-moon calls for Zimbabwe elections to be postponed
{{date|June 23, 2008}}
{{Zimbabwe}}[[Ban Ki-moon]], the Secretary General of the [[United Nations]], has said that the elections in [[Zimbabwe]] should be postponed due to the fact that [[w:Morgan Tsvangirai|Morgan Tsvangirai]], the leader of the [[w:Movement for Democratic Change|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC), Zimbabwe's main opposition party, has said that he will pull out of the race to become the president of Zimbabwe. 

Ban released a statement highlighting his concerns. "The Secretary-General deeply regrets that, despite the repeated appeals of the international community, the Government of Zimbabwe has failed to put in place the conditions necessary for free and fair run-off elections," he said.

"The circumstances that led to the withdrawal of opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai today from the presidential elections represents a deeply distressing development that does not bode well for the future of democracy in Zimbabwe.  The campaign of violence and intimidation that has marred this election has done a great disservice to the people of the country and must end immediately," continued the Secretary general.

He finished by saying that "the Secretary-General has discussed the situation with various leaders, including those of the African Union and the [[w:Southern African Development Community|Southern African Development Community]] (SADC).  He strongly supports the statement of the Chairman of SADC that conditions do not exist for a run-off election to be held at this time and that they should be postponed."

This move by Ban Ki-moon comes after Morgan Tsvangirai called for the international community to intervene to improve the situation in Zimbabwe.

{{date|June 24, 2008}}
{{missing image|Image:Robert Mugabe.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Mugabe}}
[[Robert Mugabe]], the current head of state in [[Zimbabwe]] has said that the scheduled elections will take place in Zimbabwe, despite the fact that there have been calls from many influential organisations, including the [[United Nations]], to cancel the elections due to the fact that the opposition candidate has pulled out.

[[w:Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]], secretary general of the United Nations yesterday called for the election to be postponed.

Two UN contract workers kidnapped in Somalia
{{date|April 2, 2008}}

{{Somalia}}Two foreign aid workers attached to a [[United Nations]] (UN) project were kidnapped in southern [[Somalia]] on Tuesday. The UN stated that the two men, one [[United Kingdom|British]] and one [[Kenya]]n, were abducted at gunpoint while conducting a survey of local rivers. The men were taken hostage on a road leading to [[w:Bu'aale|Bu'aale]], in the southern [[w:Jubbada Hoose|Lower Jubba]] region of Somalia.

[[Image:Somalia regions map Jubbada Hoose.svg|thumb|left|[[w:Jubbada Hoose|Lower Jubba]] region in [[Somalia]]. {{Image source|[[w:de:user:Sven-steffen arndt|Sven-steffen arndt]]}}]]
Briton Murray Watson was abducted along with his Kenyan colleague, Patrick Amukhuma, by six armed militiamen who ambushed their armed convoy. The abduction took place on a main road between [[w:Saakow|Saakow]] and Bu'aale.

Gunfire was exchanged between Somali bodyguards and militia members. According to ''[[w:Agence France-Presse|Agence France-Presse]]'', local elders said that the gunmen fired shots during the attack and wounded one of the hostages, and ''[[w:The Daily Telegraph|The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that witnesses said Watson was wounded in the leg. 

Local district commissioner Ibrahim Noleye spoke with ''Agence France-Presse'' about the incident: "two foreign aid workers from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) were intercepted by armed militiamen on their way to Buale ... We believe they are being held hostage".

Amos Nyaoro of Somalia Water and Land Information Management, the UN-supported agency where Watson was working, told ''The Daily Telegraph'': "We are attempting to make contact with the people who abducted our colleagues. It is unclear why this attack has taken place. We understand that Mr Watson has been hurt, but we don't know the extent of his injuries."

''[[w:Reuters|Reuters]]'' has reported that local militias were pursuing the kidnappers in an attempt to free the hostages, and local clan elders are pressing for their release. Hajir Bille, an official from the [[w:Jubaland|Juba region]] in Somalia, told the ''[[w:Associated Press|Associated Press]]'' that security forces were looking for the abductors.

{{QuoteRight|Witnesses on the ground say there was gunfire when the men were taken, but there is no information to suggest that any serious injury was sustained by either man.|4=[[United Nations]] country office for [[Somalia]]}}
A statement released by the UN country office for Somalia addressed reports that one of the men kidnapped had been wounded: "Witnesses on the ground say there was gunfire when the men were taken, but there is no information to suggest that any serious injury was sustained by either man." ''Reuters'' has reported that the hostages are being held "in or near" the town of [[w:Jilib|Jilib]]. 

UN officials in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] said that the two men worked for an [[India]]n-based group sub-contracted to do aerial survey work for the [[w:Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), a United Nations agency. The men are not themselves members of the FAO, but are employees of [[w:Genesys International Corporation|Genesys International Corporation]], an [[w:Information technology|information technology]] company in [[Bangalore]], [[India]]. 

Genesys International Corporation performs aerial surveys in Somalia which help the area population deal with flooding due to a rise in water level of the [[w:Juba River|Juba]] and [[w:Shabelle River|Shabelle]] rivers.

Western companies and organizations have paid [[w:Ransom|ransom]]s to free their employees, and kidnappings in the area have increased as a result. In recent months attacks on foreigners in Somalia have increased, but had been localized to the northern region of [[w:Puntland|Puntland]]. [[w:Médecins Sans Frontières|Médecins Sans Frontières]] withdrew its international staff from the country after three workers were killed by a bomb in February.

Attacks against Somalia's weak government and its Ethiopian military backers have increased in the last six months. Somalia's government has not been functional since civil war began in 1991, when dictator [[w:Mohamed Siad Barre|Mohamed Siad Barre]] was overthrown and rival warlords then turned on each other.

Over one million citizens in Somalia depend on foreign aid, and UN aid helps millions of Somalians each year.

Bush appoints John Bolton United States' ambassador to the United Nations
{{date|August 1, 2005}}
[[File:John R. Bolton.png|right|160px|thumb|File photo of John R. Bolton ''Source: U.S. government press release'']]
In a televised press statement at 14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. EDT) today, [[w:President of the United States|President of the United States]] [[George W. Bush]] announced that he was appointing [[w:John R. Bolton|John R. Bolton]] to the position of the [[w:U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations|United States' ambassador to the United Nations]].

Stating that Mr. Bolton had received support from "a majority of Senators", but had been "unfairly denied the up-or-down vote that he deserved" by the "delaying tactics of a few", Mr. Bush announced that the post had stood vacant for long enough during what he termed "a war", and that he was "exercising his constitutional authority" to make the appointment.

"This post is too important to leave vacant any longer, especially during a war and a vital debate about U.N. reform," Bush said during an announcement in the Roosevelt Room of the [[w:White House|White House]]. Bolton appeared with him and spoke briefly. "I am profoundly grateful and deeply humbled," Bolton said. "It will be a distinct privilege to be an advocate for America's values and interests at the U.N." 

The President can make an appointment without the approval of the Senate while the Congress is in recess, but the term of such a [[w:recess appointment|"recess appointment"]] expires at the end of the Congressional session. The next session begins January 3, 2007. 

=== Objections ===
The move comes despite a letter to the President last week saying that Mr. Bolton was "not truthful" while answering questions before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March, and should not be given a recess appointment. The New York Times reports the letter was signed by 36 senators -- 35 Democrats and one Independent. 

Some senators, including Republicans, have raised questions regarding Mr. Bolton's history of criticizing the United Nations, his treatment of subordinates, and over charges that he has tried to influence intelligence assessments to conform to his views, the Times reports. 

During confirmation hearings, Republican Senator [[w:George Voinovich|George Voinovich]] described Bolton as "the poster child of what someone in the diplomatic corps should not be." Because of Voinovich's opposition, Bolton's nomination was sent to the floor of the Senate without a recommendation.

=== Reactions ===
"At a time when we need to reassert our diplomatic power in the world, President Bush has decided to send a seriously flawed and weakened candidate to the United Nations," said Senate Democratic Leader [[w:Harry Reid|Harry Reid]] of Nevada. "The reason Bolton is being recess appointed is because the president chose to stonewall the Senate. Mr. Bolton could have had his up or down vote had President Bush given senators the information they needed. Instead, Bolton arrives at the United Nations with a cloud hanging over his head."

"The president has done a real disservice to our nation by appointing an individual who lacks the credibility to further U.S. interests at the United Nations. I will be monitoring his performance closely to ensure that he does not abuse his authority as he has in the past," said Sen. [[w:Christopher Dodd|Christopher Dodd]], D-Conn.

<!-- Please see the FOX News article to determine if I edited the following quotes too heavily. -->
"We will work with him as the ambassador and representative of the president and the government," U.N. Secretary-General [[w:Kofi Annan|Kofi Annan]] said. "We look forward to working with him, as I do with the other 190 ambassadors".

Republican Senator [[w:John Cornyn|John Cornyn]] of Texas praised the president for using his authority "to end the obstruction against John Bolton." Cornyn said, "This is an important position and it's critical that it not remain vacant any longer. Bolton is exceptionally well qualified to fill this role at this time."

UN to send troops to Darfur, Sudan
{{date|July 31, 2007}}
[[Image:Darfur map.png|right|230px|thumb|Map of Darfur, Sudan.]]
At least 26,000 [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] (UN) troops will be sent to the [[w:Darfur|Darfur]] region of [[Sudan]] in [[Africa]] under resolution 1769 in an attempt to stop violence from spreading and to protect civilians from the fighting. The force includes at least 19,555 troops and nearly 7,000 civilian police officers in a force being called the "United Nations-African Union Mission" (UNAMID). The UN [[w:United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] voted unanimously to send troops to the region.

At least 200,000 people have been killed in four years of fighting in the region and more than two million have been displaced. 

Troops will be sent to the region under Chapter 7 of the UN charter which states that the UN "shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken to maintain or restore international peace and security." 

Language authorizing the troops to seize illegal weapons caches and mentions of possible future sanctions if Sudan does not co-operate was removed during negotiations. The resolution does allow troops to monitor weapon caches. 

"If any party blocks progress and the killings continue, I and others will redouble our efforts to impose further sanctions. The plan for Darfur from now on is to achieve a cease-fire, including an end to aerial bombings of civilians; drive forward peace talks ... and, as peace is established, offer to begin to invest in recovery and reconstruction," said the new [[United Kingdom|British]] Prime Minister [[w:Gordon Brown|Gordon Brown]] on Tuesday while visiting the UN headquarters in [[New York]].

Troops are expected to be in the region no later than December of this year but may take up to a year to fully deploy. This will be the largest peacekeeping force ever deployed and cost over US$2 billion per year to keep the force in the region. The resolution does not allow for more than 26,000 troops to be deployed.

UN Security Council calls on Iran to suspend uranium enrichment
{{date|March 29, 2006}}

The [[U.N.]] {{w|UN Security Council|Security Council}} has unanimously approved a non-binding statement earlier today reaffirming its commitment to the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NTP)}}, including the right of NTP states to "develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination", and also calling for Iran to temporarily suspend this right &mdash; including all activities related to uranium enrichment and reprocessing, including research and development activities &mdash; in order to "{{w|Confidence and Security-Building Measures|build confidence}} in the exclusively peaceful purpose of its nuclear programme and to resolve outstanding questions".

The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council agreed on the statement earlier today. This is the first action by the Security Council over the alleged fears of some countries that Iran wants to join the {{w|List of countries with nuclear weapons|growing list}} of nations possessing nuclear weapons.

The Security Council requested that in addition to the {{w|IAEA|International Atomic Energy Agency}}'s ongoing inspections in Iran, that it monitor Iran's compliance with "the steps required by the IAEA Board".  [[Russia]] and [[China]], two members of the Security Council, have stated opposition to using force or imposing sanctions on Iran.

The IAEA was requested to file a report in thirty days' time.

UN sanctions prompt Iran to limit cooperation with IAEA
{{Iran nuclear program}}
{{date|March 26, 2007}}

The government of [[Iran]] will be limiting its cooperation with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) a government spokesperson said, just a day after the [[United Nations]] voted to impose sanctions on Iran.

"It is not a new issue for the Iranian nation. Enemies of the Iranian nation have made a mistake this time too. [Sanctions] will not halt Iran's peaceful nuclear program even for a second. The Iranian nation will not forget those who backed and those who rejected (the resolution), while adjusting its international relations," said the president of Iran, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].

Gholam Hossein Elham, a spokesman for the Iranian government said that the country would be halting all "code 1-3 of minor arrangements of the safeguards" with the IAEA and will "continue until Iran's nuclear case is referred back to the IAEA from the [[U.N Security Council]]."

Elham also said that the sanctions imposed on the country are "illegal" and also said that the U.N. is "bullying" the nation.

{{w|Alejandro Wolff}}, the acting [[United States]] Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said that the sanctions "sent a clear and unambiguous message to Iran" that continuing to build a nuclear program "will only further isolate Iran and make it less, not more, secure."

Venezuelan President Chavez criticises U.S. President Bush in U.N. address
{{date|September 21, 2006}}

In an address to the UN General Assembly in New York on September 20, 2006 Hugo Chávez, President of Venezuela, sharply criticized the US government and its policies.

At the same time he announced his country's bid for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council, saying that it will speak for all countries which "have no power, no power to make any impact on the terrible situation in the world" for which, he indicated, the US is responsible. 

President [[w:Hugo Chávez|Hugo Chávez]] said that the greatest terrorist threat for the world is the US government and its imperialistic policies. When speaking to the assembly, Chávez displayed the book "[[w:Hegemony or Survival|Hegemony or Survival]]", written by [[w:Noam Chomsky|Noam Chomsky]], and recommended "this excellent book" to the audience. He described this book as being written "clearly and in depth" an that "the American empire is doing all it can to consolidate its system of domination."

He said that "the hegemonic intentions of the imperialistic power are threatening the world", and called on all the peoples of the world, including Americans, to respond to that threat.

He warned Americans that "The devil is right at home. The devil -- the devil, himself, is right in the house. And the devil came here yesterday.", apparently referring to the United States President [[w:George W. Bush]].

Hugo Chavez criticized Bush, saying the he was "talking as if he owned the world", and called him "the spokesman of imperialism". 

Talking about the US efforts at nation-building, he said that it is "a very original democracy that's imposed by weapons and bombs and firing weapons.", adding "What a strange democracy. Aristotle might not recognize it or others who are at the root of democracy."

When pushing his agenda of democracy and free trade in Latin America, Chávez accused President Bush of being a racist, saying that President Bush would look "at your color" and he say "oh, there's an extremist. [[w:Evo Morales|Evo Morales]], the worthy president of Bolivia, looks like an [[w:extremist|extremist]] to him."

Chavez indicated Bush discriminates against Morales because Morales was the country's first Indian president.
The newly elected president of Bolivia, announced plans of socializing part of the energy resources, particularly gas in Bolivia in 2005 in a move to try to be more independent from multinational coorporations.

As the president of the Bolivian Senate, Santos Ramirez, put it: "Bolivia and Latin America are no longer the servile democracies that tolerate...poverty and the surrendering of sovereignty."

Chavez is pushing his own socio-economic agenda. For example the People's Trade Treaty consisting of Bolivia, Venezuela and Cuba and [[w:Mercosur|Mercosur]], an economic union designed after the [[w:European Union|European Union]] for which in turn Bush sharply criticized him.

Chavez defended Morales in his speech by saying "The imperialists see extremists everywhere. It's not that we are extremists. It's that the world is waking up."

Chavez referred to Bush's speech the day before, when Bush directly addressed the peoples of Afghanistan, Lebanon and Iran, telling the assembly "what would those peoples of the world tell him if they were given the floor? What would they have to say? - They would say, "Yankee imperialist, go home."".

To address the current political issues he mentioned, Chavez complained that "But we, the assembly, have been turned into a merely deliberative organ. We have no power, no power to make any impact on the terrible situation in the world. And that is why Venezuela once again proposes, here, today, 20 September, that we re-establish the United Nations."

In particular. he criticized the "the anti-democratic" veto held by the Permanent Five members of the Security Council,
Citing the "immoral" veto of the United States which he said, "allowed the Israelis, with impunity, to destroy Lebanon.", referring to the [[w:2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]]

Chavez said that he wants to provide an "alternative way of thinking" and canvassed for the support of the international community for Venezuela to attain a seat on the [[w:United Nations Security Council|United Nations Security Council]] to "to save our planet, to save the planet from the imperialist threat." and "for our children and our grandchildren a world of peace based on the fundamental principles of a renewed United Nations."

==U.S. Response==
U.N. Ambassador John Bolton said the remarks don't warrant a response.
The US is currently lobbying for Venezuela not to attain a seat on the U.N. Security Council.

Rep. Charles Rangel (Democrats) who represents a New York City neighborhood which Chavez recently visited said 
"I just want to make it abundantly clear to Hugo Chavez or any other president - don't come to the United States and think because we have problems with our president that any foreigner can come to our country and not think that Americans do not feel offended when you offend our Chief of State. Any demeaning public attack against him is viewed by Republicans and Democrats, and all Americans, as an attack on all of us."

Presidential candidate of Haiti, Dany Toussaint, arrested by United Nations troops
{{date|January  3, 2006}}

Former senator and former police chief Dany Toussaint was arrested by United Nations troops on alleged possession of illegal weapons.  According to police sources Toussaint was arrested by Chilean troops when they found the weapons on him in Cap-Haitien.  Toussaint was driving through a police checkpoint when the troops spotted the weapons and arrested him.

One police official said, "Dany Toussaint was carrying several weapons for which he has no valid authorization."

Among the alleged weapons are those obtained from parliament when Toussaint became a senator, but they were to be returned when his term as senator ended.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has suspected Toussaint of drug trafficking in the past.  Toussaint was also the suspect in the 2000 murder of a radio journalist, Jean Dominique.  Currently Toussaint runs a private security company.

Two car bombs kill scores in Algiers, Algeria
{{date|December 11, 2007}}
[[Image:LocationAlgeria.svg|thumb|right|250px|Location of Algeria]]
Two bombs have exploded in [[Algiers]], the capital of [[Algeria]], killing at least 67 people. Both explosions were car bombs, at least one of which is being called a {{w|suicide attack|suicide bombing}}.

The first explosion took place in the Ben Aknoun district in the center of the city, which is near the constitutional court. The second was near the [[United Nations]] offices in the Hydra neighborhood. A UN worker said to the BBC that the building has partially collapsed and people may be trapped inside.

Jean Fabre, of the {{w|United Nations Development Programme}}, said that 10 staff members had been killed by the bomb which was outside the {{w|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}}'s offices.

Several of the victims in the Ben Aknoun attack were students who were in a passing bus.

Officials believe that the attacks were carried out by The [[al-Qaeda]] Organization in the Islamic Maghreb, which was previously known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat and sometimes still referred to as such.
{{QuoteLeft|I would like to condemn it in the strongest terms - it cannot be justified in any circumstances|4=UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon 
}}
Algiers suffered a {{w|11 April 2007 Algiers bombings|similar attack}} on April 11 of this year when two suicide car bombers claimed the lives of 33 people. According to Reuters, some people in Algeria have begun to speculate that the attacks on the 11th of the month is an homage to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] against the [[United States]].

Anis Rahmani, security expert and editor of a local paper, told Reuters that "al Qaeda wanted to send a strong message that it is still capable despite the lost of several top leaders. Now the key problem is that social conditions are still offering chances for terrorists to hire new rebels."

{{w|United Nations Secretary-General}} [[Ban Ki-moon]] condemned the attacks while in [[Indonesia]] for the [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]: "This is just unacceptable. I would like to condemn it in the strongest terms. It cannot be justified in any circumstances." 

[[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the President of [[France]], who recently visited Algeria, called the attacks "barbaric, hateful and deeply cowardly acts." 

"President Sarkozy has just called President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika|Bouteflika]] to express the French people's solidarity and compassion towards the Algerian people," said presidential spokesperson David Martinon.

White House spokesperson Gordon Johndroe said: "The United States stands with the people of Algeria, as well as the United Nations, as they deal with this senseless violence."

The Algerian Prime Minister {{w|Abdelaziz Belkhadem}} called off a cabinet meeting to allow him to visit the injured in the hospital.

At least 10,000 reported dead after Burma cyclone
{{date|May 5, 2008}}
{{Myanmar}}At least 10,000 people are dead and another 3,000 are missing after [[w:Cyclone Nargis|Cyclone Nargis]] hit the country of [[Myanmar]], according to Foreign Minister [[w:Nyan Win|Nyan Win]], who spoke on state television. Just hours later [[w:Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua News Agency]] reported that government officials had told them that 15,000 were dead.

The [[United Nations]] (UN) calls the report "alarming". Paul Risley, a spokesperson for the [[w:World Food Programme|World Food Programme]] said, "The UN will begin preparing assistance now to be delivered and transported to Myanmar as quickly as possible."
[[Image:Nargis 01 may 2008 0440Z.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of the cyclone Nargis.]]
"The UN will do whatever it can to provide urgent humanitarian assistance. Because of the lack of communications, we are not quite sure what will be the total extent of damages and casualties. I am very much alarmed by incoming views that casualties have risen to more than 10,000, according to Myanmar's foreign ministry," said the Secretary-General of the UN, [[w:Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]].

The death toll has risen from Sunday's count of only 351 deaths.

Food and water has become scarce and hundreds of thousands of people are homeless with several towns being completely destroyed. In the city of [[w:Yangon|Yangon]], there is no power and much of the drinking water has been contaminated.

"What is clear is that we are dealing with a major emergency situation, and the priority needs now are shelter and clean drinking water," said United Nations disaster response spokesman, Richard Horsey.

There are 47.8 million people living in Myanmar with over 5 million in Yangon.

Suspected poisonous gas found in New York
{{date|August 30, 2007}}
[[Image:Phosgene-3D-vdW.png|150px|thumb|right|Three dimensional model of phosgene, COCl2.]]
At least six to eight vials containing a reportedly poisonous gas were found at a [[United Nations]] (U.N.) office in [[New York]], according to reports released today. The vials were potentially hazardous and reportedly came from a chemical plant in [[Iraq]].
[[Image:New York City Midtown from the East River UN.jpg|thumb|left|The [[w:United Nations Headquarters|United Nations Headquarters]] building.]]
U.N. deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe assured the public they were not in danger saying, "There is no immediate risk or danger." However, the [[w:UNMOVIC|U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC) building was evacuated, according to federal authorities.

The recovered gas was believed to be [[w:phosgene|phosgene]], which is used to make pesticides and plastics. The gas can be hazardous at room temperature, according to the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (C.D.C.). The gas was used frequently throughout [[w:World War I|World War I]].

The gas was brought to the U.S. from a chemical weapons plant north of [[w:Baghdad|Baghdad]] in 1996.

Ewen Buchanan, a UNMOVIC spokesman, said the phosgene gas was in liquid form, "ranging in size from small vials to tubes the length of a pen," she said. 

Jerry Hauer, former New York City emergency services director, told ABC News that "If it is properly sealed, it should not pose much of a threat unless it is dropped" and "They need to get it out of there and put it in a safe canister...It shows immense stupidity to have that kind of thing sitting around as a [[w:souvenir|souvenir]]."

No toxic vapors were found in the air and no one was injured. [[w:Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents, [[w:Weapons of mass destruction|WMD]] teams, as well as [[w:hazmat|hazmat]] units were all reporting to the scene.

UK opposition leader calls for Burma aid to be dispatched by air if access for aid workers does not improve
{{date|May 12, 2008}}
{{Cyclone Nargis}}
[[David Cameron]], the leader of the main [[UK]] opposition party, the [[w:en:Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]],  has said that aid to [[w:Burma|Burma]] should be dispatched by air if the Burmese government does not improve access to the country for aid workers.

David Cameron said this in a statement, which was released today. Below is part of the statement:

{{cquote|If the Burmese government does not agree to the distribution of aid on the scale required, then the case for unilateral delivery of aid by the international community will only grow stronger. There was general frustration at what the United Nations itself can or would do. Again, as time runs out for the people of the Irrawaddy Delta, and as a fresh storm approaches the area this week, the case for the United Nations invoking the 'responsibility to protect' - which could trigger action by the rest of the international community - grows stronger too. The argument against this is that China - and Russia - would be bound to block it. But the Chinese have a choice: either they put effective pressure on the regime to save lives, in which case aid will get through - or not, in which case the argument for invoking the UN's 'responsibility to protect' will get stronger still.}}

However [[David Miliband]], British Foreign Secretary and [[w:en:Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] member, told the [[w:en:BBC|BBC]]'s [[w:en:Politics Show|''Politics Show'']] yesterday that air delivery is "not a very effective way of delivering aid" and that "humanitarian experts and aid workers who make all the difference on the ground are clear that that is very much the third, fourth, fifth or even sixth best solution."

[[w:en:Nick Clegg|Nick Clegg]], leader of Britain's second largest opposition party, the [[w:en:Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]], took Cameron's side however, saying that the international community ought to support direct aid-dropping "to show that we mean business".

22,464 people have been confirmed dead from [[w:Cyclone Nargis|Cyclone Nargis]], with the majority of the casualties having taken place in Burma. Only once rescue workers reached the hardest hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the extent of damage that had occurred. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the [[w:Pyapon District|Pyapon District]] of the country.

The United Nations has reported that one million people are homeless, or in need of help in some other way.

Iran says it may withdraw from Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
{{date|May 7, 2006}}

[[File:Iran nuclear illustration.png|right|220px]]
In a letter to the [[United Nations]], [[Iran]]'s Parliament has said it may have to withdraw from the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty}} if pressure to end its nuclear program escalates.

The letter to UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] stated that if the issues with Iran's nuclear program are not settled by peaceful methods, then "there will be no option for the parliament but to ask the government to withdraw its signature."

"Should the UN secretary general and [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] members not fulfill their crucial duties in settling arguments, there will be no choice for the {{w|Majlis of Iran|Majlis}} but to demand the government withdraw the ratification of the additional protocol and put on its agenda a review of Article 10 of the NPT," said the letter, signed by at least 160 deputies.

In the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Article 10 states that a country can withdraw its signatories from the treaty if the interests of the country have been compromised. In 2003, [[North Korea]] withdrew from the treaty for the same reason.

"We will not accept any resolution that is against our rights. Any action by the Security Council will have a negative influence on our cooperation with the agency. The involvement of the Security Council will direct the path of cooperation towards confrontation. It's obvious that the Security Council should not take any action that it is not capable of dealing with later because we will not refrain from our rights," said Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi in a press conference on Sunday.

"Suspension and pause is not on the agenda at all, and the Security Council should not do something that will get it into trouble later on," and "intervention by the Security Council in this issue is completely illegal," added Asefi.

United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan still urges Iran and the [[United States]] to hold direct talks. According to journalist and anti-nuclear-weapons activist {{w|Praful Bidwai}}, Iran is "keen to reach a deal or compromise on the nuclear issue" and "numerous governmental and non-governmental experts" in Iran believe that there is "fairly broad agreement" that a compromise proposal could be negotiated which would be politically acceptable in Iran. 

Annan stated, "If everybody - all stakeholders and key players - were around the table, I think it would be possible to work out a package that would satisfy the concerns of everybody. Should they (Iran) be offered a diplomatic package allowing them to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful ends, and they resist that, how do they explain it to the world?"

Asefi also said that Iran isn't prepared to discuss it's nuclear program with the United States "one-on-one".

"The U.S. isn't prepared to have talks on a one-to-one equal basis. They are following the politics of threat. So under these conditions we see no necessity to start talks with them," said Asefi. 

{{w|Raw Story}} earlier made claims from unnamed intelligence sources that some parts of the US administration are opposed to diplomatic activities with Iran. It claimed that US vice-president [[Dick Cheney]] and Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] are carrying out "an ongoing attempt ... to squash diplomatic activities" and using {{w|Manucher Ghorbanifar}}, a key figure in the {{w|Iran-Contra Affair}}, to monitor and report on "any interaction and attempts at negotiations between Iranian officials and US ambassador to Iraq, {{w|Zalmay Khalilzad}}."

The treaty was opened for signatures in 1968 and in 1970 entered into force. There are 187 signatures on the treaty.

German BND claims U.S. exaggerated Iraq WMD claims
{{date|November 20, 2005}}
{{2003 Iraq pre-war intelligence infobox}}
One of the most important arguments in the run-up to the Iraq war made by Colin Powell in his United Nations speech and President Bush in his State of the Union address was that Iraq had an active biological weapons program and possessed mobile biological weapons labs. According to an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the main source for this information was an Iraqi defector codenamed [[w:Curveball (informant)|Curveball]] who was a source for the German central intelligence agency [[w:Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]].

Several German intelligence officials responsible for Curveball have now told the LA Times that the Bush administration and the CIA have repeatedly exaggerated his claims and ignored warnings of the BND that the source was unreliable. Recounting his reaction after seeing Powell's United Nations speech one German intelligence officer said: "We were shocked. Mein Gott! We had always told them it was not proven.... It was not hard intelligence." This corroborates reporting by the German weekly newspaper [[w:Die Zeit|Die Zeit]] from 2003 and 2004 based on statements of unnamed senior German intelligence officials.

Nine months earlier, in May 2002, a fabricator warning was posted in Curveball's file in U.S. intelligence databases. Powell was never warned that his United Nations speech contained material that both the DIA and CIA had determined was false, even though several people present at Powell's CIA meetings were fully aware of this.

At this time German intelligence officers would not let the CIA meet directly with Curveball, but allowed a CIA doctor to draw blood samples. Questioning the validity of Curveball's information in front of his CIA supervisor, the doctor was advised to "Keep in mind that this war is going to happen regardless of what Curveball said or didn't say and the Powers That Be probably aren't terribly interested in whether Curveball knows what he's talking about."

Shortly after Powell's UN speech and several days before the invasion, United Nations weapons inspectors attempted to directly verify several key claims made by Curveball, but concluded that they were unsustainable. The White House insisted on its WMD claims based on Curveball's information.

Even after the invasion, when more and more of Curveball's accounts were shown to be pure fabrication, the CIA and the Bush administration relied on Curveball's information. When U.S. forces discovered trucks with lab equipment and Curveball claimed that these were identical to the ones he has been reporting about, the CIA rushed to publish a White Paper claiming that these trucks were part of Saddam Hussein's secret biological weapons program and Bush claimed publicly that "We found the weapons of mass destruction." Several days later, twelve of the thirteen WMD experts who analyzed the trucks agreed that the equipment was not suited for biological weapons production, with the only dissenting voice coming from the author of the original White Paper. 

The White Paper remains posted on the CIA website to this date, and President Bush has not yet retracted his statement that Iraq produced "germ warfare agents" made in his State of the Union address or his postwar assertions that "we found the weapons of mass destruction."

Ignored warnings 'worsened' situation in Myanmar
{{date|May 10, 2008}}
{{Cyclone Nargis}}People studying the situation in [[Myanmar]] are claiming that an inadequate response of the government of Myanmar (formerly Burma) to scientists' warnings about the cyclone, coupled with large-scale destruction of protective mangroves along its coasts, aggravated the devastation wreaked by tropical Cyclone Nargis.

The cyclone has killed an estimated 22,980 people so far, with millions rendered homeless by the disaster, which struck the Irrawaddy Delta region of Myanmar last week (3 May).

Scientists at the [[w:Indian Meteorological Department|Indian Meteorological Department]] (IMD) in [[w:New Delhi|New Delhi]], the[[w: World Meteorological Organisation| World Meteorological Organisation]]'s specialist centre for Asia, say they issued the first of the cyclone bulletins to Myanmar as early as 26 April. 

Mrityunjay Mohapatra, director of IMD's cyclone-warning centre, told SciDev.Net that Myanmar was warned of the impending cyclone at least 48 hours in advance. But there was no acknowledgement from Myanmar's meteorological office, or any indication of a response.

Mohapatra says IMD's first warning bulletin, issued on 1 May, indicated the land area likely to be hit by the cyclone. It warned that a cyclone with wind speeds of 180 kilometres per hour would cross the southwest coast of Myanmar sometime between 8pm and midnight on the night of the 2 May.

IMD's bulletins contain information on the actual and predicted centre, intensity and movement of the cyclone, as well as sea conditions and maximum wind speeds around the cyclone centre.

Uma Charan Mohanty, from the [[w:Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre|Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre]] in [[Thailand]], said that, according to the World Meteorological Organisation's data, Asian cyclones are fewer and less intense than hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean or typhoons in the Pacific Ocean region, but they cause more death and destruction. In 2005, 25 hurricanes in the Atlantic caused 10 deaths, but cyclone Sidr, which hit Bangladesh in 2007, left 3,500 dead.

Mohanty says that the [[w:Atlantic|Atlantic]] coast has a good early-warning system and people have the means to drive to safer areas. In contrast, Asian coasts are densely populated, with many poor fishing and farming communities who cannot evacuate on their own, even if they have been warned.

News agencies quote Maung Swe, Myanmar's minister for relief and resettlement, who told a press conference (6 May) that most deaths were caused by a 3.5-metre-high storm surge — a wall of water that develops when cyclonic winds churn up sea water.

Mohanty says that 85 per cent of cyclone deaths are due to storm surges and that predictions of the size and location of such surges are critical in disaster forecasting.

Asian coasts are also becoming increasingly vulnerable because of the loss of protective mangrove forests that serve as windbreaks and limit damage by storm and tidal surges.

In a 2006 report, the [[w:International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for Conservation of Nature]] said that areas in [[Sri Lanka]] with mangrove forests suffered less damage in the 2004 Asian tsunami, compared with regions where forests had been destroyed.

And in January 2008, the [[w:UN Food and Agriculture Organization|UN Food and Agriculture Organization]] warned that [[Asia]] is fast losing its coastal mangroves, with more than 1.9 million hectares being destroyed each year.

The organisation's report reviewed the world's mangroves between 1980 and 2005. It found that the mangrove forests around Myanmar's Irrawady Delta had degraded because of "overexploitation" and the conversion of land for rice fields — promoted by the government as a way to ensure self-sufficiency in food production.

Government officials in Myanmar have said that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from [[w:Cyclone Nargis|Cyclone Nargis]].

Only once rescue workers reached the hardest hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the extent of damage that had occurred. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the [[w:Pyapon District|Pyapon District]] of the country.

The United Nations has reported that one million people are homeless, or in need of help in some other way.

International bodies express concern over Israel-Hezbollah conflict
{{date|July 20, 2006}}
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
International {{w|Humanitarianism|humanitarian}} organisations and [[human rights]] watchdogs have expressed concerns over the rising civilian casualties and the humanitarian crisis caused by the {{w|2006 Israel-Lebanon crisis|ongoing conflict}} in [[Lebanon]] and northern [[Israel]]. They have also warned the warring groups that their conduct may not comply with {{w|International humanitarian law|international laws}} governing the safety of civilians in combat areas. 

==UNCHR statement==
[[Image:UNCHR Logo.gif|80px|left|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights logo]] 
The {{w|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights}} {{w|Louise Arbour}} expressed grave concern over the growing civilian casualties in the conflict in [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]] and the {{w|Israeli-occupied territories|occupied Palestinian territory}} and called for accountability for any breaches of international law in a statement released on Wednesday.

The statement said that indiscriminate shelling of cities and the targeting of supposed military sites which would possibly result in civilians deaths is unacceptable and unjustifiable. It called for respecting the  principle of proportionality in reacting to enemy action. 

The statement reminded parties to the conflict that the obligation to protect civilians during hostilities is expressed in international criminal law, and warned that the scale and predictability of the killings in the region may attach personal criminal responsibility of those involved, especially those in positions of command and control.

The High Commissioner also warned of the deteriorating humanitarian situation, especially in southern Lebanon, where large numbers of people are 
reported to be increasingly deprived of access to basic services and are forcibly displaced. She called for unrestricted and secure passage for all humanitarian assistance.

==Red Cross' assessment==
[[Image:Emblem of the ICRC.svg|left|100px|ICRC Flag]]
In a press briefing in Geneva, The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC)   
director of operations Pierre Krähenbühl gave the ICRC's assessment of the humanitarian situation engendered by the conflict. 

He said that the large number of civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure "raises serious questions" over the warring parties' compliance  to the principle of proportionality in combat operations.

In the briefing, he stated the reported death toll as about 230 killed and 600 wounded in Lebanon and 13 civilians killed and over 150 wounded in Israel.

He said that medical assistance and evacuation for those in need is severely limited by the ongoing hostilities and that the safety of the medical mission is "deeply problematic". He pointed out that large numbers of people are fleeing the conflict zones.

He called on Israel's air and sea blockade of Lebanon to allow food and other essential supplies to reach the affected civilian population.

He stated that the ICRC has reminded the parties to the conflict, publicly and in private, of their obligation to distinguish between civilians and military targets, their obligation to respect the principle of proportionality, and to protect the medical aid services, to spare civilians and ensure secure access to medical help for all.

The representations have been made in Israel with the Ministry of foreign affairs and Army command, and in Lebanon with the Prime minister and also to [[Hezbollah]], with whom the ICRC has contact.

==Human Rights Watch==
[[Image:Hrw logo.gif|left|80px|Human Rights Watch logo]]
The watchdog group {{w|Human Rights Watch}} warned [[Hezbollah]] on attacking civilian targets in Israel and called on Israel to allow relief convoys safe entry into and passage inside Lebanon, 

A press release by the group said that Hezbollah rocket attacks on Sunday and Monday were "at best indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas, at worst the deliberate targeting of civilians" and called them serious violations of international humanitarian law and "probable war crimes". The rockets launched against {{w|Haifa}} over the past two days contained hundreds of metal ball bearings that are of limited use against military targets but cause great harm to civilians and civilian property, it said.

A release also said that border towns in Lebanon are already facing serious shortages of food and medicine, and are in urgent need of supplies. It called for safe passage for aid convoys in the wake on an Israeli missile attack on an aid convoy, reported by the [[Red Crescent Society]] of the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). According to the UAE RC, the convoy was clearly marked as a relief operation, contained medical supplies and medicines, as well as several ambulances and that at least one person was killed in the attack.

==Amnesty International==
[[Image:Amnesty International Logo.gif|30px|left|Amnesty International Logo]]
[[Amnesty International]] (AI) today called on the UN [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] to meet urgently in order to adopt measures to protect civilians caught up in the deepening Israel-Lebanon conflict. It alleged that [[G8]] member states, during the recently concluded summit, had failed to "put the protection of civilians above politics" in their discussions of the conflict. AI condemned continuing attacks on civilians by both Israel and Hezbollah.

==Responses from Israel and Hezbollah==
An Israeli official told the BBC "We feel that proportionality should be judged in terms of the threat we face. This is not just an issue of the kidnappings. Hezbollah has a huge arsenal and has fired 1,000 missiles at us. We are acting in self-defence". He also said that Hezbollah often hides in civilian areas and that Israel had dropped fliers and gave other warnings to civilians to leave before an attack.

Also, Vice Premier Shimon Peres questioned the reported casualty count in Lebanon, saying in an interview with CNN, "the numbers of the victims [in Lebanon] are not acceptable. We think that information coming from Lebanon is totally unreliable." 

Hezbollah says its capture of Israeli soldiers was to use them in a "bargain" with Israel and that Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israel are a retaliation to Israeli strikes against Lebanon and its civilians. Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah leader, said "When the Zionists behave like there are no rules and no red lines and no limits to the confrontation, it is our right to behave in the same way."

Mugabe claims 'sweeping victory' of Zimbawe election
{{date|June 29, 2008}}
[[Image:Mugabecloseup2008.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A file photograph of Mugabe]][[Robert Mugabe]], the Zimbabwean president who has recently been widely criticized by world leaders, has claimed the current results show that he will have a 'sweeping victory' in the unopposed presidential run-off elections.

Mugabe announced his victory on one of the state run television networks. "The returns show that we are winning convincingly, that we have won in all the 26 constituencies in Harare, an MDC stronghold where we won in only one constituency in March," he said.

Robert Mugabe was recently under a large amount of pressure to postpone the election after the main opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, pulled out due to fears of violence. For example, [[Ban Ki-moon]], secretary general of the [[United Nations]] yesterday called for the election to be postponed. He said that he "strongly supports the statement of the Chairman of SADC ([[w:Southern African Development Community|Southern African Development Community]]) that conditions do not exist for a run-off election to be held at this time and that they should be postponed."

Kenyan Prime Minister calls for suspension of Mugabe from African Union
{{date|June 30, 2008}}
{{Zimbabwe}}{{w|Raila Odinga}}, the [[Kenya]]n Prime Minister, has said that [[Robert Mugabe]] should be suspended from the [[African Union]] until he allows free elections to take place in his country.

He has said that the AU "should suspend him [Mugabe] and send peace forces to [[Zimbabwe]] to ensure free and fair elections." 

Odinga continued, "[The] African Union will be setting a dangerous precedent if Mugabe is allowed to participate in its meetings," he said. "Right now Mugabe is a crisis, they have no president with legitimacy to run the country."

Robert Mugabe was recently under a large amount of pressure to postpone the election after the main opposition candidate, {{w|Morgan Tsvangirai}}, pulled out due to fears of violence. For example, [[Ban Ki-moon]], secretary general of the [[United Nations]], yesterday called for the election to be postponed. He said that he "strongly supports the statement of the Chairman of SADC ({{w|Southern African Development Community}}) that conditions do not exist for a run-off election to be held at this time and that they should be postponed." 

Mugabe yesterday claimed the current results show that he will have a 'sweeping victory' in the unopposed presidential run-off elections. He announced his victory on one of the state run television networks. "The returns show that we are winning convincingly, that we have won in all the 26 constituencies in Harare, an MDC stronghold where we won in only one constituency in March." 

As an African Union summit began in [[Egypt]] today, Mugabe took his seat among other African heads of state hours after declaring victory in the election. His appearance at the summit generated different reactions, from being hailed as a "hero" by the President of [[Gabon]], to U.N. Deputy Secretary-General {{w|Asha-Rose Migiro}}'s remarks calling the situation in Zimbabwe "an extremely grave crisis".

Mugabe, now in his sixth term as President, arrived in the Egyptian city of {{w|Sharm el-Sheikh}} on Monday. Despite criticism from the African Union's election observers, who said the election fell short of their standards, Mugabe was reportedly warmly received at the summit. One delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mugabe was seen hugging other African leaders after the opening session.

Delegates at the convention discussed the elections, but largely avoided direct criticism of Mugabe or the government. {{w|Jakaya Kekwete}}, the [[Tanzania]]n President chairing the summit, said, "We would like to congratulate the Zimbabwean people for their successes but we would also like to express our commiserations for their suffering." A draft resolution being considered for adoption on Tuesday calls for negotiations and an end to violence, but also does not directly criticize Mugabe or the election.

George Sibotshiwe, a spokesman for Tsvangirai's {{w|Movement for Democratic Change}}, said he hopes that the summit would take stronger measures during Tuesday sessions. "I would hope that the nature of what happened in Zimbabwe warrants a strong response and a lot of the leaders are taking our problems into consideration," he said.

Mugabe spokeperson tells critics to 'go hang'
{{date|July 1, 2008}}
{{Zimbabwe}}[[w:George Charamba|George Charamba]], a spokesperson for the widely criticized leader of [[Zimbabwe]], has said that critics of the situation in the country should "go hang a thousand times". 

At a press conference today Chambera was asked whether a national unity government, like that in [[Kenya]], should  be formed in Zimbabwe. He answered by saying that "we have our own history of evolving dialogue and resolving political impasses the Zimbabwean way. The Zimbabwean way, not the Kenyan way. Not at all."

Robert Mugabe was recently under a large amount of pressure to postpone the election after the main opposition candidate, [[w:Morgan Tsvangirai|Morgan Tsvangirai]], pulled out due to fears of violence.

A car bomb was used in an attack on the [[India|Indian]] embassy in central [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]] on Monday morning.  The bombing killed 41, and injured at least 141. It is the deadliest attack in Kabul since 2001, when Afghanistan's [[Afghan Taliban|Taliban]] government was ousted by American armed forces.

The attack happened at the gates of the embassy, located in central Kabul, near many other government buildings including the office of the Interior Ministry of Afghanistan. A security office and part of a wall were destroyed, and the blast was large enough to spread debris to surrounding buildings. Ali Hassan Fahimi, whose office is nearby, said shrapnel landed in his office. "It was so strong... our staff were shocked," he commented.

Many of the victims were Afghans who were lining up for visas to travel to India. Of the casualties, most were civilians. The dead include embassy workers, a defense attache, a senior counselor, two security guards, an Afghan employee and six police officers.

The foreign ministry of Afghanistan said that they "condemn today's terrorist attack on the embassy of the friendly and brother country of India." An Afghan government spokesman, Zamari Bashari, suggested that the attack was retaliation for India's support for reconstruction in Afghanistan. India called the bombing a "cowardly terrorist attack" and said that they would send a delegation to investigate.

Foreign entities voiced similar sentiments. The [[United Nations]] envoy {{w|Kai Eide}} said, "I condemn it in the strongest possible terms. In no culture, no country, and no religion is there any excuse or justification for such acts. The total disregard for innocent lives is staggering and those behind this must be held responsible." The [[European Union]] condemned the attack as a "terrorist attack targeting innocent civilians" and the [[United States]] said it was a "needless act of violence". The foreign minister of [[Pakistan]], [[Shah Mahmood Qureshi]], denounced the attack, saying, "Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations as this menace negates the very essence of human values."

Philippines ferry disaster: ship owner sues over toxic cargo; recovery deadline set & more
{{date|July 8, 2008}}
{{Philippines}}Several new developments have occurred surrounding the loss of [[the Philippines|Philippine]] ferry [[MV Princess of the Stars|MV ''Princess of the Stars'']], which capsized and sank on June 21 during a severe storm. The loss near {{w|Sibuyan}} island during {{w|Typhoon Fengshen}}, known locally as Frank, killed more than 800 of those on board.

Ship owner [[Sulpicio Lines]] has sued {{w|Del Monte}} Philippines for failing to declare a cargo of the dangerous pesticide {{w|endosulfan}} that was on board. Sulpicio yesterday sued the Board of Marine Inquiry (BMO) for allegedly making comments contributing to negative publicity surrounding the line and asked a court to stop the body continuing its investigation, saying it no longer had any authority. Today, that request was denied.

Another outcome of today's proceedings is a deadline for Sulpicio to recover the ship. The company has ninety days to ensure the recovery operation is complete.

Yesterday, an eight-page complaint was filed against Del Monte at [[Manila|Manila City]]'s regional trial court. It alleges that Del Monte violated the line's terms by failing to inform Sulpicio that the shipment included edosulfan. The line notes that any toxic cargo should have been declared. Suplicio is seeking {{w|Philippine peso|PHP}}5.5 million from the company for alleged negligence.

"Due to Del Monte’s deceit and non-disclosure, plaintiff was led to believe that the subject shipment of Endosulfan was a regular cargo. Had defendant Del Monte disclosed the toxic nature of the cargo, plaintiff would not have loaded the same on board a passenger-cargo vessel, be it MV ''Princess of the Paradise'' or MV ''Princess of the Stars''," said a statement by Suplicio.
[[Image:Ph locator map romblon.png|thumb|left|180px|The MV ''Princess of the Stars'' capsized off the coast of {{w|Romblon}} on June 21, 2008.]]
The exact total sought as damages is P549,661.11, which accounts for the correct rate for shipping if the toxic cargo had been declared, plus double rates as punitive measures. On top of those damages sought is P3 million to cover specialist recovery required for the chemical, P1 million in moral damges for lost corporate goodwill and damage to Sulpicio's reputation, P500,000 in moral damages for Sulpicio marketing vice president and shareholder Jordan L. Go, P200,000 in exemplary damages and P300,000 in legal costs.

The discovery that the ship was carrying the endosulfan shipment, which totaled 10 metric tons, led to a ban on fishing in the nearby town of {{w|San Fernando, Romblon|San Fernando}} and an emergency cessation of {{w|search and rescue}} activities, which were mostly being conducted by divers. The pesticide is banned in many countries and is subject to various regulations in the Philippines. Water samples from the wreck site show that thus far the pesticide has not leaked.

A specialist joint team is set to arrive soon from the [[European Union]] and the {{w|United Nations Environmental Programme}} to assist with opearations relating to the pesticide, which is a {{w|neurotoxin}}.

The Philippine Coast Guard yesterday awarded some 42 staff divers and six civilian volunteer divers for their work at the ''Princess of the Stars''. They were particularly praised for being keen to return to work. They are awaiting the results of tests for exposure to endosulfan.

Endosulfan is one of the items set for retrieval in a new deadline set by the government task force overseeing the disaster. Sulpicio must also recover the remaining bodies and the unused fuel on board within 90 days.
[[Image:Ph locator romblon san fernando.png|thumb|right|180px|The MV ''Princess of the Stars'' was closest to {{w|San Fernando, Romblon|San Fernando}} when it was hit by Typhoon Fengshen.]]
Sulpicio had initially offered to have the job done in 164 days, but Transportation Undersecretary Elena Bautista rejected this proposal, saying "Out of humanitarian reasons, I told them not to prolong the agony of the victims' relatives all the way to Christmas." Sulpicio was given until Wednesday to name the salvage contractor who would be responsible for recovering the ship, after which they were to submit their retrieval plans to the [[International Maritime Organisation]].

Sulpicio was also given the option of simply towing the ship closer to shore to do the recovery instead of refloating it, which they have opted for. In Bautista's words: "Based on the Sulpicio report this morning, their plan now is to just tow the vessel to the shore, get the hazardous materials out, get the fuel out, and get the people out and I think that would be more cost-effective and most practical because that can be done, maybe within a month, as compared to refloating, which would probably take three months."

Sulpicio is currently considering three different potential salvors, which remain unnamed. They have been told that the company needs to have expertise suitable enough to ensure marine life is not harmed and hazardous materials are not spilled. There is a possibility that the planned towing will damage nearby coral. It is already confirmed by the coastguard that oil onboard cannot leak. Most of the 250,000 litres of bunker fuel are in the service tank, which is considered safe. Only the small amount of oil in the base tank may leak but oil spill containment booms are already in place should this occur.

The government has said that, had Sulpicio not made provisions to get the salvage done, then they would have performed the operation themselves. Had this occurred, Sulpicio would have been charged for it, with the bill estimated at P100 million.

One aspect of another legal case was resolved today. Sulpicio had questioned the authority of the BMI to conduct investigations, instead saying only the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) had the right to do so, and pointing to a separate inquiry started by MARINA. However, a hearing today found that the BMI and MARINA serve different roles. The BMI's role is solely to determine the cause of marine accidents. MARINA's purpose is more concerned with regulations, and is mainly investigating the role of Sulpicio themselves. "We are looking at why we should not cancel the company’s franchise," explained MARINA Administrator Vicente Suazo Jr.

Both investigations are ongoing.

Sudan ambush leaves seven peacekeepers dead, more than a dozen wounded
{{date|July 10, 2008}}
{{Sudan}}At least seven [[United Nations]] [[w:peacekeeper|peacekeeper]]s are dead, and nearly two dozen wounded, after [[w:Janjaweed|Janjaweed]] militants in [[w:Darfur|Darfur]], [[Sudan]], ambushed their convoy around 11:45 [[w:Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]. Five of those troops were from the [[Africa|Africa]]n nation of [[Rwanda]].

Troops fought with militants for over two hours after militants ambushed their convoy of 40 armoured vehicles. Sudanese media states that ten were wrecked beyond repair.

Hafiz Mohammed, who leads the Sudan program at Justice Africa in [[w:London, England|London]], [[England]], says the latest attack reflects the deteriorating security situation on the ground and that everyone in Sudan is at risk of being attacked.
[[Image:Rwandan Soldiers airlifted to Darfur 17july2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Rwandan soldiers board a US transport aircraft at [[w:Kigali International Airport|Kigali International Airport]] for deployment in Darfur in 2005.]]
"The situation is very bad. Instead of actually protecting the civilians, they will end up not able even to protect themselves. It's sad to see this happening. It's going to discourage countries to contribute to the unit, which is creating problems. This is the security situation in Darfur, nobody is immune from being attacked," said Mohammed.

The U.N. has condemned the attack releasing a statement saying, "the secretary-general ([[Ban Ki-moon]]) condemns in the strongest possible terms this unacceptable act of extreme violence against AU-U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur and calls on the government of Sudan to do its utmost to ensure that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice."

The peacekeepers are part of a joint [[w:African Union|African Union]]-U.N. mission aimed at putting 26,000 troops in the region. So far only around 10,000 of that planned mission have been ordered to the region. Countries unwilling to contribute forces, and constant government restrictions from Sudan, have contributed to the slow movement of troops to the region.

ICC prosecutor seeks arrest of Sudanese president
{{date|July 15, 2008}}
[[Image:Building of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.jpg|thumb|right|The ICC's headquarters in [[w:The Hague|The Hague]].{{image credit|[[w:nl:User:Hanhil|Hanhil]]}}]]
The [[w:International Criminal Court|International Criminal Court]]'s (ICC) Procecutor [[w:Luis Moreno-Ocampo|Luis Moreno-Ocampo]]has accused [[Sudan]]ese President [[w:Omar Hassan al-Bashir|Omar Hassan al-Bashir]] of major crimes committed in the [[Darfur]] region. Mr. Bashir is said to have personally directed a mlitary campaign "to destroy in substantial part the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa" tribes. He has asked the ICC for a warrant to arrest al-Bashir for 10 offences including war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.

Some have criticized the move, saying that it will spark further violence and unrest in the country

Al-Bashir came to rule power in 1989. There has been a racial conflict in the country since 2003. The Arab militia, named the [[w:Janjaweed|Janjaweed]], are a government funded group alleged to have been driving the conflict in the region. Since 2003, as many as 300,000 people have been killed and 2 million people displaced from their homes. 

Al-Bashir has rejected the charges, claiming the ICC has no authority to arrest him as Sudan is not a member of the court.

The [[United Nations]] will evacuate all non-essential peacekeepers in the region however they maintain that they will continue their operation despite the deteriorating security situation.

Cyclone Nargis aid effort to cost one billion US$
{{date|July 21, 2008}}
[[Image:Sign toplped over by Cyclone Nargis.png|thumb|right|Cyclone Nargis caused an unprecedented level of destruction {{image credit|US Government}}]]
According to a new report released jointly by the Government of the [[Myanmar]], the [[w:Association of Southeast Asian Nations|Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) and the [[United Nations]] (UN), the cost of providing aid and funding reconstruction after [[:Category:Cyclone Nargis|Cyclone Nargis]] will be [[w:US$|US]] $1 billion over the next three years. 

ASEAN said in a press release that Cyclone Nargis was the "most devastating natural disaster in Myanmar’s history". They also say that the cyclone had a "similar scale of impact to that of the Indian Ocean Tsunami in Indonesia in 2004". 84,530 died in the cyclone and 53,836 remain missing.

The study also reported that a high number of families are in need of shelter due to the destruction of their property by the cyclone. It says that 57% of people had their home completely destroyed by the cyclone, whilst only 2% of people had no damage to their home.

On May 9, the United Nations requested $187 million in aid for Myanmar, but this figure has increased as the full extent of the damage has been revealed. The amount of donations were several times bigger than the requested amount. By 15 June, around 12 billion [[w:kyat|kyat]], or two billion dollars in donations had already been received by the government of Myanmar, according to the report.

UN renews Darfur peacekeeping mission
{{date|August 3, 2008}}
[[Image:Darfur IDPs 1 camp.jpg|thumb|right|A refugee camp in Darfur]]
The [[United Nations Security Council]] has extended its mandate for the joint UN-African Union peacekeeping force in the [[Darfur]] area of [[Sudan]]. The resolution, adopted to extend the United Nations/African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) mission, was approved by 14 of the 15 Security Council members. The [[United States]] abstained from the vote, saying that the language used in the mandate undermined efforts to bring Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to justice for war crimes.

The vote comes a day after the [[United Nations|UN]] responded to a report by the Save Darfur Coalition that said the Darfur peacekeeping force lacks enough personnel and essential equipment. The UNAMID force currently has only 9,500 troops deployed out of an assigned 26,000, which it blames on Security Council bickering and the demands of Sudan's government.

Texas executes Mexican-born killer despite international appeals
{{date|August 7, 2008}}
{{Crime and law}}Late Tuesday, authorities in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Texas]] carried out the execution of [[w:José Medellín|José Medellín]], a [[Mexico|Mexican]] national convicted of raping and murdering two teenage girls in 1993. The execution was carried out despite being at the center of an international legal dispute with objections from the [[w:International Court of Justice|International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) and [[w:Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]].

José Ernesto Medellín, 33, was born in Mexico but moved to the U.S. as a child. He was [[w:sentenced to death|sentenced to death]] for the 1993 rape and murder of two girls aged 14 and 16 in [[w:Houston, Texas|Houston, Texas]]. On Tuesday at 9:57 p.m. [[w:Central Daylight Time|CDT]], he was given a [[w:lethal injection|lethal injection]] at the [[w:Huntsville Unit|Huntsville Unit]] in [[w:Huntsville, Texas|Huntsville]], according to the [[w:Texas Department of Criminal Justice|Texas Department of Criminal Justice]].

In 2004, the [[w:International Court of Justice|International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) in [[w:The Hague|The Hague]] told US authorities that Medellín's case and other cases of Mexicans facing execution in the U.S. may have constituted a violation of the 1963 [[w:Vienna Convention on Consular Relations|Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]]. Medellín's attorneys had argued that Medellín was not informed of his right to seek legal assistance from the Mexican consulate after his arrest. The United States withdrew from compulsory ICJ jurisdiction in 1986, and therefore accepts the court's jurisdiction only on a case-to-case discretionary basis.

The ICJ ordered a delay in the execution, as well as new hearings for Medellín and 50 other Mexican inmates, to determine if the Vienna Convention was violated in their arrests. President [[George W. Bush]] then ordered Texas to comply with the ICJ's ruling. However, the [[w:Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in March that the [[w:Bush administration|Bush administration]] did not have the authority to intervene in the case.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the United States to "take every step" to stop the execution. "All decisions and orders of the International Court of Justice must be respected by states," he said in [[w:Mexico City|Mexico City]] on Tuesday, less than 12 hours before the execution took place.

Texas governor [[w:Rick Perry|Rick Perry]] denied requests from both Mexican and American officials to delay the execution, citing the manner in which the victims were raped and strangled as justification for the death penalty. "After reviewing all of the facts in what is the most gruesome death penalty case I have reviewed since being in office, I have decided not to grant José Medellín a 30-day reprieve," Perry said.

Medellín's attorneys appealed to the Supreme Court to delay the execution until [[w:United States Congress|Congress]] had an opportunity to pass legislation that would require new hearings for Medellín and other inmates. Shortly before Medellín's execution Tuesday night, the Supreme Court denied the final request for a reprieve with a 5-4 vote.

The Mexican government, which opposes the death penalty, has sent a letter of protest to the U.S. State Department, expressing concern for "the precedent that [the execution] may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained" in the United States.

Russia joins South Ossetian war
{{date|August 8, 2008}} 
{{War in South Ossetia (2008)}}The {{w|2008 South Ossetia War|War in South Ossetia}} has escalated as [[Russia]]n forces are being sent into the conflict on the Ossetian side.

At 10:00 a.m. {{w|UTC+4|local time}}, [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] sources reported that three Russian {{w|Su-24}} attack aircraft invaded Georgian air space and dropped bombs onto a target near the town of Kareli. A later flight dropped one bomb near Gori. While no one was harmed in the second attack, seven people were reportedly injured by the first bombing. According to the {{w|Agence France-Presse}}, a speaker of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called this information "nonsense" and "rubbish".
[[Image:Ossetia-map.png|thumb|left|175px|Map of Georgia; Southern Ossetia is marked in grey. {{image credit|[[w:et:Kasutaja:Urmas|Urmas]]}}]]
At 11:38 a.m. the President of Georgia {{w|Mikheil Saakashvili}} announced the mobilization of reserve troops to withstand what he called "a large-scale military aggression" by Russia, and called Russia to stop the "bombardment of Georgian towns."

{{w|Prime Minister of Russia}} [[Vladimir Putin]] said that, "it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the Olympic Games, the Georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in South Ossetia."

The crisis broke out after days of heavy fighting in the region. On August 7 Georgian troops launched an offensive against the Ossetian town of {{w|Tskhinvali}}, the separatist's capital. 

The Georgian government claims that this is in reaction to attacks by "separatist rebels" on "unarmed civilians and peacekeeping forces" in villages near the town.

At the same time, the state news agency of South Ossetia reports that that Tskhinvali is under heavy artillery fire, with most or all of its population seeking shelter, and apparently a number of buildings already having been destroyed. The {{w|International Committee of the Red Cross}} (ICRC) urged the two sides to set up a "humanitarian corridor" to evacuate civilians and the wounded. The main city hospital is reported not to be functioning, and ambulances can not reach the wounded. Thousands of refugees are leaving South Ossetia, mostly for North Ossetia, says the [[United Nations]] refugee agency.

Georgian officials have claimed that up to four Russian jets have been shot down while attacking Georgia. 

Russia claimed ceasing all civilian aircraft flights to Georgia starting at midnight on August 9. In retaliatory response, Georgia is set to stop all Russian TV channels' broadcasts from August 9th onwards.

According to Russian state news agency {{w|RIA Novosti}} reporting at 9:21pm August 8th, a convoy of 20 vans carrying up to a total of 400 Russian volunteers has crossed from Russia's North Ossetia to South Ossetia.

The government of South Ossetia has announced that it will evacuate children in danger zones to Russia.  This came after a speech made by {{w|Eduard Kokoity}}, President of South Ossetia, which accused the Georgian government of "attempting to spark a full-scale war." Kokoity said that the conflict's victim count has reached 1400.

As of 10:51pm August 8th, 12 Russian peacemakers are reported dead and 150 wounded.

A video tape showing Georgian {{W|Sukhoi Su-25|Su-25}} aircraft being downed was aired on Vesti Russian TV channel late night of August 8th. The pilot of the jet reportedly ejected, but was captured and killed on the ground by Ossetian military.

South Ossetia says it will join North Ossetia-Alania as a federal subject of Russia
{{date|August 30, 2008}}
{{War in Georgia (2008)}}
As the parliament of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] voted to approve closing the nation's embassy in Moscow and severing diplomatic ties with [[Russia]], officials in the breakaway territory of [[w:South Ossetia|South Ossetia]] are stating that their ultimate goal is not independence, but to be absorbed into Russia.

Znaur Gassiyev, the [[w:Speaker (politics)|speaker]] in the parliament of South Ossetia, said today in [[w:Tskhinvali|Tskhinvali]], the capital, that the region will be annexed by Russia "in several years" or earlier. He further went on that this was the position of Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and South Ossetian leader [[w:Eduard Kokoity|Eduard Kokoity]], who met earlier this week to discuss the future of South Ossetia. Ultimately, South Ossetia would be joined with the Russian federal subject of [[w:North Ossetia-Alania|North Ossetia-Alania]].
[[Image:Caucasus-ethnic en.svg|thumb|left|Ethnic map of the [[w:Caucasus|Caucasus]] region. {{Image source|[[Commons:User:Pmx|Pmx]]}}]]
"We will live in one united Russian state," Tarzan Kokoiti, one of Gassiyev's deputies, said. However, a Russian government spokesperson said there was "no official information" on the talks.

The Vice Speaker of the Georgian Parliament, [[w:Gigi Tsereteli|Gigi Tsereteli]], warned the areas, which are "autonomous republics" within Georgia, that absorption into Russia would ultimately destroy them as territorial entities.

"The regimes of Abkhazia and South Ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of Russia, they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear," Tsereteli said.

On August 26, Russia voted to diplomatically recognize South Ossetia, as well as other another semi-autonomous region of Georgia, [[w:Abkhazia|Abkhazia]]. So far, no other member of the [[United Nations]] has recognized these republics.

"We found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country, then recognizing part of its territories, is trying to create a sense of normalcy," Georgian Foreign Minister [[w:Ekaterine Tkeshelashvili|Ekaterine Tkeshelashvili]] said while in [[Sweden]].

"Breaking off diplomatic relations with Tbilisi is not Moscow's choice, and the responsibility lies with Tbilisi," Andrei Nesterenko, a spokesperson for the [[w:Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Foreign Ministry]], said.

Russia's efforts to get other nations to recognize South Ossetia and [[w:Abkhazia|Abkhazia]] as independent states hit a snag when the [[People's Republic of China]] and other members of the [[w:Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] balked at recognition.

[[Hugo Chávez]], the president of [[Venezuela]], said that he supports the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but did not say if Venezuela formally recognises the republics.

"Russia has recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. We support Russia. Russia is right and is defending its interests," Chavez said.

Russia and South Ossetia continue to work on an agreement to install permanent Russian military bases in the breakaway territory.  The agreement is scheduled to be signed on September 2.

Russian military forces continue to occupy nominal Georgian territory in defiance of the [[European Union]]-brokered ceasefire agreement.

Russian troops advance into Georgia, violating truce
{{date|August 14, 2008}}
{{War in South Ossetia (2008)}}According to Georgian officials and scattered news reports, [[Russia|Russian]] soldiers and [[w:South Ossetia|South Ossetian paramilitaries]] have marched into the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] city of [[w:Gori|Gori]]. This comes one day after a truce was made by both nations to put an end to the six-day war that has killed many and uprooted thousands. 

[[Image:Gori_cathedral_(view_from_the_Gori_Fortress).jpg|thumb|left|170px|Gori, as viewed from the Gori Fortress.]]
"Russia has treacherously broken its word," said Georgia's Security Council chief [[w:Alexandre Lomaia|Alexandre Lomaia]]. Georgian officials also said that Gori was looted and bombed by the Russians, though the latter denies this claim. 

An [[w:Associated Press|Associated Press]] (AP) reporter witnessed dozens of tanks and military vehicles leaving Gori in a southeast direction. One Russian soldier jokingly said to a photographer, "Come with us, beauty, we're going to Tbilisi!" [[w:Tbilisi|Tbilisi]] is the capital of Georgia.

A [[w:CNN|CNN]] crew observed thousands of Georgian troops packing up and leaving Gori at high speed. Georgia has said it was recalling the troops to defend Tbilisi. According to the AP, a [[w:BBC|BBC]] reporter witnessed Russian tanks in the streets of Gori, while South Ossetians were seizing Georgian cars and looting homes.

[[w:Georgian President|Georgian President]] [[w:Mikhail Saakashvili|Mikhail Saakashvili]] has stated that he thinks the Western response to this situation has been inadequate. "I feel that they are partly to blame," he said. "Not only those who commit atrocities are responsible ... but so are those that fail to react."

A Russian ministry of defence official told [[w:Interfax|Interfax]] that Russian troops were in [[w:Senaki|Senaki]] to "prevent attacks by Georgian military units against South Ossetia."

"To begin to repair the damage to its relations with the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world, Russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis," US president [[George W. Bush]] said.

[[w:Sergey Lavrov|Sergey Lavrov]], Russia's Foreign Affairs Minister, responded to the US statement by calling Georgia "a special project of the United States. And we understand that the United States is worried about its project."

At the [[United Nations]], Russian ambassador [[w:Vitaly Churkin|Vitaly Churkin]] said Russia would not sign a [[France|French]]-drafted cease-fire resolution. "We will look at the draft and try to bring it to a standard where it can play a role in this," Churkin said.

UN aid plane crash kills 17 in Democratic Republic of the Congo
{{date|September 3, 2008}}

{{Audio|EN-UN aid plane crash kills 17 in Democratic Republic of the Congo.ogg|2008-03-09}}
A [[United Nations]] (UN) aid plane in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) has crashed, killing all seventeen passengers on board. According to a spokesperson for the organisation "The plane was found 15 kilometres (eight miles) northwest of [[w:Bukavu airport|Bukavu airport]]. There were 15 passengers and two crew on board."

[[w:Air Serv International|Air Serv International]], the operator of the aircraft, said that it did not believe there to be any survivors.  They also said in the statement that "the staff of Air Serv International express their condolences and deepest sympathy to the families of the passengers and crew."

The UN has identified the victims as a [[Canada|Canadian]] member of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), an [[India]]n who worked for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid, two members of [[w:Medecins Sans Frontiers|Medecins Sans Frontiers]], one from [[France]] and one from the [[Republic of Congo]].

The other thirteen were citizens of the DRC. Two were employees of Air Serv and were the crew. Four were with the UNDP and another four were [[w:civil service|civil servants]], while the last three worked for [[w:Handicap International|Handicap International]]. 

The UN spokesperson also said that "the helicopter landed far away [from the wreckage] and the search and rescue team headed to the site on foot."

The plane was on a journey from [[w:Kinshasa|Kinshasa]] to [[w:Goma|Goma]], with stops at [[w:Mbandaka|Mbandaka]], Kisangani and [[w:Bukavu|Bukavu]].

Air crashes are common in the DRC and, as a result, Congolese airliners are banned from flying in the airspace of countries in the [[European Union]].

UN scientist: Eat less meat to tackle climate change
{{date|September 7, 2008}}
{{United Nations}}
[[Image:Rajendra Pachauri - WEF 2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Rajendra Pachauri: "Give up meat for one day initially, and decrease it from there" {{image credit|Remy Steinegger}}]][[w:Rajendra Pachauri|Rajendra Pachauri]], the chair of the UN-run [[w:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has said that eating less [[w:meat|meat]] is a good way to reduce damage to the climate.

Pachuari said that "the [[w:UN Food and Agriculture Organization|UN Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) has estimated that direct emissions from meat production account for about 18% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions," when explaining the reasons behind his comment. "So I want to highlight the fact that among options for mitigating climate change, changing diets is something one should consider." 

"In terms of immediacy of action and the feasibility of bringing about reductions in a short period of time, it [giving up meat] clearly is the most attractive opportunity," continued the climate scientist. "Give up meat for one day [a week] initially, and decrease it from there."

Joyce D'Silva, a spokesperson for [[w:Compassion in World Farming|Compassion in World Farming]] agreed with Pachuari. "Surveys show people are anxious about their personal carbon footprints and cutting back on car journeys and so on; but they may not realize that changing what's on their plate could have an even bigger effect," she said in response to the comments made by the UN climate scientist.

The [[w:National Farmers Union (England and Wales)|National Farmers Union]]  said that people should find ways of environmental farming instead of giving up meat. "The NFU is committed to ensuring farming is part of the solution to climate change, rather than being part of the problem," said a spokesperson for the organization. "We strongly support research aimed at reducing methane emissions from livestock farming by, for example, changing diets and using anaerobic digestion."

United Nations requests US$700 million in aid for East Africa to avoid famine
{{date|September 20, 2008}}{{Audio box|filename=En-United_Nations_requests_US$700_million_in_aid_for_East_Africa_to_avoid_famine.ogg|date=insert date}}
{{United Nations}}
The [[United Nations]] has called for wealthy donor nations to donate [[w:United States Dollar|US$]]700 million ([[w:Pound sterling|£]]382 million or [[w:Euro|&euro;]]484 million) in emergency aid for Eastern [[Africa]] to prevent widespread famine. Since the start of 2008 the number of people living in hunger in the region has almost doubled to seventeen million, according to the UN.

UN emergency relief co-ordinator [[w:John Holmes (British diplomat)|John Holmes]] states that food levels are dangerously low in much of [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]], [[Eritrea]], Northern [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]]. The area, known as the '[[w:Horn of Africa|Horn of Africa]]', has seen drought, war and high food prices all worsen the situation. Holmes has warned that the levels of those in need could rise still further.

A total of $1.4 billion is to be raised for the period from now to the year's end, but at least $716 million of that remains to be found. "We may need significant funds after that period - this is not the end of the story," warned Holmes.

"We can avoid the situations of the 1980s and the 1990s which were genuine famines at different times. But we do need extra resources, very quickly indeed if we are going to avoid going back to famine situations," he said. He says Ethiopia and Somalia are in the worst states, with six million Ethiopians requiring emergency support and 43% of Somalia's population in a similar predicament.

He described locals saying that the situation has never been as bad since 1928, when vast amounts of livestock died. They say rain is needed within the next few months if there is to be any grazing and cereal crops are impossible in the near future, it being well into 2009 before anything may be ready to harvest.

The number of hungry people in the world rose by 75 million last year to 925 million. The [[w:UN Food and Agriculture Organisation|UN Food and Agriculture Organisation]] says high food prices are to blame for the crisis.

Economic opportunities for women still lagging: World Bank and OECD
{{date|September 24, 2008}}
{{Publish}}
{{Economy and business}}
In a recent study released by the [[w:World Bank|World Bank]] and the [[w:Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD), economic opportunities for women are still lagging behind opportunities for men in the [[w:developing world|developing world]]. Improvements have been made in women health and education, according to the study. 
[[Image:A mother with her child in a village in Malawi.jpg|thumb|left|It is estimated that $13 billion a year will be needed to improve economic opportunities for women]]
The study calls for investments totaling over US$13 billion a year to achieve gender equality and women empowerment.

Danny Leipziger, World Bank Vice President for Poverty Reduction and Economic Management, said, "gender equality is key for poverty reduction and growth. Progress on women’s education is essential but not enough if we don’t improve women’s access to good jobs and credit lines, to land ownership and to income-generating activities." 

The study ''Equality for Women: Where Do We Stand on Millennium Development Goal 3?'' looks at the achievements made by the developing world as laid out by the [[w:Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals]] (MD).  These goals are eight [[w:international development|international development]] goals that 189 [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] member states and at least 23 international organizations have agreed to achieve by the year 2015. They include halving extreme poverty, reducing child mortality rates, fighting disease epidemics such as AIDS, and developing a global partnership for development.

Education has improved in 82 countries out of 122 and are on track to meet their MD goals. However, 19 countries, 13 of which are in Sub- Saharan Africa, are seriously off track to meet their target. 

The United Nations will hold a conference on Thursday at the annual session of the UN in New York to discuss the Millennium Development Goals.

UN inspectors banned from North Korean nuclear facility
{{date|September 25, 2008}}
[[Image:Yongbyon 5MWe Magnox reactor.jpg|right|thumb|170px|The Yongbyon nuclear facility. {{image credit|1=Keith Luse}}]]
[[North Korea]] has banned nuclear inspectors from the [[United Nations]] [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) from inspecting its nuclear facility, the {{w|Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center}}. This comes after N. Korean officials said the facility would begin to reprocess plutonium which could begin in as little as a week.

"From here on, the IAEA inspectors will have no further access to the reprocessing plant," said the U.N. in a statement on its website.

"The DPRK has also informed the IAEA inspectors that they plan to introduce nuclear material to the reprocessing plant in one week's time," added the statement. The U.N. finished removing their security seals and surveillance equipment from the plant on Thursday.

{{w|Condoleezza Rice}}, the U.S. Secretary of State, has urged N. Korea to dismantle their facility and return to six-party talks, but {{w|Pyongyang}} has refused and no new talks are scheduled to take place.

"We strongly urge the North to reconsider these steps and come back immediately into compliance with its obligations," said Rice, referring to an agreement reached during the last round of six-party talks.

N. Korea restarted its nuclear program when the U.S. failed to follow through with its agreement to take North Korea off the national list of state-sponsored terrorism supporters.

Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Martti Ahtisaari, Finnish top diplomat
{{date|October 10, 2008}}
{{Audio box 2|filename=En-Nobel_Peace_Prize_awarded_to_Martti_Ahtisaari_Finnish_top_diplomat.ogg‎|date=2008-10-11}}
[[Image:Martti Ahtisaari.jpg|thumb|Martti Ahtisaari served as president of Finland for six years. ]]
The Nobel Peace Committee announced that [[w:Martti Ahtisaari|Martti Ahtisaari]], former president and [[Finland|Finnish]] diplomat, has received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for 2008. 

Norway's Nobel committee praised Martti Ahtisaari for his efforts to help secure peace in a number of conflict torn countries during his lengthy career as a [[United Nations]] diplomat, Finnish president and later, peace activist with his organization, the [[w:Crisis Management Initiative|Crisis Management Initiative]].

Over the past 20 years, the Nobel statement said, Ahtisaari has played a prominent role in resolving serious and long-lasting conflicts in [[Namibia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Iraq]] - among other areas.

In an interview on [[Norway|Norwegian]] television, Ahtisaari cited peace talks in 1989-1990 in the southwestern African nation of Namibia as his greatest achievement. Those talks helped pave the way for Namibia's independence from [[South Africa]].

Ahtisaari began his career as a school teacher before joining Finland's foreign ministry. He served as a United Nations undersecretary and secretary of state for the Finnish foreign ministry before being elected president of Finland in 1994.

Ahtisaari founded the [[w:Crisis Management Initiative|Crisis Management Initiative]] in 2000. The [[w:Helsinki|Helsinki]]-based non-profit organization provides solutions for ending conflicts around the world.

Former [[United States]] Vice-President [[w:Al Gore|Al Gore]] won last year's Nobel peace prize along with the U.N. panel on [[climate change]] for their work on raising attention to the threat of global warming. 

Prior to the announcement [[China|Chinese]] human rights activists were high on the lists of speculations about the prospective receivers. Norwegian lawyer, author and activist, [[w:Fredrik Heffermehl|Fredrik Heffermehl]] published a book criticising the interpretation of the will of Nobel, just a few days prior to October 10. His interpretation is that human rights activists do not fall within the scope of the prize. Even peace mediators fall on the very edge, if the intentions of Alfred Nobel are to be taken seriously. Heffermehl points to former [[w:United States|United States]] senator [[w:Sam Nunn|Sam Nunn]] as a long-term and 2008 nominee to the Nobel Peace Prize, that has worked much more clearly in line with the will of Nobel. Sam Nunn is an activist for disarmament of Soviets arsenals left in [[Russia]].

Some commentators of the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize, criticise the Committee, for not daring to stand up to the Chinese. The [[Denmark|Danish]] peace researcher Øberg, however criticises the choice of Ahtisaari, the recipient of the prize for 2008, because of his role in the Balkans, claiming that the work of Ahtisaari added to hostilities there, instead of  reducing them. Furthermore Øberg, says the Nobel Peace Committee is not comprised of experts in the relevant field, unlike the committees for the scientific prizes.

Djibouti says war with Eritrea is inevitable unless UN intervenes
{{date|October 25, 2008}}
{{Politics and conflicts}}
[[Djibouti]] and [[Eritrea]] have spoken to the [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council|security council]] on Thursday to discuss a border dispute. Djibouti has said that unless the UN intervenes there will be war. 

The dispute dates back to June when violence erupted between the nations in the border region of {{w|Doumeira}}. The resulting clashes killed an estimated 35 people.  The unmarked border remains disputed, and the nations have built up troops on each side of the border, keeping the situation tense.

Djibouti's ambassador to the UN, Roble Olhaye, has accused Eritrea of avoiding mediation on the problem. Djibouti's President {{w|Omah Guelleh}} told the UN security council "Continued inaction in whatever form not only will encourage but will benefit Eritrea's attitude. This would only give my country one option, the option of war." 

The Eritrean ambassador to the UN, Araya Desta, claimed to have peaceful intentions and that his nation had no wishes to take new territory. He claimed his country desired "the cultivation of good neighbourly relations with Djibouti," and said that "Contrary to the claims made, Eritrea has not taken any land that belongs to Djibouti and it does not have any territorial ambitions."

Desta accused [[Ethiopia]] of worsening the situation by preparing military forces to help Djibouti. "Ethiopia has built from the Djiboutian side a network of winding roads up the mount and deployed offensive long-range artillery and heavy equipment directed at Eritrea," he said. Olhaye dismissed the idea of Ethiopia's involvement with the claim "Whatever the Eritrean ambassador has said is hogwash." 

The UN security council has urged both nations to show restraint; it was the UN who called on the nations to agree to a ceasefire in June.

Syria files UN Security Council complaint after US raid
{{date|October 30, 2008}}
{{Politics and conflicts}}In the aftermath of a [[United States]] {{w|2008 Abu Kamal raid|raid in border town Abu Kamal}} within [[Syria]] on October 26, the country has filed a complaint with the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] to prevent further breaches of Syria's borders. Calling the operation a "terrorist aggression," Syria has alleged that eight civilians were killed in the raid, which was launched from neighboring [[Iraq]].

"Syria draws attention to this aggressive act and expects the UN Security Council and member countries to assume their responsibility by preventing a repetition of this dangerous violation," read a letter to the UN Security Council. It called for the UN "to hold the aggressor responsible for the deaths of the innocent Syrian nationals."
[[Image:Al-qaim-area.svg|thumb|left|Map showing location of {{w|Abu Kamal}} and the border area along the {{w|Euphrates}}.]]
In a press briefing on Tuesday, {{w|James K. Glassman}}, the {{w|Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs}}, refused to comment on the raid. The {{w|United States Department of State}} (DoS) has issued no official comment.

However, a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told {{w|Reuters}} that the raid was targeting {{w|Al-Qaeda in Iraq}} lieutenant Abu Ghadiya.

"It was a successful operation," said the official. "He [Abu Ghadiya] is believed to be dead. This undoubtedly will have a debilitating effect on this foreign fighter smuggling network."

A second US government source told Reuters that no women or children were killed. Yet, Syria has claimed that three children were killed.

The Syrian government said it has ordered the closure of an educational facility known as the Damascus Community School and the American Culture Center in response to the raid. The school serves foreign students in Syria's capital, {{w|Damascus}}, and is less than 200 feet from the US embassy. As of Wednesday, {{w|Agence France-Presse}} is reporting both facilities as still open.
{{QuoteLeft|Syria is awaiting official explanations from the US and Iraqi governments on this unacceptable violation of Syrian sovereignty|4=Faisal Meqdad}}
"We expect the Syrian government to provide adequate security for the buildings in which the American Cultural Center and Damascus Community School are housed," said DoS spokesperson Robert Wood.

The United States has long claimed that Syria is not doing enough to secure its borders with Iraq and that foreign fighters are joining the insurgency in Iraq through routes along this border.

Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said, Iraq objects to its land being used for attacks on other countries but hopes Syria will become more vigilant against certain groups.

"Syria is awaiting official explanations from the US and Iraqi governments on this unacceptable violation of Syrian sovereignty before taking additional measures," said Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister {{w|Faisal Meqdad}}.

The United States Embassy in Syria has posted a notice that it will close its doors on Thursday "due to security concerns."

Synchronised bombings strike Indian state of Assam
{{date|October 31, 2008}}
{{India}}[[Image:IndiaAssam.png|thumb|left|Map of India, Assam highlighted in purple]]
At least thirteen bombs were set off in the northeastern state of [[w:Assam|Assam]] in [[India]] on Thursday. The blasts went off shortly before noon [[w:Indian Standard Time|IST]] ([[w:UTC+5:30|UTC+5:30]]) at market places and government buildings in the state capital [[w:Guwahati|Guwahati]] and surrounding area.

Reports say that so far 77 people have been confirmed killed and between 200 and 300 injured. 41 of the victims were in Guwahati, 21 in [[w:Kokrajhar|Kokrajhar]] and 15 in [[w:Barpeta|Barpeta]].

Assam has been the scene of separatist insurgencies for years, most notably by [[w:United Liberation Front of Assam|United Liberation Front of Assam]] (ULFA) which was outlawed by the Indian government in 1990. The [[w:Associated Press|Associated Press]] says over 10,000 people have died in separatist violence in the past decade.

The ULFA has denied any involvement, reported the [[w:Press Trust of India|Press Trust of India]]. Instead, a previously unheard of group, calling itself Islamic Security Force-Indian Mujahideen (ISF-IM) claimed responsibility in a text message to a television station. The message included a warning of future attacks.

Later, people who were apparently upset about the bombings, started rioting in the streets of Guwahati and throwing stones at vehicles. They also torched at least two fire engines. Police shut down roads and implemented a curfew in response to the unrest.

[[w:Shakeel Ahmad|Shakeel Ahmad]] of the [[w:Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] said conditions in Assam were "very volatile, the government was on high alert and, even then, this has happened."

In the past, the government has blamed similar attacks on [[w:Islamic|Islamic]] militants based in nearby [[w:Bangladesh|Bangladesh]].

[[Ban Ki-moon]], the secretary-general of the [[United Nations]] condemned the attack in a statement.

Ban conveyed "sorrow and sympathy to the Government and people of India for the loss of life and destruction caused by today's series of bombings," in the statement which was released on Thursday.

Dozens dead after school collapses in Haiti
{{date|November 7, 2008}}
{{Haiti}}At least 50 people are dead, mostly children, and an unknown amount injured and trapped after a three-story school collapsed near the capital of [[Haiti]], {{w|Port-au-Prince}}. So far, rescuers have rescued at least 75 people, who have been taken to a local hospital, some in serious condition. School was in session, which left dozens more trapped, and officials say the death toll is likely to climb. Five houses surrounding the school were also severely damaged or destroyed as a result of the collapse.

Reports say that the third-floor of the College La Promesse Evangelique in {{w|Pétionville}}, was under construction when the collapse happened, but it is not known if that was the cause. The collapse occurred at 10:00 a.m. local time.

"The whole school collapsed on the kids, and you know on the phone you can hear so many, so many children, you know, crying, crying. And saying, 'This one is dead, that one is dead'," said Michaele Gedeon, a worker with the Haitian [[w:International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to ''{{w|CNN}}''. 

Gedeon also states that hundreds of people; rescue workers, bystanders, [[United States]] officials and [[United Nations]] peacekeepers along with the Red Cross were on scene sifting through the debris, using their hands and shovels, trying to find survivors.

"UN blue helmets are on the scene clearing rubble and trying to help people buried under the debris. If we can’t get rescue equipment in and out it’s going to be hard to help the people trapped in the building," said a spokesman for the U.N. in Haiti, David Wimhurst.

At least 700 children attend the school, ranging from kindergarten to secondary grades, with the students' ages ranging from 3 to 20-years-old.

The school is reported to have partially collapsed eight years ago, and residents living near it moved in fear that the rest of it would collapse on their homes. After the first collapse, the owner of the school attempted to buy the homes and properties surrounding the school.

Witnesses and residents fear that the school was improperly repaired after the first collapse. Police are investigating the two incidents to determine if criminal charges will be filed.

UN reports condemn West Bank settlement
{{Palestine}}
{{date|November 21 2008}}
Speaking before the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] summarized two reports conducted by the [[United Nations|UN]] concluding that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and other territories is illegal and "a breach of the fourth {{w|Geneva Convention}}."  This is not the first time that the UN has condemned Israeli breach of the convention, but this comes at a crucial time when Israeli blockades of the {{w|Gaza Strip}}, according to Al Jazeera and Democracy Now, are endangering approximately 750,000 Gazans who rely on UN and Israeli food aid for survival.

The statement by Ban Ki-Moon was made after the reissue of two reports condemning Israeli occupation, "The advisory opinion and a number of United Nations resolutions have all affirmed that Israel's practice of constructing settlements—in effect, the transfer by an occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies —constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention," reads the first report: Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem, and the occupied Syrian Golan.  "In addition to the construction of the settlements, other activities related to settlements are also illegal. "These include the requisition of land, the destruction of houses and orchards, the construction of roads meant for the use of settlers only, the exploitation of natural resources within the occupied territory and the alteration of the character and status of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The international community has also raised concerns regarding the depletion of natural resources as a result of settlements," the report continues.

==Israeli Blockade of the Gaza Strip==
According to [[Al Jazeera]] and other news sources, Israel has sealed off access to the Gaza Strip for  aid workers and journalists since early November because of Palestinian rocket fire eminating from the area.  750,000 Gazans are without food or power at the moment, and some Palestinians see this as a violation of the shaky truce brokered in July of this year.  Jacky Rowland, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Jerusalem, said: "The ceasefire doesn't seem to be anything more than a name at this stage."  On November 17th, Israel allowed some UN food aid to pass through its barricades.  

Top UN official Jon Ging spoke about the situation, saying: "These people have been reduced to be dependent on this food, and now we can’t even get that food into Gaza. It’s a disaster."

In addition to disallowing food access, Israel has also barred foreign journalists from entering the area.

According to Democracy Now, on Tuesday, November 20th, executives from the Associated Press, Reuters, New York Times, BBC, CNN, and other news sources sent a letter to the government of Israel condemning the government's choice to bar foreign journalists from the Gaza Strip saying, "We are gravely concerned about the prolonged and unprecedented denial of access to the Gaza Strip for the international media.” Israel defended themselves by criticizing the media and accusing them of not properly pointing out the reasoning behind the blockade of the Gaza Strip.

UN to deploy over 3000 more troops to Congo
{{date|November 20, 2008}}
{{United Nations}}
The [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] has announced that it intends to send up to 3,085 more peacekeeping troops to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], despite a commitment from rebel forces to reduce their fighting.

The UN stated that the troops will be deployed immediately, and kept in the Congo for at least the rest of 2008. 

Depending on the security situation in the country, the troops may be kept in the country past the end of this year.

The move was made as part of UN Security Council [[s:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1843|Resolution 1843]], and was recommended by the United Nations Secretary-General, [[Ban Ki-moon]].

The resolution states that this “temporary increase in personnel aims at enabling {{w|MONUC}} to reinforce its capacity to protect civilians, to reconfigure its structure and forces and to optimize their deployment.”
[[Image:United Nations Security Council.jpg|thumb|left|The UN Security Council chamber, which is located in New York {{image credit|Patrick Gruban}}]]
The resolution also made some other comments in relation to the Congo. The resolution also aimed to work at “reiterating its condemnation of the resurgence of violence in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and demanding all parties to immediately respect a ceasefire.”

The document also welcomed “the appointment of former Nigerian President {{w|Olusegun Obasanjo}} by the Secretary-General as his Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region.

UN official: Gaza faces humanitarian catastrophe
{{date|November 24, 2008}}
{{Palestine}}Although [[Israel]] briefly lifted its blockade of crossings in the [[w:Gaza Strip|Gaza Strip]] today, [[United Nations]] (UN) officials warn that a further blockade could lead to dire consequences for some 750,000 Gazans who rely on UN food aid. Israel blockaded the Gaza Strip in early November, preventing access for UN aid workers and journalists.

The border crossing was opened to allow some food aid and medical supplies through, however, [[w:UNRWA|United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) spokesman Christopher Gunness warned that "it is just not enough."
[[Image:Gaza conflict map.png|thumb|left|Map showing location of the Gaza Strip]]
The UNRWA also warns that Gaza faces "a humanitarian catastrophe."  Karen Abu Zayd, commissioner general of UNRWA, said the death toll since the beginning of the Israeli blockade is the gravest since the early days of the Palestinian intifada eight years ago. The Israeli blockade has shut down power for the Gaza Strip, and patients at local hospitals are in grave risk of death because of faulty generators.

"Almost every part of the intensive care unit runs on electricity which comes from Gaza's main power plant [...] that plant is run on fuel from Israel, but no supplies have reached the plant for well over a week now," said [[w:Al Jazeera|Al Jazeera]]'s correspondent in Gaza.

Israel closed the Gaza Strip on November 5 because of rocket fire emanating from the area after the Israeli army units entered and carried out an operation against members of the Hamas combat wing. Currently all foreign journalists are banned from entering Gaza. AP, Reuters, the New York Times, the BBC, CNN and other major news organizations have protested the blockade.

International community marks the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People
{{date|December 02, 2008}}
{{Palestine}}
[[Image:Palestinian_children_in_Jenin.jpg|thumb|left|Palestinian children]]
November 29 marked the [[United Nations]] [[w:International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People|International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People]] and the anniversary of the 1947 Resolution 181, which partitioned [[Palestine]] into two states – [[w:Jewish|Jewish]] and [[w:Arab|Arab]]. Events have been held throughout the week including a non-violent Palestinian demonstration held in [[w:Bethlehem|Bethlehem]] on Thursday, the screening of a film, "Voice from the Heart of Gaza" by ''Popular Committee against the Siege'' and photo exhibits at the Al Shawa Cultural Center and the [[United Nations]]. 

On November 24, U.N. Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] said, "The Palestinians have been deprived of their inalienable rights, including the right to self-determination and statehood, for more than 60 years.  Israelis live with an ever-present sense of insecurity. There is only one way to address such legitimate rights and fears: a peace agreement that results in an end of occupation, an end of conflict, and the creation of a State of Palestine living side-by-side in peace with the State of Israel". 

The [[Israel]]i newspaper ''[[w:Haaretz|Haaretz]]'' had warned of a concerted diplomatic attack against Israel at the [[w:United Nations General Assembly|United Nations General Assembly]]. The Israeli Ambassador [[w:Gabriela Shalev|Gabriela Shalev]] said the UN is disconnected from reality and "does not represent or reflect what is truly happening" at a time when Israel is engaged in peace talks with the Palestinian Authority. The UN General Assembly President, Father Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua, called for an international boycott of Israel and accused it of being an apartheid regime. The European Jewish Congress (EJC) denounced "anti-Semitic and anti-Israel remarks" made by Father Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann and called for his resignation.

|}

Dmitry Medvedev, the president of [[Russia]] said, “I want to reiterate the Russian Federation’s principled position of support for the Palestinian people and their legitimate national aspirations, including the right to establish an independent and viable Palestinian state. It is my conviction that the restoration of state sovereignty would contribute to stability in the region and the safe coexistence and conflict-free mutually beneficial cooperation of all countries and peoples. We support your commitment to peaceful dialogue in the aim of finding a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and finding mutually acceptable solutions based on universally recognized international law. Restoration of intra-Palestinian unity remains an important condition for achieving these aims".

[[China|Chinese]] Premier Wen Jiabao sent a congratulatory message to the UN meeting on Tuesday which said, "To resolve the Palestinian issue at an early date is the aspiration of the people in the Mideast as well as the common expectation of the international community. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China will continue to support the United Nations in playing an important role in solving the Mideast problem and pushing forward the settlement of the Palestinian issue".

Gaza has had twenty-three days of complete closure and undergone a 18-month siege which has lead regional and international organizations to warn of a humanitarian catastrophe.

===Standoff in Mumbai enters third day===
[[Image:26 November 2008 Mumbai attacks locations.png|thumb|140px|Detail map showing the eight attack sites in Mumbai]]
The battle between the Indian security forces and terrorists which have taken over various targets across the city of Mumbai has entered the third day as the Indian security forces work to clear out and rescue remaining hostages as the death toll continues to rise.

Indian forces stormed the Oberoi Trident hotel, freeing over 200 hostages there. However, reports say that 24 to 30 hostages were still killed there. Meanwhile, Indian commandos also entered the Mumbai Chabad house, where they discovered the bodies of 5 hostages.

The last area of fighting that remains is at the historic Taj Mahal Palace & Tower hotel, where gunfire and explosions have been reported.

Number of Zimbabwe cholera deaths nears 500
{{date|December 2, 2008}}
{{Zimbabwe}}A [[w:Cholera|cholera]] outbreak in the African country of [[Zimbabwe]] has killed almost 500 people since August, according to the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO). The WHO said that the outbreak affected most areas of the country, and that some remote areas had seen fatality rates increase by as much as 30%. Zimbabwe's Ministry of Health reported 484 deaths from 11,735 cases since the outbreak began.

Zimbabwe has had annual outbreaks of cholera for nearly a decade, but this one was the most far-reaching. A report by the WHO stated that the last large outbreak was in 1992, with 3,000 cases recorded.
[[Image:Distribution of the cholera.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Map showing nations that are affected by cholera.]]
Cholera is frequently spread by contaminated, untreated water. The spread of the disease was expedited by the collapse of Zimbabwe's health and sanitation systems; state media reported that most of [[w:Harare|Harare]] has been left without water after the city ran out of chemicals for its treatment plant. A resident of Mabvuku, a suburb located east of Harare, told APTV that electricity is not available most of the time, so water is consumed without being boiled first.

The medical charity [[w:Médecins Sans Frontières|Médecins Sans Frontières]] (Doctors Without Borders) said that there have been cases of cholera reported in areas of [[Botswana]], [[Mozambique]], and [[South Africa]] that border Zimbabwe, indicating the sub-regional threat of the outbreak. The South African ministry of health confirmed that they had 160 incidents of cholera reported, as well as three deaths.

The [[w:European Commission|European Commission]] said that it was providing [[w:Euro|€]]9 million ([[w:United Stated dollar|US$]]11.4 million) in funds to assist Zimbabwe with the crisis. "I'm shocked at the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and call upon the authorities there to respond quickly to this cholera outbreak by allowing full assistance from international humanitarians and regional partners," said the commissioner responsible for the European Union's humanitarian aid, Louis Michel.

Other agencies providing aid to the country include the [[w:United Nations Children's Fund|United Nations Children's Fund]], the WHO, and Doctors Without Borders.

Solar car travels around the world
{{date|December 5, 2008}}

On December 4, 2008, a solar car, developed by scientists at [[Switzerland|Swiss]] universities, ended its journey of traveling around the world at the [[United Nations]] climate talks in Poznań, [[Poland]]. [[w:Yvo de Boer|Yvo de Boer]], the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, rode into Poznań in the vehicle, along with schoolteacher Louis Palmer.
{{HYS question right|Will solar-powered cars become viable in the near future?}}
The two-seat car began its journey 17 months ago in Lucerne, Switzerland. Carrying solar cells on a trailer, the car sent the message that global warming can be stopped and there are better alternatives.

"This is the first time in history that a solar-powered car has travelled all the way around the world without using a single drop of petrol," said Palmer. "These new technologies are ready. It's ecological, it's economical, it is absolutely reliable. We can stop global warming."
{{QuoteLeft|It's ecological, it's economical, it is absolutely reliable. We can stop global warming.|4=Louis Palmer}}
Many people have been carried by the solar car, including New York City Mayor [[w:Michael Bloomberg|Michael Bloomberg]] and UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]].

The conference in Poznań seeks to draft a new climate treaty that would replace the [[w:Kyoto protocol|Kyoto protocol]], which is set to expire in 2012. The delegates hope to finalize the treaty by December 2009, when the UN reconvenes on the climate in [[w:Copenhagen|Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].

"Here at the conference, we are talking about reducing emissions by 10 or 20 percent," Palmer said. "I want to show that we can reduce emissions by 100 percent — and that's what we need for the future."

"Bali Roadmap" agreed on, applauded
{{Correction|date=December 15|explanation=In an earlier version of this article it was incorrectly stated that Pakistan in the midday session restated its position that a paragraph needed to be rephrased. It was in fact India that restated this position.}}
{{date|December 15, 2007}}

After the [[United States]] agreed to the changes proposed by [[India]] this morning, the so called ''Bali Roadmap'' has been agreed on, to applause from all parties. The decision was made at this year's [[w:2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Bali. The Roadmap establishes a time frame and scope for reaching a post-2012 climate change agreement. This includes setting, for industrialized nations, targets for reductions of [[w:greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions. Numerous observers and parties had voiced that they see this as being of great importance prior to and during the conference.

Following the reopening of the plenary at midday, India reiterated its position that part of a paragraph needed to be reformulated. The [[European Union|EU]] went on to state that in the spirit of negotiations, they agreed with the proposed changes. After some further statements by other nations, the US said that they can not accept the changes, as they would considerably change the balance of the text. This was met with loudly audible booing in the plenary. Some time later, after a number of other nations voiced their opinions and the American delegation could be seen busily debating and writing, the US said they would agree to the consensus position after all. Standing ovations and cheers welcomed this change in position, which allowed the President of the Conference soon thereafter to declare the document decided.

India this morning had raised objections on one of the central documents of what constitutes the Roadmap. This had made a decision impossible for the time being, as the conference can only pass items unanimously. The objection regarded the phrasing of how nations with developing industries are to take action to slow and reduce their GHG emissions. The President of the Conference, the Indonesian Environmental Minister, had declined the request, stating that the proposal he had made was very finely balanced. The President had then suspended the session so that further consultations could be made.

No progress was made when the meeting was reopened about an hour later, with [[China]] stating that negotiations of the so called Group of 77 and China with the Indonesian Minister of Finance were still ongoing. China then accused the [[w:UNFCCC|UNFCCC]] secretariat of deliberately opening the plenary session at a time it knew that their Ministers were in talks. The Chinese delegate went on to demand an apology by the secretariat, and the meeting was again suspended.

===Yesterday's negotiations===

Ministerial negotiations had continued through the night until the early morning hours yesterday and the climate conference had been scheduled to decide on the last outstanding items this morning.

Yesterday evening Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC had said that the parties were "on the brink of agreement", when he was asked where negotiations currently stand. With almost all open matters having been agreed on by a group of 40 ministers, one of the last outstanding points then was still the question of guideline numbers for GHG cuts.

Some of the issues that had still been open the day before yesterday (for example how [[w:deforestation|deforestation]] was to be addressed and the matter of financial support for developing countries to send and support negotiators to the UN climate conferences), had apparently been addressed to everyones satisfaction during yesterdays informal talks. But the talks were still on with regard to preambular text of a document that states how further action to mitigate climate change is to be taken, the inclusion of a 25-40% range for reductions in GHG emissions for industrialized nations by 2020 from 1990 levels being contested. 

The draft decision proposed by the President of the Conference today however, no longer included the numbers, but did make reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This [[w:IPCC|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year.

UN General Assembly approves measures to protect economic, social and cultural rights
{{date|December 13, 2008}}

{{United Nations}}The [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly}} has adopted a new human rights instrument to protect {{w|economic, social and cultural rights}}.

The {{w|Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights}} was formally adopted by the General Assembly on {{w|Human Rights Day}}, December 10.  The protocol establishes a complaints mechanism to the {{w|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights}}, allowing individuals to complain to an international body about breaches of the Covenant.  Complaints will be heard by the UN's {{w|Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights}}.

The adoption of the optional protocol has been welcomed by human rights groups, with {{w|Amnesty International}} calling it "a historic instrument that secures access to justice for everyone whose economic, social and cultural rights are violated".  Souhayr Belhassen, President of the {{w|International Federation of Human Rights}}, said that the protocol would strengthen human rights.

"As we have seen for other rights, the development of an international complaint mechanism for victims of violations of economic, social and cultural rights will enable the strengthening of redress mechanisms at the national level, and of policies specifically targeted to ensure the realisation of these rights," he said.

A group of 36 UN human rights experts called the protocol "an essential step towards the establishment of a long-awaited mechanism that reinforces the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights".  They called on all states to quickly sign and ratify the protocol.

The optional protocol will now be opened for signature.  It will come into force when ratified by 10 parties.

The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights came into force in 1976 and obliges its parties to protect and progressively implement economic, social, and cultural rights, including labour rights and rights to health, education, and an adequate standard of living. The Covenant has 159 parties.  The United States has signed, but not ratified the Covenant.

Sharp increase in number of Zimbabwean cholera deaths
{{date|December 16, 2008}}
[[Image:Mugabecloseup2008.jpg|thumb|left|220px|President Mugabe declared that the cholera outbreak has been contained]]
{{Zimbabwe}}The [[United Nations]] has reported that a total of 978 people have been killed by a [[w:Cholera|cholera]] epidemic in the [[Africa|African]] nation of [[Zimbabwe]], an increase of 25% from just three days ago. The UN also says that there have been 18,413 reported cases in the country since the epidemic began in August of 2008.

The outbreak of the disease has been quickened by the lack of proper sanitation and the collapse of water systems and healthcare. The area worst affected by cholera is Zimbabwe's capital of [[w:Harare|Harare]], where 208 people died out of 8,454 suspected cases. The town of [[w:Beitbridge|Beitbridge]], which is located on the border with [[South Africa]], has also been hard hit, with 3,546 cases reported and 91 people dead.

The South African [[w:Red Cross|Red Cross]] has sent medical aid to Zimbabwe, and has asked for funds to treat thirty thousand people. The UN says that as many as sixty thousand people could become affected by the disease if no action is taken.

Last Thursday, Zimbabwean president [[Robert Mugabe]] announced in a televised address that the outbreak had been halted, saying that "I am happy to say our doctors are being assisted by others, and the [[w:World Health Organisation|WHO [World Health Organization]]] have now arrested cholera."

Mugabe has also accused Western powers of plotting to use the epidemic as a reason to overthrow him. "Now that there is no cholera, there is no cause for war," he stated. Other Zimbabwean high-ranking officials have also blamed the United Kingdom for spreading cholera on purpose.

The [[w:UN Security Council|UN Security Council]] will have a briefing on the Zimabwean cholera crisis soon.

Somali pirates hijack Indonesian tugboat and Turkish container ship
{{date|December 17, 2008}}
[[image:LocationSomalia.svg|260px|right|thumb|Map showing Somalia]]
Two more vessels have been hijacked in [[Somalia]]. Pirates have captured an [[Indonesia]]n tugboat with a barge that was working for [[France|French]] oil firm [[w:Total S.A.|Total]] and a [[Turkey|Turkish]] container ship.

The Turkish vessel's seizure was confirmed by a [[w:US Fifth Fleet|US Fifth Fleet]] spokesman. MV ''Bosphorus Prodigy'' is a 330 ft (100 m) container vessel flagged in [[Antigua and Barbuda]]. It is owned and operated by Isko Marine Company based in [[w:Istanbul|Istanbul]].

The Fifth Fleet could not confirm the tugboat's seizure, but an anonymous official with Total in [[Yemen]] could. He explained the boat and barge were headed to [[Malaysia]] from the Yemeni port of [[w:Mukalla|Mukalla]]. He said the crew consisted of both Indonesians and other nationalities, and that the vessels, which had been hired by a subcontractor, were not carrying any oil at the time.

The new hijackings came as the [[w:United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] asked for greater policing in the area by international bodies, and for the signing of agreements that allowed the arresting officer to take pirates back to the officer's country for prosecution.

"Pirates cannot be keelhauled or forced to walk the plank, nor should they be dumped off the Somali coast," said the office's head Antonio Maria Costa. "They need to be brought to justice".

International controversy over UN declaration to stop anti-homosexuality legislation
{{date|December 21, 2008}}
{{Politics and conflicts}}The [[United States]] — along with [[Russia]], [[China]], and many [[w:Arabic|Arab]] countries — has stirred up international tensions by refusing to sign a [[United Nations]] declaration that condemns anti-[[w:homosexuality|gay]] laws and demands international decriminalization of homosexuality. 

The historic declaration was crafted in conjunction with the anniversary of the U.N.'s 1948 [[w:Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR). The new motion would extend the rights guaranteed in the UDHR to homosexual and transgender people, 60 years after the original declaration was made. It was backed by France and the Netherlands, and has been signed by sixty-six countries including Mexico, Israel, Australia and Japan. 

The refusal of the U.S. to sign the non-binding declaration was prompted by its own legal questions. Officials said signing the declaration would cause a conflict between state and federal governments because of laws already in place. American military personnel are not allowed to be openly gay, and in some states landlords and employers are allowed to discriminate against a sexual orientation. 

Carolyn Vadino, a spokeswoman for the U.S. mission to the U.N., said the refusal to sign the declaration does not mean the U.S. believes human rights violations related to sexual orientation are acceptable. 

Gay rights activists in the U.S. and around the world, however, expressed anger at the United States' decision, with one international group calling the stance "appalling." Former chief U.S. spokesman to the U.N. Richard Grenell said the United States' reasons for not signing the declaration were "ridiculous," adding that "the U.S. lack of support on this issue only dims our once bright beacon of hope and freedom for those who are persecuted and oppressed."

Representatives around the world have also spoken out against the U.S. decision, and in support of the updated declaration. Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Verhagen said the declaration was purely symbolic but that he would accept nothing less than for "human rights apply to all people in all places at all times." U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay discussed concerns over the countries that have not signed the document, comparing anti-gay laws to Apartheid laws and saying that stigma was to blame for unpunished violence and discrimination.

The declaration has met opposition from several Arab and African countries, which issued a joint statement condemning the attempt at "the social normalization and possibly the legalization of deplorable acts."  One Syrian official said it would lead to more pedophilia.  In many of these countries homosexuality is a criminal offense and, in seven nations, homosexuality carries a death sentence.

The Vatican has rejected the declaration as well, saying it appreciates the efforts made to end the criminal status of gays in many countries but that the declaration "gives rise to uncertainty in the law and challenges existing human rights norms." The vague definitions of 'gender identity' and 'sexual orientation', it said, would undermine existing and future laws.

===Strike on UN school in Gaza kills 40===

[[File:Gaza Strip-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|131px|right|Map of [[w:Gaza Strip|Gaza Strip]].]]

[[Palestine|Palestinian]] medical officials report that a [[United Nations]] school in [[w:Gaza City|Gaza City]], which was being used as a shelter for civilians, took a direct hit from an [[Israel|Israeli]] tank, killing more than 30 Palestinians on the 11<sup>th</sup> day of the [[w:2008–2009_Israel–Gaza_conflict|assault]]. Israeli officials have stated that rocket fire had emerged from within the school. Doctors of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabaliya report that an additional 10 people died at the hospital and they expect an increase in the casualties as more people may be on the way to the hospital.

=== US Government calls for Gaza ceasefire ===
[[File:Rice Olmert Abbas 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Secretary Rice, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007]]
Secretary of State, [[Condoleezza Rice]] is due at a [[United Nations]] Security Council meeting to help bring an end to the Israeli [[w:2008–2009_Israel–Gaza_conflict|assault]]. [[United States]] Government officials say that they would like an immediate and stable ceasefire.

"We would like an immediate ceasefire, absolutely... An immediate ceasefire that is durable, sustainable and not time-limited," said Assistant Secretary of State [[w:Sean McCormack|Sean McCormack]].

The [[Israel]]i Government, however, does not find the "international pressure" high enough to call a ceasefire. Reports also say that [[European Union]] has given a tacit green light to the Israeli assault, because they failed to come against it.

As of today, the total death toll has increased to 600 [[Palestine|Palestinians]] (100 of which are civilians), and 2,700 are wounded.

=== Natural gas crisis hits Austria and Turkey on its 6<sup>th</sup> day ===
[[File:RF_NG_pipestoEU.gif|thumb|150px|left|Primary Russian [[w:Natural gas|gas]] pipelines to Europe.]]
It has been six days since [[Russia]] halted the [[w:Natural gas|natural gas]] flow to [[Ukraine]], and therefore to subsequent countries such as [[Bulgaria]], [[Austria]], [[Turkey]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and [[Hungary]]. The Russian natural gas pipeline is the primary source of natural gas for some countries such as Ukraine, Austria and Turkey.

Ukraine is currently in negotiations with Russia in order to restart the gas flow, however Russia has increased the prices from [[w:United States dollar|US$]]179.50 per 1,000 cubic meters to $250 per 1,000 cubic meters for Ukraine.

Austrian Government officials are planning a meeting due to the 90% decrease in natural gas flow coming from Russia. [[w:OMV|OMV AG]] reports that Austria has a three-month natural gas reserve which would allow them to get by the winter of 2009. Currently, 51% of Austria's natural gas comes from Russia and only 18% of their natural gas is produced locally.

The Turkish Government says that Turkey is more time-limited in this crisis, since they only have 5 days of natural gas reserve left. However in this situation, [[Iran]] has stated that they will increase gas flow to Turkey.

Palestinian president pleads with UN Security Council for help in Gaza
{{date|January 8, 2009}}
{{Palestine}}
[[File:Gz-map.png|border|left|200px]]
[[Palestine|Palestinian]] President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] has urged the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] to call for [[Israel]] to immediately cease aggression in the [[Gaza Strip]]. He also called for the lifting of the "suffocating siege" of Gaza. Israel began ground operations in Gaza on Saturday.

"I call on the council to take the first necessary step to save my people in Gaza: a resolution calling for an immediate full cessation of Israeli aggression," he told the 15-member council. According to medics, the Israeli invasion has cost the lives of 660 Palestinians, 220 of which are children.

"The loss of civilian life in Gaza and Israel is a source of deep concern for me," said [[United States]] President-elect [[Barack Obama]].

Current {{w|United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State}} [[Condoleezza Rice]] has told the Council that the United States is deeply concerned about the "clearly worsening" situation.

"We need very much to find a solution to this problem in the short term," she said. "But it really must be a solution this time that doesn't allow Hamas to use Gaza as launching pad against Israeli cities. It has to be a solution that does not allow the rearmament of Hamas, and it must be a solution that finds a way to open crossings so that Palestinians in Gaza can have normal life."
{{QuoteLeft|In the face of such terrorism we have no choice.|source=Gabriela Shalev, Israel's envoy to the United Nations}}
Meanwhile, [[Egypt]]ian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] has been pushing for an immediate ceasefire.

"[Egypt] invites the Israelis and Palestinians for an urgent meeting to reach arrangements and guarantees that would not allow the repeat of the current escalation," Mr. Mubarak said. Mr. Abbas expressed support for the invitation. Israel is yet to respond.

Israel's envoy to the [[United Nations]], Gabriela Shalev, made no mention of the proposal by Mr. Mubarak in her speech to the Security Council. She stated, however, that the incursion had dealt heavy blows to the infrastructure of Hamas. She reiterated that Israel had no choice in the face of such attacks but to act.

"In the face of such terrorism we have no choice," Ms. Shalev said. "We have to defend ourselves - not from the Palestinian people, but from the terrorists who have taken them hostage."

While denying that there is a crisis in the Gaza Strip, the office of Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] will open what it calls a "humanitarian corridor" into the territory.

"This involves opening up geographical areas for limited periods of time during which the population will be able to receive the aid and stock up," the office said.

International experts probe deadly Ebola Reston virus outbreak in Philippine pigs
{{Philippines}}
{{date|January 8, 2009}}
[[File:Ebola Virus TEM PHIL 1832 lores.jpg|left|thumb|225px|Transmission Electron Micrograph of the {{w|Reston ebolavirus|Ebola Virus}}. {{w|Viral hemorrhagic fever|Hemorrhagic Fever}}, {{w|RNA Virus}}.]]
Global animal and health authorities' emergency mission to the [[Philippines]] is investigating  whether the strain of deadly {{w|Ebola Reston}} virus, recently discovered in dead pigs, poses a threat to human health. Unlike more-deadly strains of Ebola virus, Philippine health officials say this particular strain, known as the {{w|Reston ebolavirus}}, has never caused human illness or death, and it's not immediately clear there is a public-health issue.

A 22-member team of experts from three [[United Nations]] agencies arrived in Manila on Tuesday for a joint risk assessment on the virus contamination of local swine, to help the government contain the outbreak. The mission will coordinate with the Philippine counterparts - the Departments of Agriculture and Health. According to chief veterinary officer, Davinio P. Catbagan, six of 28 swine samples tested positive for Ebola-Reston by the {{w|United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture}} laboratory. The infected pigs came from two commercial and two backyard farms in three provinces north of Manila. Both Ebola and related [[Marburg virus|Marburg hemorrhagic fever]], are considered to infect humans via primates.

The Straits Times reported that as of December, about 6,000 pigs at Pandi, Bulacan and  {{w|Talavera}} farms had tested positive for the Ebola-Reston virus. "Eating pork remained safe as long as it is handled and cooked properly (at a minimum of 70 degrees Celsius or 158 degrees Fahrenheit) and bought in outlets accredited by the government's National Meat Inspection Service," said a joint statement by the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO), {{w|World Organisation for Animal Health}} (OIE) and {{w|Food and Agriculture Organisation}} (FAO). "Our teams are doing field and laboratory investigation to determine where the Ebola-Reston virus came from and how it was transmitted," Caroline-Anne Coulombe, WHO risk communications officer, explained.

According to FAO team leader, Juan Lubroth, it was the first time that the Ebola-Reston virus strain had infected animals other than monkeys and the first recorded worldwide in {{w|swine}}. The U.N. mission is scheduled to perform 10 days scientific tests, on two hog farms in {{w|Manaoag}}, {{w|Pangasinan}} and {{w|Pandi}}, {{w|Bulacan}}, but it would take months to publish evaluation reports on the virus. 

As early as May, a high incidence of swine sickness and death in three provinces caused Philippine authorities in August to send samples from the dead pigs to the NY {{w|Plum Island Animal Disease Center}}. The results found the presence of several diseases, including Ebola Reston virus and PRRS.

In late October laboratory tests confirmed that pigs in {{w|Nueva Ecija}} and Bulacan farms were infected with the Ebola-Reston virus and the highly virulent strain of {{w|Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus}} (PRRS). In early 2007 pigs on those farms died at a faster rate than usual amid the conducted lab tests. PRRSV, or Blue-Ear Pig Disease (''zhū láněr bìng'' 豬藍耳病), is a viral and economically important pandemic disease which causes reproductive failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness in young pigs. Initially referred to as 'mystery swine disease' or 'mystery reproductive syndrome', it was first reported in 1987 in North America and Central Europe.  The disease costs the United States swine industry around $600 million annually.

In December, the Philippine health authorities conducted testing of about 10,000 swine in two northern [[Luzon]] quarantined farms. Reuters reported that "the Ebola-Reston virus in some pigs in two commercial farms and two backyard farms in the Philippines were discovered by accident in United States laboratory tests in September, when samples were sent to test another disease."

[[Ebola]] virus is one of at least 18 known viruses capable of causing the viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome. It is the common term for a group of viruses belonging to genus Ebolavirus, family Filoviridae, and for the disease which they cause, Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The virus is named after the {{w|Ebola River}} where the first recognized outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever occurred in 1976. The viruses are characterized by long filaments and have a similar shape to the Marburg virus, also in the family Filoviridae, and share similar disease symptoms. Since its discovery, Ebolavirus has been responsible for a number of deaths.

In the central [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC), the highly contagious Ebola virus was first detected in September, according to {{w|Medecins Sans Frontieres}}. "As of Tuesday January 7, a total of 42 patients have been reported with suspected Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the province of Western Kasai... 13 of these 42 patients suspected of having Ebola have died," it said.
[[File:Ebola virus em.jpg|left|thumb|125px|Transmission {{w|Electron microscope|Electron Micrograph}} of the [[Ebola]] Virus.]]
The {{w|Reston ebolavirus}} is suspected of being either another subtype of the Ebola or a new filovirus of Asian origin. It was first discovered in {{w|Crab-eating Macaque|crab-eating macaques}} originating in the Philippines, from {{w|Covance|Hazleton Laboratories}} (now Covance) in 1989. This discovery attracted significant media attention and led to the publication of {{w|The Hot Zone}}. There was then, an outbreak of {{w|viral hemorrhagic fever}} among monkeys imported from the Philippines to {{w|Reston, Virginia|Reston}}, [[Virginia]]. The Ebola-Reston strain was discovered among Philippine monkeys in the U.S. again in 1990 and 1996, and in Italy in 1992.

According to the World Health Organization, African strains kill 50 percent to 90 percent of those infected through lethal bleeding and organ failure. “Since the 1970s, scientists, veterinarians, microbiologists and physicians have been looking at thousands of species to see if they can find this elusive reservoir, and we have been pretty much empty-handed,” Juan Lubroth, head of infectious diseases in the animal health unit of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, explained. 

Despite its status as a {{w|Biosafety level|Level-4}} organism, the Reston ebolavirus is non-pathogenic to humans and is only mildly fatal to monkeys; the perception of its lethality was skewed due to the monkey's coinfection with {{w|Simian hemorrhagic fever virus}} (SHFV). During the incident in which it was discovered, six animal handlers eventually became seroconverted, one of whom had cut himself while performing a necropsy on the liver of an infected monkey. When the handler failed to become ill, it was concluded that the virus had a very low pathogenicity to humans.

In January 1997, The Philippines Department of Environment and Natural Resources had ordered the immediate slaughter of some 600 monkeys in Ferlite, a breeding farm in {{w|Laguna}}, to prevent an outbreak of the deadly Ebola Reston strain virus.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] had donated 8,000 test kits to diagnose the ebola reston strain. "I am more concerned in the international community because we have proven in our December sales that this ebola did not affect consumer confidence," Albert R. T. Lim, president of the National Federation of Hog Farmers, Inc., warned. The Philippines Department of Agriculture (DA) has directed the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) and the National Meat Inspection Commission (NMIC) to conduct swine tests in {{w|South Cotabato}} using the US test kits for the Ebola Reston virus, before approval of the "Meat in a Box" shipment to Singapore. The initial export of the meat for December was deferred pending outcome of the ERV tests.

Meanwhile, in eight {{w|Barangay|Barangays}} of {{w|Santa Maria, Davao del Sur}}, in [[Mindanao]], at least 50 pigs died since December due to viral and bacterial infections. Dr. Nestor Barroga, provincial veterinarian, said that he could not however detect yet the type of the infecting virus. The village of Pong-pong had the largest number of casualties. Mercy Olalo, a hog raiser, said their pigs would suddenly become weak and eventually die. "The pigs developed red skins and they salivate excessively," she said.

United Nations suspends operations in Gaza after schools and trucks are hit by Israeli forces
{{date|January 9, 2009}}
{{United Nations}}The [[United Nations]] (UN) suspended all of its operations in [[Gaza]] from yesterday, after the bombing of a convoy of UN aid trucks which killed one [[Palestine|Palestinian]] driver, and wounded three others. Thursday was the second day of attacks on UN targets after three UN schools housing refugees were bombed on Tuesday, killing over 50 civilians. 

"UNRWA decided to suspend all its operations in the Gaza Strip because of the increasing hostile actions against its premises and personnel," Adnan Abu Hasna, a Gaza-based spokesman for the {{w|United Nations Relief and Works Agency}} (UNRWA), said yesterday.  Richard Miron, spokesman for the UN said that the [[Israel]]i military had been notified in advance of the coordinates of the relief trucks saying, "This underlines the fundamental insecurity inside Gaza at a time when we are trying to address the dire humanitarian needs of the population there."

The bombing of the UN trucks was the last straw for the UN, already angered after Israeli tanks fired on a UN school housing refugees killing 50 including an entire family of seven young children. The UN said that they had given Israel the {{w|GPS}} coordinates of their schools, and demanded accountability for the attacks. Israel's government says it is investigating the incidents.  

More schools were attacked including the al-Fakhora School killing 40 people, many of them women and children.  Hours before the attack on the al-Fakhora School was an attack on Asma Elementary School which killed three Palestinian cousins. The cousin's father said the bodies were so mangled he couldn't tell the bodies apart, "We came to the school when the Israelis warned us to leave," he said. "We hoped it would be safe. We were 20 in one room. We had no electricity, no blankets, no food. "Suddenly we heard a bomb that shook the school. Windows smashed. Children started to scream. A relative came and told me one of my sons was killed. I found my son's body with his two cousins. They were cut into pieces by the shell."  
Like al-Fakhora, Asma Elementary is an UNRWA school.

The {{w|International Committee of the Red Cross}} (ICRC) said on yesterday that they were trying for four days to get their ambulances to a Gaza neighborhood before being allowed to by Israeli military forces.  After getting there, they said, they found four starving children sitting next to the bodies of their dead mothers.

"This is a shocking incident," said Pierre Wettach, ICRC chief for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. "The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded. Neither did they make it possible for us or the {{w|Palestinian Red Crescent}} to assist the wounded."

Israel granted a three-hour ceasefire yesterday that they gave for aid workers to enter areas that they had closed off. 50 bodies were recovered during the ceasefire, raising the death toll to 763, including more than 200 children, since air raids first began on December 27. 3,121 people have also been wounded. Eight Israeli soldiers and three civilians have died in the same period.  Israeli forces also shot a Palestinian man in the {{w|West Bank}} during a protest against Israel's actions in Gaza.  Yesterday, a Palestinian man was killed by Israeli forces after a confrontation in the West Bank Jewish settlement of {{w|Ma'ale Adumim}} near Jerusalem.

UN Security Council passes Gaza ceasefire resolution
{{date|January 11, 2009}}
{{palestine}}Late on Thursday the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Security Council|Security Council}} passed a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire between [[Israel]] and [[Hamas]] in the [[Gaza Strip]]. Only the [[United States]] abstained because of the view that Hamas was committed to violence.  
Fighting has continued since the resolution, and yesterday Israel warned of increased military action.

The death toll from the first 13 days of the [[Israel]]i offensive was 770 {{w|Palestinian refugee|Palestinians}} and 14 Israelis.
[[File:UN Members Flags2.JPG|thumb|left]]
US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] has given an explanation for why the United States abstained and did not veto the resolution. "...But after a great deal of consideration, we decided that this resolution, the text of which we support, the goals of which we support, and the objectives that we fully support, should indeed be allowed to go forward. I believe in doing so, the council has provided a roadmap for a sustainable, durable peace in Gaza."

[[Palestine|Palestinian Authority]] Foreign Minister {{w|Riyad al-Maliki}} has commented that the resolution was still a disappointment. "To tell you the truth, we have really expected that all countries would vote in favor. Are we happy? No, we are not really happy. We expected something more. But we are really satisfied with the outcome so far. What really concerns us the most is the immediate applicability of the resolution on ground. We fear, and we have reasons to do so, that Israel will delay its acceptance and implementation of the cease-fire for few hours, if not few days."

Israel continued to drop warning leaflets and send phone messages to Gaza residents, with one phone message on Saturday saying that the "third stage" of their operation will begin soon.
United Nations aid agency {{w|UNRWA}} resumed aid shipments yesterday, after halting them on Thursday citing safety risks.

''A compilation of brief news reports on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Day 20''<br>

===Hamas agrees to outlines of ceasefire brokered by Egypt, heavy fighting continues===
[[File:Gaza conflict map.png|thumb|rigth|200px|Map of the Gaza Strip]]
Fighting and a heavy exchange of fire  between [[Israel]] and [[w:Hamas|Hamas]] continued in the [[Gaza Strip]] overnight despite Hamas agreeing to the main outlines of a ceasefire brokered by officials in [[Egypt]]. 

On ''[[w:Ramattan|Ramattan]]'s'' live video feed of the strip, Israeli tanks and gunships could be seen continuing to strike their targets, while Hamas fought Israeli soldiers on the streets. This marks the third night of intense bombings and exchanges. The fighting has brought the Palestinian death toll from the Israeli offensive to over 1,000, leaving thousands more injured. 

"[We] presented to the Egyptian leadership our detailed vision," said Hamas in a statement which also added that Hamas did not reject the proposal.

The Israeli government is said to be looking at details of Hamas's proposal, but so far no agreement has been reached between the two sides. Damage incurred from the war is estimated to cost Gaza nearly [[w:United States dollars|US]]$1.5 billion.

===Osama bin Laden calls for a violent jihad against Israel===
[[File:Laden.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Osama bin Laden (file photo)]]
The leader of [[al-Qaeda]], [[Osama bin Laden]] has released a new audio tape calling for a "holy war" against [[Israel]] for their offensive against the [[Gaza Strip]] in [[Palestine]]. The message appeared on [[Islam|Islamist]] extremist websites in the overnight hours.

Bin Laden's message has yet to be verified by intelligence officials in the [[United States]], but reports say the voice on the tape is similar to previous recording released by bin Laden. In the tape, he calls on Palestinians to engage in a jihad against Israel to "stop the aggression against Gaza" and "liberate Palestine."

===President of the UN general assembly claims Israel is committing genocide===

On Tuesday, [[w:Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann|Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann]], President of the [[United Nations]] General Assembly, condemned [[Israel]]'s attack on the Gaza Strip saying, "The number of victims in Gaza is increasing by the day... The situation is untenable. It's genocide." Over 1,000 [[Palestine|Palestinians]] have died since the bombings began on December 27, 2008 and over 4,300 have been injured.  

Gabriela Shalev, Israel's ambassador to the UN, called d'Escoto an "Israel hater" for having hugged [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], the [[Iran|Iranian]] president. Israel claims it began bombarding Gaza to eliminate rockets being fired by Hamas and Palestinian fighters inside the Strip.

"You have to attack problems at their root cause and the Palestinian people have been subjected to subhuman treatment for decades and this [the Israeli offensive] is going to make matters worse," added d'Escoto.

Main UN compound in Gaza shelled with 'white phosphorus'
{{date|January 15, 2009}}
{{Palestine}}A spokesman says that the [[Gaza]] headquarters of the [[w:United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA) has been hit by shells containing [[w:White phosphorus (weapon)|white phosphorus]]. 

[[Ban Ki-moon]], the [[United Nations]] (UN) Secretary-General, expressed "strong protest and outrage" to the [[Israel]]i Government over the attack. "The number of casualties has reached an unbearable point," said Ban.

[[Ehud Olmert]] responded by saying that there were Palestinian fighters in the compound, launching mortars at Israeli troops.

"We do not want such incidents to take place and I am sorry for it but I don’t know if you know, but Hamas fired from the UNRWA site. This is a sad incident and I apologise for it," Olmert said.

A previous accusation was made against the UN after another UN building housing refugees was hit by Israeli tank shells a week ago.  According to UNRWA official Christopher Gunness, the accusation was later retracted by the Israeli government.

[[w:Ehud Barak|Ehud Barak]], the Israeli Defence Minister, said it was "a grave mistake".

Along with UNRWA headquarters, a [[Palestine|Palestinian]] hospital was set ablaze, and a media headquarters housing the [[w:Reuters|Reuters]] news agency and other Palestinian reporters was also hit wounding two cameramen.  Around 500 people were sheltering in the Al-Quds hospital when it was bombed by Israel and hospital officials say they were hit with white phosphorus, a substance which sparks fires which cannot be put out by water and which causes serious burns and respiratory problems to anyone who comes in contact with it.

Adnan Abu Hasna, a spokesman for UNRWA, said fires were still raging hours after the attack and "tens of millions of dollars worth of aid" had been destroyed.  

Christopher Gunness issued a statement on the attacks saying, "There have been three hits on the UNRWA headquarters, the UNRWA compound in Gaza, including, I’m told by [UNRWA head] John Ging, white phosphorus. Three of our staff members have been injured. The workshop in our compound is in flames, and nearby are loaded fuel tankers. So the situation is extremely dangerous and extremely serious. We have been on the phone to the Israeli authorities, asking them to call off their fire from around the compound of a neutral international organization. We have not had the answer we want."  UNRWA reports that the fire at the compound will destroy tons of medical and food aid.  

[[w:United Nations Children's Fund|United Nations Children's Fund]] joined the Red Cross in speaking out against the violence today, saying the deaths of children in Gaza were unacceptable.

UN chief visits Gaza, demands investigation into attacks on UN facilities
{{date|January 21, 2009}}
{{Palestine}}Secretary General of the [[United Nations]], [[Ban Ki-moon]], has demanded a full investigation into the attacks on UN schools in the [[Gaza Strip]] after personally visiting the destroyed complexes in the Strip. 

"I am just appalled and not able to describe how I am feeling having seen this ... it's an outrageous and totally unacceptable attack against the UN. I have protested many times, and I protest again in the strongest terms," stated Ban during a press conference in the Strip on Tuesday. Ban also denounced the "shocking and alarming" devastation in Gaza, and also added that he believes rocket attacks from [[w:Hamas|Hamas]] are "unnacceptable". He also said that the UN would help the Palestinians overcome the devastation which he described as, "shocking and alarming".  
[[File:Unrwaschool.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[w:UNRWA|UNRWA]] chief [[w:John Ging|John Ging]] speaks to the press at a UNRWA facility in Gaza on January 15, 2009. {{image credit|ISM Palestine}}]]
The schools shelled by Israel, were housing refugees when they were hit with tank shells, one of the attacks killed 50 refugees. At first Israel claimed there was mortar fire from Hamas militants coming from the schools, the Israeli army later retracted those claims and says it is investigating the incidents.

A spokesman for the UN has said Ban's purpose in Gaza was to "express solidarity with [[Palestine|Palestinian]] suffering". Ban also plans to visit parts of Israel struck by Hamas rockets.

Decomposing bodies continue to be pulled from the rubble in Gaza bringing death toll to 1,300, among the dead are 400 children, and 100 women. The UN says that 400,000 Palestinians are without running water, and that 100,000 people have been left homeless. The [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] has warned that there is a high possibility that diseases may break out because of the number of decomposing bodies and the sewage that now runs through the streets in the Strip.

Israeli foreign minister [[w:Tzipi Livni|Tzipi Livni]] said on a radio programme: "We had achievements that for a long time Israel did not have. And therefore, you also have to know when to make the decision to stop and look. If Hamas got the message that we sent so harshly, then we can stop. If Hamas tries to continue to shoot, then we will continue."

[[w:Shaul Mofaz|Shaul Mofaz]] the transport minister of Israel said, "I think Gazans understand today that it is Hamas that led them to this reality."

After a six month ceasefire agreement expired without a halt to Israel's blockade of Gaza's boundaries, Hamas escalated rocket attacks on southern Israel.  On December 27, Israel began its assault on Gaza to eliminate the rocket fire. The offensive lasted more than three weeks.

US Senate confirms Clinton as Secretary of State
{{date|January 22, 2009}}
{{publish}}
{{United States infobox}}
The United States Senate has, in a 94–2 vote yesterday, approved [[Hillary Clinton]] as the next [[w:United States Secretary of State|United States Secretary of State]]. She is now the 67th person to hold that position and succeeds [[Condoleezza Rice]].

[[File:2009 0121 clinton 290 1.jpg|thumb|left|Hillary Clinton takes the oath of office.]]

During the Senate debate, the issue of the foundation of Hillary's husband, former President [[Bill Clinton]], was again raised, as it was during the hearing held by the [[w:United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]]. Some politicians have expressed concern that foreign donations to the foundation may create conflicts of interest for Hillary, as the Secretary of State is the country's top diplomat. The foundation employs Bill Clinton as its head.

"I intend to vote for her confirmation. But I also think it's important to flesh out the concerns raised," Senator [[w:John Cornyn|John Cornyn]] said. "If we are going to restore trust between the American people and their government, we need to be sure the reality matches the rhetoric."

The [[w:William J. Clinton Foundation|William J. Clinton Foundation]] has received over [[w:United States dollar|US$]]500 million in donations and was forced to make public a list of past and current donors. This was formalized in a memorandum of understanding with the [[w:Presidential transition of Barack Obama|Obama transition team]]. According to this document, the foundation agrees to submit future foreign donations to a [[w:United States Department of State|State Department]] ethics review.

"I trust Hillary Clinton's good judgement," Senator [[w:Arlen Specter|Arlen Specter]] said. "I think she will work through these issues."

"The message that the American people are sending us now is they want us to work together and get to work," Senator and former presidential candidate [[John McCain]] said.
{{HYS question left|Have the Clintons done enough to prevent foreign powers having an undue influence on the government?}}
"This is not the moment to delay American engagement in ongoing crises," Senator [[w:John Kerry|John Kerry]], another former presidential candidate, said. "While we might wish for a stronger review and disclosure process, the simple truth is that we need a secretary of state in place to implement the president’s agenda."

After the vote, Hillary Clinton was sworn into office at 5:29 pm local time (2229 UTC). Shortly thereafter, she resigned her seat as Senator. [[New York]] Governor [[w:David Paterson|David Paterson]] will appoint her replacement.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee made further progress on the new administration's diplomatic nominees yesterday: it recommended [[w:Susan Rice|Susan Rice]] as the [[w:United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]].

Red Cross urges Sri Lanka to respect lives of Tamil civilians
{{date|January 29, 2009}}

{{Politics and conflicts}}The {{w|International Committee of the Red Cross}} (ICRC) and other agencies have raised the issue of a {{w|humanitarian crisis}} unfolding in the battle between [[Sri Lanka]]n government troops and the {{w|Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam}} (LTTE), with an estimated 250,000 civilians caught between the fighting according to the ICRC.
[[File:Sri_Lanka_Mullaitivu_Kallapadu_GTM_School.jpg|thumb|left|225px|A school in the town of Mullaitivu, which was recaptured from Tamil nationalists on January 25. {{image credit|[[commons:User:Umapathy|Umapathy]]}}]]Violence has intensified over the past few days in the {{w|Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamil}}-dominated northwest, where government forces have made strategically important gains, including the capture of {{w|Mullaitivu}}, the last rebel stronghold. But hundreds of thousands of civilians, nearly all Tamils, remain trapped within a 300 square kilometer war zone.

The ICRC, the only aid agency with a permanent presence in the war zone, says 250,000 people are trapped in the fighting, a figure that was repeated by the [[United Nations]]. The ICRC also claims that hundreds of civilians in the area have been killed or wounded, though an exact number was not given.

Sri Lankan officials say these figures are too high, though they have acknowledged the existence of some civilian casualties. In an effort to help civilians seek shelter, the government has unilaterally established a 32-square-km "no-fire zone" in the middle of the war area. The army dropped pamphlets urging civilians to go there for safety.

However, the LTTE have accused the Sri Lankan military of firing artillery shells into the safe zone, while the government denies such accusations. Likewise, the LTTE have denied the claim that they are using civilians as {{w|human shields}} by forcing them to stay in the area while holding them at gunpoint. The LTTE have yet to answer the military's accusation that they deliberately placed their heavy weapons near populated areas and hospitals.

In response to accusations of firing at civilians, President {{w|Mahinda Rajapaksa}} pledged that his military would respect the boundaries of the no-fire zone. In a late-night meeting with [[India]]n External Affairs Minister {{w|Pranab Mukherjee}}, the president assured his forces would "minimize the effects of conflict on Tamil civilians." Mukherjee has pledged to send aid materials into northern Sri Lanka. However, some Indian media sources suspect this is a political move aimed at gaining favor with the {{w|Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK}}, a Tamil party in the southern Indian state of {{w|Tamil Nadu}}.
{{QuoteLeft|We have a very large number of people, including tens of thousands of children, trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone.|20px|20px|James Elder, UN spokesman}}Meanwhile, the fate of civilians in the war zone remains uncertain, as the violence has prevented most foreign media and international agencies from entering the area. The ICRC has called on both sides to respect the lives of civilians. "People are being caught in the crossfire, hospitals and ambulances have been hit by shelling and several aid workers were injured while evacuating the wounded," said Jacques de Maio, the head of operations for the ICRC in South Asia.

The ICRC says hundreds of patients are in need of emergency medical treatment. However, the UN says the LTTE have fired at their convoys and refused to allow evacuations to the nearest hospital, while the military had resumed firing during an attempted evacuation. The UN condemned this as a violation of international humanitarian law, which requires a guarantee of safe passage for aid workers on both sides. 
{{HYS_question_right|What do you think needs to be done to alleviate the humanitarian situation in the war zone within Sri Lanka?}}
"It's an incredibly serious situation," said James Elder, a U.N. spokesman. "We have a very large number of people, including tens of thousands of children, trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone." ICRC spokeswoman Sarasi Wijeratne did not explicitly accuse the LTTE of firing on their convoy, simply stating that the convoy had not been given full security assurances.

Sri Lankan military officials say the rebels are nearly defeated, with only about 30 kilometers of seafront remaining under their control. Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara claims the LTTE have 1,200 well-trained cadres left, while the Sri Lankan army has around 50,000 troops deployed.

Global economy could lose up to 51 million jobs this year, says UN agency
{{date|January 29, 2009}}

{{Economy and business}}
The [[w:International Labor Organization|International Labor Organization]] (ILO), a branch of the [[United Nations]] concerned with [[w:labour economics|labor]] and [[w:workers' rights|workers' rights]] issues, issued a report Wednesday explaining how the [[w:Late 2000s recession|global economic crisis]] could create a global employment crisis by the end of the year.

"By the end of 2008 [[w:working poor|working poverty]], vulnerable employment and [[w:unemployment|unemployment]] were beginning to rise as the effects of the slowdown spread," the report states. "If the recession deepens in 2009, as many forecasters expect, the global jobs crisis will worsen sharply." Even for those who keep their jobs, the report predicts that "earnings and other conditions of employment will deteriorate."

[[File:Tailor shop in Nashik, India.jpg|left|thumb||250px|The ILO warns that Subsaharan Africa and South Asia will harshly affected by the worsening job market. Pictured is an apparently abandoned clothing store in [[w:Nashik|Nashik]], [[India]]. {{image credit|[http://www.flickr.com/people/40215090@N00 Andi Hefti]}}]]In a worst-case scenario, the ILO says 51 million jobs could be lost in 2009, meaning that 7.1% of the world's working population would be out of a job. In a more realistic scenario, the report foresees a loss of 30 million jobs, with a global unemployment rate of 6.5%. The unemployment rate has increased in recent years, from 5.7% in 2007 to an estimated 6% in 2008.

Even the report's most optimistic scenario for this year, a loss of 18 million jobs at an unemployment rate of 6.1%, is not much different than the ILO's October 2008 prediction of 20 million jobs lost this year due to the financial crisis. 

The report warns that [[w:developing countries|developing countries]] in [[w:South Asia|South Asia]] and [[w:Subsaharan Africa|Subsaharan Africa]] will be harshly affected by the economic crisis. Although working poverty - defined as having daily wages of [[w:United States dollar|US$]]2 or less - is on an overall decline, these regions are still characterized by poor working conditions, low salaries, and an insecure job market. This will only worsen in 2009, according to the ILO.

"Taking into account that a wage and salary job in poor regions may still not ensure all the components of a decent job, it becomes understandable that only a minority of working people have a job that is well paid, respects their fundamental rights and ensures some security in case of job loss, personal or family illnesses, or other difficulties." The report says that by the end of 2008, nearly 53% of workers around the world could be in "vulnerable employment".

In terms of actual unemployment, however, [[w:developed countries|developed countries]] are the ones most likely to be affected by the downturn, as they are more tied to the global financial system. The unemployment rate in the [[European Union]] and other developed economies increased by 0.7 percentage points in 2008, the largest increase of all regions. "[[w:Globalization|Globalization]] combined with rapid technological advances is another challenge for labour markets in the region," the ILO says. "It is important for workers and employers to be ready and able to adjust quickly to change and to stiffer competition."
{{QuoteLeft|A wage and salary job in poor regions may still not ensure all the components of a decent job...|20px|20px|International Labor Organization}}
Still, the unemployment rate of 6.4% in these developed countries is far less than in [[w:North Africa|North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], which had unemployment rates of 10.3% and 9.4% respectively. [[w:East Asia|East Asia]] had the lowest unemployment rate of the regions at 3.8%. 
{{HYS question right|Are you worried about the findings of this latest report?}}
The report urged global economies to take cooperative measures, including working with the [[United Nations]], in order to stem the economic crisis. It also asks governments to address the "negative social consequences of globalization" by placing on emphasis an [[w:social justice|social justice]]-based programs targeted toward women, youth, and other "vulnerable groups".

In particular, the ILO says governments should establish [[w:public works|public infrastructure]] projects such as road construction, expand [[w:health insurance|health insurance]] and unemployment benefits, and focus on the creation of [[w:green jobs|green jobs]] when devising their [[w:economic stimulus|stimulus]] plans. "When governments design fiscal stimulus packages, it is important that they consider employment-related goals, including explicit employment growth targets," the report concluded.

"In the world, there remains a huge untapped labour potential, and economic growth and development could be much higher if everyone was given the chance of a decent job."

Israel resumes attacks in Gaza, Rice asks for war crimes investigations
{{date|January 30, 2009}}

{{Politics and conflicts}}An attack by [[Israel|Israeli]] warplanes injured 9 people today, including seven school children in what witnesses say was an attack on a member of [[Hamas]] who was riding on a motorcycle nearby. The raid came several hours after Israel bombed a metal foundry in [[w:Rafah|Rafah]] that Israel claims was producing rockets.

[[File:Unrwaschool.jpg|left|thumb|One of many [[w:United Nations|UN]] installations shelled by Israeli tanks during [[Israel]]'s attacks in [[w:Gaza Strip|Gaza]] {{image credit|[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ismpalestine ISM palestine]}}]]
These attacks come after a rocket was fired at Israel from inside [[Gaza]]. Another rocket was fired into Israel after the attacks.  An armed faction of the [[:Category:Palestine|Palestinian]] group [[w:Fatah|Fatah]] claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks.  

The rockets were fired after Israel carried out raids on [[w:Gaza Strip|Gaza]] tunnels which Israelis say smuggle weapons into Gaza. Gazans maintain that the tunnels are their only source of food and water because of crippling economic blockades enforced by Israel. The attack on the tunnels was carried out after a roadside bomb killed one Israeli soldier and wounded three others. 

Both Hamas and Israel have claimed separate ceasefires after one of the bloodiest strings of violence in the history of Gaza that left 1,400 [[Palestine|Palestinians]] dead including as many as 400 children and 100 women. 12 Israeli soldiers and 3 civilians were also killed during the violence that began on December 27th, and ended just two days before the inauguration of [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] on January 18th when Israel declared a [[w:unilateral|unilateral]] ceasefire.

Sources indicate that Israeli prime minister [[Ehud Olmert]] is calling a meeting of security advisors to discuss how to respond to rocket fire stemming from Gaza.

{{HYS_question_left|What is your stance on the [[w:United Nations|UN's]] desire for a war crimes investigation into Israel's actions in Gaza?}}Today the newly appointed [[w:United States Ambassador to the United Nations|U.S ambassador to the UN]], [[w:Susan Rice|Susan Rice]], said she supported the [[w:United Nations General Assembly|UN general assembly's]] insistence that Israel must investigate possible [[w:War crime|war crimes]] committed in Gaza. War crimes that members of the UN have charged Israel with include the bombing of multiple UN schools killing refugees, and the use of white phosphorus in densely populated civilian areas. 

[[w:Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN secretary-general]] [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]] has said that there will also be a separate UN investigation into the attacks on UN schools which killed scores of refugees that had been taking shelter there.

Lawmakers ask US Secretary of State for Gaza crisis help
{{date|January 30, 2009}}

Democrats in the [[United States]] [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] have sent a letter to new Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], asking her to release funds to reconstruct agencies in the [[Gaza Strip]].

The letter also said she should try to reason with [[Israel]] to allow people in Gaza in need of medical attention and emergency transportation between the Israel and Gaza border.    

The letter, released to the [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] news agency, says "[w]e... urge you to express this concern directly to Israeli government officials". The letter says the {{w|United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|United Nations Relief and Works Agency}} (UNRWA) need an estimated [[United States dollar|$]]350 million dollars for rebuilding of Gaza and to provide relief to residents. "Failure to address this humanitarian emergency has the potential to produce a crisis of even more unspeakable proportions," the letter added, "we therefore respectfully request that the State Department release emergency funds to UNRWA for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance".

They also urged Clinton and her team to make a list of "actions taken to date and the strategy you will pursue to address the humanitarian crisis", saying "[w]ith the ceasefire now in effect, it is critical that the United States play a leading role in alleviating the suffering of civilians in Gaza and we respectfully urge your assistance in this task". 

Israel began a ceasefire on January 18 after a {{w|2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict|23 day offensive}}, in an attempt to stop rocket fire into Israel by {{w|Hamas}} militants, but has warned that they reserve the right to resume action if the shelling of Israel did not stop.

UN halts aid to Gaza after tons of food aid is seized

{{Palestine}}The [[United Nations]] has halted aid shipments to the [[Gaza Strip]] after [[Hamas]]' Ministry of Social Affairs confiscated ten truck loads of flour and rice on Thursday. This is the second seizure of [[w:United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA) aid by the ministry, which polices the Gaza Strip for Hamas. On Tuesday, UNRWA said that blankets and food were seized at gun-point from a distribution center.

Hamas has acknowledged the seizure and called it a "mistake."

According to Hamas spokesperson Fawzi Barhoum, Social Affairs Minister Ahmed al Kurd has ordered "the aid to be returned to the agency if it turns out it is indeed its property."

Barhoum further asserted that neither Hamas nor UNRWA was present when the trucks were loaded and crossed the border at [[w:Kerem Shalom|Kerem Shalom]]. He blamed the drivers for assuming that the supplies must have belonged to Hamas.

Barhoum also said that Hamas appreciates UNRWA's work and does not like to see its relief work to stop.

Meanwhile, UN [[w:Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]], through a spokesperson, demanded that Hamas immediately return the food to UNRWA. Ban also called on Hamas "to refrain from interference with the provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance in Gaza."
[[File:Bankimoon cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Ban Ki-moon]]
[[w:Michèle Montas|Michèle Montas]], the UN spokesperson, said that Ban "demands that Hamas immediately release the consignment of humanitarian goods it seized last night, in the second such incident this week, and to refrain from interference with the provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance."

UNRWA said in a statement that aid will be halted until "the Agency is given credible assurances from the Hamas government in Gaza that there will be no repeat of these thefts."

"They had been imported from Egypt for collection by UNRWA today," the statement added. "The food was taken away by trucks contracted by the Ministry of Social Affairs. Two hundred metric tons of rice and 100 metric tons of flour were taken."

Ban's spokesperson, Montas, was asked whether UNRWA was favoring [[w:Fatah|Fatah]] supporters over the rival Hamas. She ruled out that there was a political dimension to UN aid activities in Gaza.

"What we do is (to) give assistance to people who need it, regardless of their political affiliation," said Montas.

According to the UN, the recent [[w:2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict|Israeli offensive]] killed 1,300 Palestinians, injured more than 5,300, and destroyed or damaged 21,000 homes amidst widespread damage to infrastructure. It says there is an urgent need for humanitarian aid, and cited [[w:United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] calls for the unimpeded provision and distribution of such aid.

Philippines is culling 6500 hogs after Reston ebolavirus outbreak
{{date|March 6, 2009}}
{{Philippines}}[[File:Ebola Virus TEM PHIL 1832 lores.jpg|left|thumb|255px|Transmission electron micrograph of the Ebola virus.]]
The [[Philippines|Philippine]] {{w|Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture}} (DA), 
local health and agricultural teams Sunday have started {{w|culling|slaughtering, burning and burying}} roughly 6,500 hogs at a farm in {{w|Pandi, Bulacan|Pandi}}, {{w|Bulacan}} in {{w|Central Luzon}} on Sunday after three farm workers became infected with {{w|Reston ebolavirus}} (ERV) of the virus group {{w|Ebola}}, as a precautionary measure and to protect the local livestock industry.

"We culled around 300 heads—piglets and growers—in two and a half hours; we tried to start the process at 5 p.m. Sunday; after three hours we disposed of 442 hogs; that includes transporting the hogs to an area in the farm where they will be disposed of; with this rate and with some improvements in the procedure tomorrow, we expect to complete the depopulation by Wednesday,” Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) head Davinio Catbagan said. "With the problems we encountered last night, we may go beyond Thursday," he added.

But according to Dr. Eric Tayag, the 56-man team's five captive bolts used in stunning the pigs malfunctioned, for which reason, they decided use instead {{w|8 mm caliber|.32 caliber}} {{w|Handgun|pistols}}. "We need to finish this off because sometimes it rains," he said. But due to other problems, 12 policemen were ordered to use instead {{w|.22 caliber}} guns for  80-120 kilograms pigs. The pig depopulation in the Pandi farm has reached 1,237 Tuesday amid strong rains as schedules have been set from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. daily, Cecilia Yacob, head of the Bulacan Provincial Public Affairs Office, said.

Monday's culling was witnessed by representatives from the {{w|Food and Agricultural Organization}} (FAO), the {{w|World Health Organization}} (WHO), animal welfare observers, Bulacan Gov. Joselito Mendoza and Pandi Mayor Roberto Oca. The slaughter has been estimated to cost 16 million {{w|Philippine peso|Philippine pesos}} (₱), which include hog farm owners' compensation and the cost of culling for five to seven days. 

"As of late Tuesday the depopulation teams have culled 2,663 pigs, compared to 442 on Sunday, 795 on Monday and 1,426 on Tuesday; as of early afternoon on Wednesday, the numbers have reached 3,482," said Dr. Davinio Catbagan. According to Agriculture Secretary Arthur C. Yap, the culling team has slaughtered 2,078 pigs, bringing the total to 4,741 on Wednesday. The number of hogs had increased to 6,500 from 6,000 as some mother pigs gave birth amid the depopulation.

But according to Dr. Joy Gomez, provincial public health officer of Bulacan, six members of the depopulation team at the Pandi "Win Farm" have complained of fatigue, headache and dizziness, and have been closely observed by a team of doctors.

The state will compensate the farmers, however "it cannot be [100% of the market price.] A range of about 25%-50%, but it has to be discussed [with the farm owner]. At 25%-50%, the government may pay the farm owner ₱6.28 million-15.625 million, plus the cost of animal culling operations," said Yap. 

A {{w|polymerase chain reaction}} test to check the virus' presence was conducted by the {{w|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|United States Centers for Disease Control}} (US-CDC) to verify ongoing transmission. "Of 160 pig blood samples that were positive for antibodies, 133 came from Bulacan and 27 from Pangasinan as reported by RITM. Those from Bulacan were traced to pigs at different age groups while those in Pangasinan were found in sows and just one piglet. This means that there is on going viral transmission in Bulacan but past infection with recovery was the case in Pangasinan,” Yap explained.

The agriculture officials earlier announced that the {{w|depopulation}} will be carried out in a "humane" manner, following current {{w|Office international des épizooties}} (OIE) procedures that ensure protection of animal welfare in the Bulacan farm. According to {{w|Department of Health (Philippines)|Philippine Department of Health}} (DOH) Secretary {{w|Francisco Duque}}, the quarantine of the hog farm in Palauig, {{w|Manaoag, Pangasinan}} has been lifted after finding no traces of viral transmission. 

According to Yap, test results conducted by a joint mission of FAO, the {{w|World Animal Health Organization}}, WHO and their local counterparts, reveal that viral transmission continues to exist in Pandi hog farms, which is only 0.5% of the 13 million pigs raised throughout the country.

DOH officials also say a pig farm worker in {{w|Cabanatuan City}} in {{w|Nueva Ecija}}, who had no direct contact with sick hogs, has tested positive for {{w|Immunoglobulin G}} {{w|antibodies}} against the Reston ebolavirus, which is non-lethal, unlike the {{w|Zaïre virus|Zaïre}}, {{w|Bundibugyo ebolavirus|Bundibugyo}}, {{w|Ivory Coast ebolavirus|Côte d'Ivoire}} and {{w|Sudan ebolavirus|Sudan}} strains, according to FAO.

"The additional positive human sample, showed signs of antibodies for Ebola Reston, was traced to a slaughterhouse male worker and was not sick during visits by the investigation team. He does not recall any direct contact with sick pigs but remembers having flu-like sickness in the past twelve months," a DOH statement said, also confirming four pig farm workers and a butcher from Bulacan and Pangasinan tested positive for the antibodies last month.

"Ebola Reston poses a low risk to human health at this time," said DOH Secretary Dr. Duque. "147 human samples have been tested for Ebola, but only six have tested positive. But stay away from ''{{w|Ceviche|kilawin}}'', and half-cooked pork," he added. The laboratory tests of 147 blood samples from workers in the affected areas were conducted by the {{w|Research Institute for Tropical Medicine}} (RITM) and the US-CDC. RITM has also reported that "1039 pig blood samples collected by the expert mission yielded negative results on {{w|ELISA|antigen tests}}," the DOH said. 

The 24 other workers tested were all found negative for ERV infection. "To date, all close contacts of humans with positive anti-bodies who were tested remained anti-body-free signifying absence of illness in affected humans that can lead to possible human-to-human transmission," Dr. Duque said. The RITM and the US-CDC also tested 160 pig blood samples: 133 of which came from the Bulacan farm and 27 from the Pangasinan farm; of the 133 blood samples from Bulacan, 19 tested positive for ERV; none of 27 samples from Pangasinan were affected. 
[[File:Ph_locator_bulacan_pandi.png|left|thumb|225px|Map of Bulacan showing the location of Pandi]]

Global experts said they will continue to conduct research studies of the Ebola strain to determine how it can be controlled. FAO of the [[United Nations]] has initially committed ₱10 million to buy additional kits. "We support the Bureau of Animal Industry to expand surveillance in other areas," said Kazuyuki Tsurumi, FAO representative in the Philippines. "We have not committed any amount of money... [but] we are ready to support a wider surveillance and capacity-building for more tests," Tsurumi explained.

"We can't speculate. We don't know the source of this virus, how it's being transmitted. We're studying that," said Soe Nyunt-U, WHO Representative in the Philippines. "Our current issue is that the test kits are limited because we are depending on the [United States] CDC [Center for Disease Control and Prevention] to send those kits. If we are going to extend the surveillance both in the animal and human side, we need more test kits," he added.

Both the DA and DOH officials have decided to expand the scope of the testing for the Reston ebolavirus by inspecting and monitoring hog farms in the whole of {{w|Central Luzon}}, {{w|CALABARZON|Calabarzon}}, {{w|Southern Luzon}} and {{w|Pangasinan}} province after the culling of the 6,500 pigs.

"As a precautionary measure, while there are many questions left unanswered, these ERV-contaminated pigs should be extinguished so we can move forward and study the virus," said BAI Director Davinio "Dave" Catbagan. 

"In six months we might be finished testing Regions 3 and 4 depending on the assurance of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention [in {{w|Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta Georgia}}, USA] to give test kits. In Region 3 alone, the government would need to test farms in 566 villages that would require around 36,000 kits, but the country only has 10,000 kits" Mr. Catbagan said. "The expanded tests will cover the provinces of Aurora, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac and Zambales in Central Luzon, and Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon in Calabarzon," Mr. Catbagan added.

Mr. Catbagan has assured infected hog farm owners in Pandi they would be properly indemnified after the country's first large-scale animal depopulation process. "We are finalizing the indemnification contract. But we will make sure the indemnification would not be open to abuse," he said. Fatteners and piglets cost an average of ₱3,000-4,000 per head, boars cost ₱25,000-30,000, and sows cost ₱14,000-15,000.

Juan Lubroth, senior officer of the {{w|Infectious disease|Infectious Disease}} Group of FAO’s Animal Health Service, has arrived on Wednesday to discuss in detail with government officials how the agency can support in the wider surveillance. The DA and DOH officials and other government agencies met last Thursday to discuss and finalize the procedure in the burning of 6,500 pigs in Pandi, Bulacan.

"The Bureau of Animal Industry and the provincial government of Bulacan, experts carrying out the ₱500,000 five-day depopulation would observe three guidelines, namely: the main disposal, water safety, and environment protection. The depopulation process will involve {{w|Electroshock weapon|stunning}} the pigs unconscious, burning them in a 6-foot deep pit, then burying them at the site. We want to make sure that our means would not violate the Animal Welfare Act. We are also ensuring that there would be no seepage," Governor Mendoza explained.

"Local authorities have decided to use {{w|Cattle prod|electric prods}} and a ₱70,000 {{w|captive bolt pistol}} with a blunt rod to {{w|stunning|stun}} the 6,000 pigs in Pandi, prior to {{w|Slaughter (livestock)|slaughter}} burning using rice hulls before burying them in a pit dug inside the hog farm," said Dr. Davinio Catbagan.

"About 40 health workers — clad in special hog mask suits and are tasked to facilitate the depopulation — would then dump the pigs into 10 30x30-foot pits that can accommodate 600 pigs each. The pits are located some 30 feet from the infected pig farm," said Mr Eric Tayag, head of the National Epidemiology Centre. "The cull could take up to seven days to complete," Mr Tayag added. A truckload of disinfectants was prepared amid  {{w|Rice hulls|rice husks}} to be used in the burning.

The Pandi culling will be the first large-scale depopulation because of a disease, according to Samuel B. Animas, chief of BAI's animal health division. "Only one to three pigs are slaughtered at a time in backyard farms during the foot and mouth disease infection [in the 1990s]," he added.

Meanwhile, at the 18th hog farmers convention, which was launched on Monday at {{w|Club Filipino}}, the president of the National Federation of Hog Farmers, Albert R. T. Lim, Jr., said hog farmers have feared the effects of Reston ebolavirus virus on industry, since hog exports were banned due to the outbreak. "We are also apprehensive that if we keep on talking about this thing, some people might just misconstrue or misunderstand what they are talking about and people might get scared," Lim said.

The government has spent about ₱10 million to maintain the two {{w|Quarantine|quarantined}} hog farms in Bulacan and Pangasinan. "Anyway, we always have our hog producers in Mindanao to supply Luzon if necessary. I am more concerned about our exports although the Ebola scare also somewhat affected local demand," Lim said.

Amid the nationwide ERV scare and probe, local authorities have seized more than 200 {{w|kilogram|kilograms}} of rotten pork meat at a local market in {{w|Pasay City}} Wednesday. {{w|Barangay}} officials in Maricaban district have intercepted the banned ‘hot meat’ and arrested Roberto Clet and Rafael Fruelda, who were indicted under the "Consumer Act of the Philippines." The statute punishes the illegal sale of unsafe products like double-dead meat with penalty of ₱1,000 to ₱10,000 and not less than six-months but not more than five years of imprisonment.

Local police has also arrested four vendors and seized their 3,000 kilos of "botcha" (rotten pork meat or "double dead meat") at MC Market in {{w|Balintawak}}, {{w|Quezon City}} Wednesday evening, and allegedly delivered from Bulacan. The four suspects were charged for violation of the Consumer Act of the Philippines and Republic Act 9296 or the Meat Inspection Code.

In December, international experts initially probed outbreak among Philippine pigs, wherein about 6,000 pigs at Pandi and {{w|Talavera}} farms were tested for the Reston ebolavirus. 

"There is no {{w|salmonella}} outbreak in {{w|Eastern Visayas}}, Region 8, said Dr. Archie Lluz, Chief of Regional Animal Disease and Diagnostic Laboratory of the Department of Agriculture in the region. But hog specimens from {{w|Tacloban, Leyte|Leyte}} and {{w|Babatngon, Leyte|Babatngon}}, where 270 swine deaths and cases of sick pigs were reported, were examined by lab tests. The results revealed cutaneous {{w|List of skin-related conditions|"Pasteurella hemolytica"}}, a type of bacterial infection which causes swine deaths due to loss of appetite, dehydration, fever and diarrhea.

According to the DA, sick pigs had been culled from Babatngon, Tacloban City, Alangalang, Santa Fe, Palo, Pastrana, Dagami, Burauen, Tabontabon, Lapaz, Mayorga, and Abuyog in {{w|Leyte}}; Sogod in {{w|Southern Leyte}}; Catbalogan, Calbiga, Daram, and Santa Rita in {{w|Samar}}; and Lope de Vega in {{w|Northern Samar}}. Swine infections have spread to 18 towns and one city in {{w|Eastern Visayas}}.

The Reston ebolavirus is suspected to be a subtype of the Ebola virus or a new filovirus of [[Asia]]n origin. It was first discovered in {{w|Crab-eating Macaque|crab-eating macaques}} from the Philippines at a laboratory in {{w|Reston, Virginia|Reston}}, [[Virginia]]. The same lab then recorded an outbreak of {{w|viral hemorrhagic fever}} among monkeys imported from the Philippines in 1990. The Reston ebolavirus strain was discovered among monkeys in the Philippines in 1996, and in Italy in 1992.

African strains of the virus caused deaths of about 50 percent to 90 percent of those infected with prior symptoms of lethal bleeding and organ failure, the WHO said. "Since the 1970s, scientists, veterinarians, microbiologists and physicians have been looking at thousands of species to see if they can find this elusive reservoir, and we have been pretty much empty-handed," Juan Lubroth, head of infectious diseases in the animal health unit of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, explained. 

"Unlike the three subtypes, Zaire, Sudan and Ivory Coast, which can cause hemorrhagic symptoms, Reston does not. There has been no evidence that Reston can cause significant illness in humans. When Reston was previously found in monkeys, few animal handlers were infected but only one had very mild symptoms," the DOH's official website announced.

In January 1997, the Philippines Department of Environment and Natural Resources ordered the immediate slaughter of some 600 monkeys in Ferlite, a breeding farm in {{w|Laguna}}, to prevent an outbreak of Reston ebolavirus.

Al-Shabaab and AU peacekeepers clash in Somalia
{{date|February 26, 2009}}
{{Somalia}}In ongoing clashes that started Tuesday in [[Somalia]], [[Islam]]ist rebels [[Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|Al-Shabaab]] battled troops from the [[African Union]]'s peacekeeping force, [[African Union Mission to Somalia]] (AMISOM).

According to rights groups and other sources, 81 people have been killed. Among them are 48 civilians, said the Elman Peace and Human Rights Organisation. Another 90 civilians have been injured, the group added.

On Sunday, Al-Shabaab attacked [[Burundi]] troops with suicide bombers at an AMISOM base in [[Mogadishu]]. 11 troops were killed and 15 wounded.

{{w|Xuddur}}, the capital of {{w|Bakool}}, is reported to have fallen under Al-Shabaab control.
[[File:Political situation in Somalia following the Ethiopian withdrawal.png|thumb|left|Political map of Somalia as of February 3, 2009.]]
"Al-Shabaab fighters are now patrolling the town and the other group fled," local elder Hussein Abdi Isak told [[Reuters]] in a phone interview.

The [[United Nations]] Security Council issued a statement to "condemn in the strongest terms the attacks on the African Union mission in Somalia." The statement was passed unanimously and urges all Somalis "to reject violence and extremism."

"This is a kind of setback, no doubt about it, but this is not the time to despair," the President of the [[United Nations Security Council]], [[Japan|Japan's]] Ambassador Yukio Takasu, told reporters. "On the contrary, I think all of us have much stronger determination to continue to provide and accelerate the logistical support to AMISOM."

The African Union says its peacekeeping force in Somalia — which is supposed to number 8,000, but currently has about 3,500 soldiers from [[Uganda]] and Burundi — is in dire need of reinforcement.

However, [[Nigeria]], which was supposed to send 850 officers and soldiers within weeks, says it now has second thoughts.

"At the time the commitment was made to go to Somalia, what was on ground was peacekeeping," Foreign Minister {{w|Ojo Maduekwe}} said. "But the situation in Somalia has deteriorated considerably. We are not in a hurry to start getting the body bags to this country."

"If we are going to risk the lives of our young men and women, if we are going to put our young men and women in harm's way, it has to be a carefully analyzed mission response. It should not be without adequate planning and it should not be without adequate logistical, material support," he added.

Former Serbian president Milutinovic acquitted of war crimes
{{date|February 27, 2009}}

{{Serbia}}[[w:Milan Milutinović|Milan Milutinović]], the former president of [[Serbia]], has been cleared of charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity by a [[United Nations]] war crimes tribunal in [[Kosovo]].

Five other top Serbian officials, however, were found guilty of their charges and given sentences ranging from 15 to 22 years in prison.

Milutinović, aged 66, was the president of Serbia from December 1997 to December 2002, but was widely seen as a figurehead president during the [[w:Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in the 1990s. The court concluded that he did not have any direct control over the army, and was released from custody.

"The trial chamber finds you not guilty of counts one to five of the indictment," said Iain Bonomy, the judge at the trial. "In practice, it was [[w:Milošević|Milošević]], sometimes termed the 'Supreme Commander', who exercised actual command authority over the [Serb army] during the [[NATO]] campaign." 

Milutinović and the five other men went on trial in July of 2006 on charges of murdering hundreds and forcibly deporting 800,000 civilians by Serbian forces in 1999 in Kosovo.

{{HYS question left|Should Milutinović have been acquitted?}}Of the five sentenced to prison, former Deputy Prime Minister [[w:Nikola Šainović|Nikola Šainović]], Yugoslav Army General [[w:Nebojša Pavković|Nebojša Pavković]], and Serbian Police General Sreten Lukić were given sentences of 22 years. Yugoslav Army General Vladimir Lazarević and Chief of the General Staff [[w:Dragoljub Ojdanić|Dragoljub Ojdanić]] were each sentenced to 15 years behind bars.

All six men had pleaded not guilty to their charges.

Number of cholera deaths in Zimbabwe surpasses 4,000
{{date|March 9, 2009}}

{{Zimbabwe}}According to a report released by the [[United Nations]]' [[w:World Health Organisation|World Health Organisation]] (WHO), over four thousand people have died from [[w:cholera|cholera]] in [[Zimbabwe]], while 89,000 total cases of the disease have been reported. A spokeswoman for the WHO, however, said that the real death toll is higher due to under-reporting because of difficulty reaching certain areas of the country.

The cholera outbreak has been blamed on the collapse of the country's health infrastructure and water systems.

However, the WHO also said that the epidemic seemed to be slowing down. The number of cases a week have recently been averaging around 4,000 to 4,500 cases per week, down from an earlier peak of about eight thousand cases per week.

The epidemic has spread to neighbouring countries, with [[South Africa]] having reported 59 deaths and 12,324 cholera infections since November last year.

US supports UN gay rights declaration
{{date|March 19, 2009}}
{{LGBT}}The [[Barack Obama|Obama administration]] announced on March 18, 2009 that the [[United States]], in a reversal of position, would support the [[w:UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]].

[[File:UN-SOGR-supporters.PNG|left|thumb|67 UN member states (green) have signed or say they will sign the Declaration on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. 57 UN member states (red) have signed an opposing declaration.]] The United States will become the 67th signatory to the non-binding document, which was proposed by [[France]] and [[the Netherlands]] and "condemn<nowiki>[s]</nowiki> the [[w:Human rights|human rights]] violations based on [[w:Sexual orientation|sexual orientation]] or [[w:Gender identity|gender identity]] wherever they occur, in particular the use of the [[w:Capital punishment|death penalty]] on this ground, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the practice of [[w:Torture|torture]] and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary arrest or detention and deprivation of economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to health".

[[File:2009 0116 wood 150 1.jpg|thumb|right|US State Department Spokesman Robert A. Wood]]Accepting the proposal, which according to [[w:United States Department of State|US State Department]] spokesman [[w:Robert Wood|Robert Wood]] "commits us to no legal obligations", would nonetheless be a reversal from the Bush administration's refusal to sign. According to Mark Bromley of the [[w:Council for Global Equality|Council for Global Equality]], "the administration's leadership on this issue will be a powerful rebuke of an earlier Bush administration position that sought to deny the universal application of human rights protections to lesbian, gay, [[w:Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[w:Transgender|transgender]] individuals".

57 UN member nations, however, including many but not all members of the [[w:Organization of the Islamic Conference|Organization of the Islamic Conference]], have signed a counter-declaration introduced by [[Syria]] saying that normalization of LGBT rights would lead to "the social normalization, and possibly the legitimization, of many deplorable acts including [[w:pedophilia|pedophilia]]." [[Vatican City]] also opposes the resolution but on its introduction made a statement condemning legal discrimination against LGBT persons.

Homosexuality or homosexual behavior is illegal in some 70 UN member nations and [[w:Capital punishment|punishable by death]] in seven.

The United States' adoption of the document comes as the Obama administration faces continued criticism from [[w:LGBT social movements|gay rights advocates]] on the subject of homosexual individuals serving in the [[w:Armed Forces of the United States|United States military]]. While Obama has stated he would repeal [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1993 [[w:Don't ask, don't tell|"don't ask, don't tell"]] compromise and end restrictions on gays, bisexuals and lesbians serving in the military, [[w:Secretary of Defense of the United States|US Defense Secretary]] [[w:Robert Gates|Robert Gates]] says that he has had "one brief conversation with the president" on the subject; meanwhile, a US House bill to end the ban is losing its primary sponsor, [[w:Ellen Tauscher|Ellen Tauscher]], to the State Department and no complementary piece of legislation has been introduced to the Senate.

France's proposal of the document is one of several instances in the course of the [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]] administration where France and the Vatican have been at odds on issues of sexuality. France's foreign ministry, in response to comments by [[Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict]] rejecting the distribution of condoms in [[Africa]] to prevent [[AIDS]], led [[European Union|EU]] member nations in rejecting the Pope's position. In September 2008, France openly affronted the Vatican by appointing an openly gay man, [[w:Denis Tillinac|Denis Tillinac]], as its ambassador to the Holy See; the Vatican rejected the appointment.

Former NZ Prime Minister confirmed as head of UNDP
{{date|April 2, 2009}}
{{New Zealand}} 
Former [[New Zealand]] [[w:Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[w:Helen Clark|Helen Clark]] has been appointed as head of the [[w:United Nations Development Program|United Nations Development Program]].

The appointment follows a unanimous vote by the [[w:UN General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] yesterday.  Clark will take up the role by April 20, replacing current UNDP Administrator [[w:Kemal Dervis|Kemal Dervis]].
[[File:Prime Minister Helen Clark1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Helen Clark.]]
Clark is reportedly eager for the role, comparing it to winning her first election and becoming Prime Minister.  "I guess this is another of those moments," she said.  

The UNDP gives training and advice to developing countries to spur global development and to help them meet the [[w:Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals]].  It has offices in 166 countries and an annual budget of around [[w:United States dollar|US$]]5 billion. Its Administrator is the third highest ranking member of the United Nations after the [[w:United Nations Secretary-General|United Nations Secretary-General]] and Deputy Secretary-General.  

Clark has a long political career, having been first elected to Parliament in 1981.  She was New Zealand's first elected woman Prime Minister, serving for three terms between 1999 and 2008.  She became leader of the social-democratic [[w:New Zealand Labour Party|New Zealand Labour Party]] in 1993, and led it until her defeat in the [[w:New Zealand general election, 2008|2008 general election]].  

She has previously held a number of Cabinet portfolios, including Health, Housing, Conservation, and Arts, Culture and Heritage.  In January 2008 Clark won the [[w:United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Programme]] [[w:Champions of the Earth|Champions of the Earth]] award in recognition of her government’s promotion of sustainability initiatives.  In January 2009 she was recognised by the ''New Zealand Herald'' as the Greatest Living New Zealander.

Clark's appointment is expected to lead to a by-election in her Mt Albert electorate.

Almost 6,500 civilians killed in Sri Lanka, UN reports
{{date|April 25, 2009}}
{{Sri Lanka}}Close to 6,500 civilians have been killed and many thousands more wounded in the past three months during heavy fighting in [[Sri Lanka]], according to a report by the [[United Nations]].

Earlier this year, the army launched a crackdown on the [[w:Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (Tamil Tigers) to oust them from their territory in the northeastern part of Sri Lanka, which the rebels have occupied for several years. The rebels have now been forced back to a small coastal strip, where about fifty thousand people have been trapped after the area was evacuated of 100,000 people.

Thangamuttu Sathyamurthi, a government health official in the war zone, reported that people were dying of starvation, and that there was a large deficit of medicine and food.

According to the medical relief group [[w:Médecins Sans Frontières|Médecins Sans Frontières]] (Doctors without Borders), many of the people who had fled the conflict zone had gunshot and blast wounds.

The government has accused the Tamil Tiger rebels of using civilians as human shields, a claim that the rebels deny. The rebels have accused the Sri Lankan army of randomly shelling civilian areas.

The U.N. says that the rate of civilian deaths in the country has risen sharply. On average, 33 civilians were killed per day at the end of January. The number has now increased to an average 116 per day.

Swine flu reported in more countries; WHO warns of possible pandemic risk
{{date|April 28, 2009}}
{{Swine Flu infobox}}New cases of the deadly [[w:swine influenza|swine flu]] virus have been reported around the world in recent days, sparking fear of a global pandemic. The [[United Nations]] has warned that the disease can not be contained. Over ninety cases of the flu have been reported throughout the world.

The [[w:2009 swine flu outbreak|outbreak]], which started in [[Mexico]], has now spread across the globe, with confirmed cases having been reported in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Israel]]. Mexican health officials have raised the death toll from the virus to 152, with at least 1,614 suspected cases being under observation. The United States also reporting its first death, a Mexican boy, visiting relatives in Texas. He had previously been in Mexico City and had had another undetermined illness prior to his arrival in the United States.

Spain says it has confirmed the first case of swine flu in a person who has not travelled to Mexico. 

[[w:Keiji Fukuda|Keiji Fukuda]], the chief of the UN's [[w:World Health Organisation|World Health Organisation]] (WHO), has said that the outbreak could possibly turn into a pandemic, and encouraged countries to "take the opportunity to prepare" against such a possibility. Fukuda also warned that "containment is not a feasible operation".

At the same time, the UN chief noted that it is still too early to declare a pandemic, even with the number of new cases increasing. "The evolution into a pandemic cannot be considered inevitable, but of course we are taking this possibility very seriously. Countries should really take this opportunity to prepare themselves for the possibility for a pandemic," he said.

In response to the [[w:2009 swine flu outbreak timeline|recent spread of the flu]], the WHO recently raised its pandemic alert level from three to four, stopping two levels short of declaring a full pandemic.

A WHO emergency committee recently cancelled a meeting to decide whether to move the alert level to the fifth level. "If we have a confirmation from the United States or Canada, we could move to phase 5," said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the WHO. "We are still at phase four because we do not have incontrovertible evidence this is an efficient spreader."

A portion of the cases appear to have been obtained from human-to-human transmission outside of Mexico. Such transmission is frequently an early indicator of a coming pandemic, and experts expect the WHO to raise its pandemic alert up to the fifth level if such transmissions continue to occur.

The WHO has confirmed that the disease is not transmitted from animals or meat. "There is no danger form eating pork," Hartl said. "If you cook pork well, if you cook all meat well, it kills all virus[es]," Hartl said.

In the United States, [[w:2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States|fifty people have fallen ill]] from swine flu. [[California]] has confirmed at least thirteen cases, three in [[Texas]], two in [[Kansas]], and one case in [[Ohio]]. [[New York]] has confirmed 28 incidents. The number is expected to rise, as confirmations from testing are still ongoing.

[[Image:H1N1 map-2009-04-29WN.svg|thumb|left|315 px|Spread of the H1N1 swine flu virus around the world:<br /><font color=#000000>'''Black'''</font>: confirmed deaths<br /><font color="red">'''Red'''</font>: confirmed cases<br /><font color="orange">'''Orange'''</font>: unconfirmed cases.]]"The human swine flu outbreak continues to grow in the United States and internationally," said the US [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in a bulletin report. "Today, CDC reports additional cases of confirmed swine influenza and a number of hospitalizations of swine flu patients. Internationally, the situation is more serious too, with additional countries reporting confirmed cases of swine flu." 

[[New Zealand]] officials reported that eleven of the country's residents that had recently travelled to Mexico are now showing sypmtoms of the virus. Three of the infected persons had been confirmed to have the virus, Health Minister Tony Ryall stated.

The health ministry of [[Israel]] confirmed two cases of the flu in travellers. [[South Korea]] has reported a case in a tourist visiting Mexico, while [[Spain]] has recently confirmed two more incidents.

Meanwhile, the situation in the epicentre of the outbreak, Mexico, is deterioriating. Mexican officials have told restaurants to serve only takeaway food, has closed schools until May 8, and placed [[w:Mexico City|Mexico City]], the country's capital, under a high alert. Many public events have been cancelled, and masks have been given out to passengers on trains. Mexico City Health Secretary Armando Ahued stated that 6,610 people with symptoms of swine flu were admitted to hospitals on Monday, but only 29 had remained hospitalised.

The WHO on Tuesday stated that it would not endorse travel bans to attempt to stop the spread of the virus. "Border controls don't work. Screening doesn't work," said the WHO spokesman, Hartl, adding that infected persons may not show any symptoms of the disease when at a border crossing or airport. "Certainly, if you feel that you are ill, you should not travel, in any case, to anywhere," Hartl said.

Among the symptoms of the swine flu include temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, [[w:diarrhea|diarrhea]], vomiting, and heavy coughing. Many of the fatalities from the disease were forty years old or younger, not very young or old persons that are usually more susceptible to influenza.

Swine flu outbreaks appear globally; WHO raises pandemic alert level to 5
{{date|April 29, 2009}}
{{Swine Flu infobox}}New cases of the [[w:swine flu|swine flu virus]] have been reported around the world in recent days, prompting fear of a global [[w:Influenza pandemic|influenza pandemic]]. As a result, the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO) raised the pandemic alert level to 5. The United Nations has warned that the disease can not be contained. At least [[w:2009 swine flu outbreak by country|91 confirmed cases of the flu]] have been reported worldwide.

In a special report, ''[[Wikinews]]'' takes a look at the reaction to the outbreak, and how different countries around the world have been affected by it.

The disease, which is believed to have originated in [[Mexico]], has now spread across the globe, with confirmed cases having been reported in [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[New Zealand]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Israel]]. The United States has also reported its first death from the disease in a toddler. [[South Korea]] and [[France]] both had probable cases.

The WHO said on Tuesday that while it was not yet certain that the outbreak would turn into pandemic, countries should prepare for the worst. "Countries should take the opportunity to prepare for a pandemic," said the acting assistant director-general for the WHO, [[w:Keiji Fukuda|Keiji Fukuda]].

"Based on assessment of all available information, and following several expert consultations, I have decided to raise the current level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 4 to phase 5," said Margaret Chan, the Director-General of the WHO, in a statement on Wednesday. "...All countries should immediately activate their pandemic preparedness plans. Countries should remain on high alert for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia." After the announcement was made, ''Wikinews'' learned that the WHO website had crashed for several minutes, presumably due to high traffic volume.

There is no [[w:Influenza vaccine|vaccine]] for swine flu. In 1976 during an outbreak of the virus, at least 500 people became seriously ill, and of them, 25 had died when inoculated with an attempt at a vaccination. The 500 that became ill developed a neurological disorder called [[w:Guillain-Barré syndrome|Guillain-Barré syndrome]] (GBS) which caused paralysis "and is characterized by various degrees of weakness, sensory abnormalities and autonomic dysfunction." Those who developed the disorder did so because of an [[w:Immunopathology|immunopathological]] reaction to the drug. Nearly 40 million US residents, including then US president [[w:Gerald Ford|Gerald Ford]], were inoculated.

==== Canada ====

Screening measures at Canadian airports have been raised on Tuesday to screen passengers returning from Mexico for symptoms of swine flu. The measures come amid reports that [[w:2009 swine flu outbreak in Canada|thirteen people have now been infected]] in the country, in four different provinces.

The [[w:Public Health Agency of Canada|Public Health Agency]] has recommended Canadians who have booked flights to Mexico to delay them if possible. Those who choose to fly anyway will be asked questions about their health after they return, such as whether they have had symptoms of the flu, like diarrhea, coughing, or a sore throat. If anyone answers in the affirmative, they may be further assessed and perhaps transferred to a [[w:quarantine|quarantine]] officer, who will suggest that they seek medical help, or isolate themselves at home.

"These measures will help to prevent further spread and protect the health of Canadians and we thank you for your patience and co-operation with this process," said the chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones.

Several Canadian airlines have also limited or cancelled flights to Mexico. [[w:Air Transat|Air Transat]] and its partner tour companies, Nolitours and Transat Holidays, have cancelled all flights bound to Mexico until June 1. [[w:West Jet|West Jet]] has also stated that it will suspend all vacation planning and air flights for Cancun, Mazatlan, Cabo San Lucas, and other destinations in Mexico.

==== Egypt ====

[[Egypt]], which has not yet reported any cases of the flu, has recently begun a campaign to slaughter all 300,000 pigs in the country, despite assurances by health officials that the disease is not transmitted from animals to humans. "It has been decided to immediately start slaughtering all the pigs in Egypt using the full capacity of the country's slaughterhouses," Egypt's health minister, [[w:Hatem el-Gabaly|Hatem el-Gabaly]], told reporters.

Farmers have been protesting the measure. At one pig farming area in the country, crowds of farmers blockaded the roads to prevent health officials from entering to slaughter their pigs. Some of the farmers hurled stones at officials' vehicles, and the latter was forced to retreat without killing any of the animals.

==== Mexico ====

In Mexico, the [[w:2009 swine flu outbreak in Mexico|epicentre of the outbreak]], officials have announced up to 159 suspected deaths from the virus, out of a total of 2,498 suspected cases. The [[w:Mexican Executive Cabinet|Mexican cabinet]] has announced that all flights departing from Mexico City will be suspended, while Argentina and Cuba have both cancelled all flights to the country. The European Union and the US have both issued warnings against traveling to Mexico.

The [[w:Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] cruise line has suspended all stops in Mexico indefinitely, while [[w:Norwegian Cruise Line|Norwegian Cruise Line]] announced that its vessels will not make stops at Mexican ports until September of this year.

The government has ordered all restaurants in the country's capital to serve only carry-out food, and closed archaeological sites with the intent of limiting large groupings of people. Churches, gyms, pool halls, and other institutions in Mexico City have been asked to close. School classes across the country have been suspended until May 6.

The Mexican government has estimated that the epidemic is costing companies in the capital at least US$57 million per day, and that [[w:Tourism in Mexico|tourism]] revenue has dropped by 36%. The [[w:Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit|finance ministry]] has set up a special fund of $450 million to fight the disease.

==== New Zealand ====

Thirteen confirmed cases have been known in [[New Zealand]]. All of them have been prescribed the antiviral drug [[w:Tamiflu|Tamiflu]].

New Zealand airports have now started to screen at least ten thousand people who arrive in the country from flights from Northern America. Those who display symptoms of the flu are taken aside by health authorities and placed into a quarantine.

"The number of suspected cases is likely in increase," said Fran McGrath, the Deputy Director of Public Health. "While the numbers in any category will fluctuate, this is a pattern to be expected from an influenza outbreak. It is important to note that the 13 people we are treating as confirmed cases have all had mild flu symptoms, have received treatment and are all on the mend of have recovered."

==== Spain ====

Spain's health minister Trinidad Jinenez announced on Wednesday that a total of 53 persons in the country are under observation for the influenza. The number of confirmed cases in the country has been risen from four to ten, including one person who did not obtain the illness by traveling to Mexico.

Until now, Jimenez said that all of Spain's confirmed cases involved persons who had recently visited Mexico, where the outbreak is believed to have began.

==== United Kingdom ====

British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] announced that five people who recently visited Mexico are now ill with the [[w:2009 swine flu outbreak in the United Kingdom|swine flu in the United Kingdom]]. “All of them have traveled recently from Mexico,” he said. “All of them have mild symptoms. All of them are receiving and responding well to treatment.”     

The school of one the infected people, a twelve-year-old girl from Torbay, has been shut down and its 230 pupils given the drug Tamiflu, Brown said.

The Prime Minister said that the country is preparing for a possible pandemic. It has increased its stocks of [[w:Antiviral drug|antiviral drugs]], enough for fifty million people, and ordered additional face masks for health workers. The government has encouraged all British residents to avoid travel to Mexico.

==== United States ====

A 23-month-old boy from Mexico died at a [[w:Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]] hospital on Wednesday, the first casualty from [[w:2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States|swine flu in the United States]]. The child had arrived in Brownsville, Texas, near the border with Mexico, with unspecified "underlying health issues" on April 4. Several days later, he presented symptoms of swine flu, and was hospitalized on April 13. The next day, the boy was transferred to a Houston hospital, where he remained until dying on Monday night of pneumonia brought on by the virus.

In response to the epidemic, [[Texas]] governor [[w:Rick Perry|Rick Perry]] has given a disaster declaration. Schools have closed down statewide. [[California]]n governor [[w:Arnold Schwarzenegger|Arnold Schwarzenegger]] has also declared a state of emergency in his state.

The [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) updated the number of incidents of swine flu in the country to 64 on Tuesday.

President [[Barack Obama]] has asked Congress for a fund of $1.5 billion to fight the outbreak, saying that it is needed for "maximum flexibility to allow us to address this emerging situation."

[[w:United States Department of Health and Human Services|US health authorities]] have warned that more cases and fatalities from the flu are probable. "We expect to see more cases, more hospitalizations, and, unfortunately, we are likely to see more deaths from the outbreak," said [[w:Kathleen Sebelius|Kathleen Sebelius]], the [[w:United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services secretary]].

Swine flu worldwide: update
{{date|May 3, 2009}}
{{Swine Flu infobox}}Media reports suggest that the deadly H1N1 [[w:swine flu|swine flu]] virus, which has killed sixteen people and infected hundreds worldwide, is continuing to spread. According to the [[United Nations]]' [[w:World Health Organisation|World Health Organisation]], there are a total of 331 confirmed cases of swine flu throughout the world, with hundreds more suspected cases.

The WHO raised its pandemic alert level to its fifth level on Friday, on a scale of one to six, and has said that it is possible a transition to the highest level will be made.

----
=== Canada ===
The [[Canada|Canadian]] government increased the number of swine flu incidents in their country to 51 on Friday, with seventeen new cases having been reported throughout the day. Canada now has the third highest number of swine flu cases reported by country, following Mexico and the United States.
"All of them [swine flu cases] are relatively mild," said [[w:Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]], the premier of [[British Columbia]]. "Unfortunately, we may see some deaths. It's important for us to recognize that."

The breakdown of cases in Canada by province is as follows: fifteen in [[British Columbia]], fourteen in [[Nova Scotia]], twelve in [[Ontario]], eight in [[Alberta]], one in [[New Brunswick]], and one in [[Quebec]].

Health authorities in [[w:Alberta|Alberta]] said they have found the first human-to-animal transmission of the virus. [[w:Brian Evans (politician)|Dr. Brain Evans]] said a Canadian who returned from Mexico on April 12 infected a pig farm that he worked at. Around two hundred pigs have been quarantined and are now waiting to recover. At this time, there is no evidence of humans getting the virus from infected pigs.

=== Egypt ===
Despite assurances from public health officials that the H1N1 virus is not transmitted to humans from animals, the [[Egypt]]ian government has ordered all 400,000 pigs in the country to be slaughtered, a move that the UN has denounced as "a real mistake".

Medical staff are to check passengers arriving at Cairo airport from Mexico, and monitor them during their stay in Egypt. No cases of swine flu have yet been reported in the country.

=== Germany ===
[[Germany|German]] officials have said that a nurse living in Bavaria obtained the virus, apparently contracting it from a patient that had recently visited Mexico. The nurse has since recovered. Germany has had the second case of human-to-human transmission of the virus, other than Mexico, raising concerns of a possible pandemic. [[Spain]] was the first country to have reported a transmission of the flu from a person that had not visited Mexico.

{{HYS question left|What do you think of the responses to the outbreak? Is enough being done to prevent it? Or is it an overreaction?}}
=== Hong Kong ===
[[Hong Kong]] reported its first confirmed case of the swine flu on Friday in a 25-year-old man who had travelled from Mexico through Shanghai. The 300 residents of the hotel he was staying in have been placed under quarantine. Media reports say that police officers wearing masks are now guarding the exits of the building. Health officials say that the hotel will remain sealed off for a week, and the [[w:Tamilflu|Tamilflu]] antiviral drug given to all residents and staff inside.

The infected man is now reported to be in Hong Kong's Princess Margaret Hospital, where he is in stable condition.

"I assure you the Hong Kong government will try its best to conquer the virus. I stress we don't need to panic," said Donald Tsang, the Hong Kong Chief Executive. Chen Zhu, the Chinese health minister, said that it was probable the disease would soon spread to mainland [[China]].

=== Mexico ===
Health officials from [[Mexico]], the country where the virus is suspected to have originated, have confirmed fifteen deaths and 328 infections from the swine flu. On Friday, the government began a shutdown of the country for five days, in an effort to stop the disease from spreading. It has encouraged non-essential public facilities and government operations to close down.

Several airlines and cruise lines have cancelled or suspended destinations in Mexico. Continental Airlines lowered the number of Mexican-bound flights by half, citing reduced demand for tickets. Carnival Cruise lines, meanwhile, has cancelled all its stops at the country's ports until May 11. Previously, the cruise line had suspended all of its visits until May 4.

Jose Angel Cordova said that the number of new cases and hospitalisations from the disease seemed to be slowing down; only 46 persons with severe symptoms of the influenza were admitted on Thursday, less than a fourth of the 212 patients that had been admitted on April 20. Cordova called the figures "encouraging".

Miguel Angel Lezana, the chief epidemiologist in the country, has accused the WHO of taking too much time to respond to Mexico's warning. Lezana said that his centre had informed a regional branch of the WHO of a sharp increase in sicknesses on April 16, but the WHO had not taken any action for eight days.

The WHO rejected the accusations. "There are cases of influenza all the time, but once we knew that this illness was caused by a new influenza virus [...] we moved into operation within a matter of hours," said Thomas Abrahams, a spokesman for the WHO. "One of the things we are doing internally is documenting everything we have done, when we did it and how we have done it."

In a televised address, Mexican president Felipe Calderon encouraged people to stay at home with their families, saying that there is "no place as safe as your own home."

=== New Zealand ===
136 suspected cases of the influenza have been reported in [[New Zealand]] as of Friday, the government said. The number is a sharp increase over the 25 suspected cases on Thursday. There are currently three confirmed and thirteen probable cases of the flu, according to Health Minister Tony Ryall.

Officials stated that a passenger that had arrived from North America on April 19 had tested positive for influenza A, similar to the swine flu virus.

Julia Peters, the top medical official of Auckland, said that "we are involved today in an extensive contact-tracing exercise with his place of work." The passenger had arrived on the 19th, but did not start displaying symptoms of the flu until April 22 and did not seek medical help until April 28, when he and his family were placed into a quarantine.

=== Nigeria ===
John Odey, the Environment Minister of the African country of [[Nigeria]], stated on Tuesday that the government has ordered all ships and aircraft arriving in Nigeria are to be checked and cleaned, in a move to prevent the entrance of the flu into the nation.

The Nigerian government has advised ill persons wishing to travel out of the country to delay such trips, while those who have returned from abroad and have the symptoms of the flu are urged to immediately seek medical help.

=== United States ===
New cases of the swine flu have been reported on Friday in 30 US states, including [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], [[Kentucky]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Tennessee]]. The total number of cases in the country has reached 226, with one confirmed death in a 22-month-old boy in [[w:Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]].

In an effort to curb the spread of the virus, approximately 400 schools have been shut down across the country, 300 of them in Texas and a further 62 in Alabama. All high school state track-and-field championships in the two states have been cancelled. In addition, Fort Worth's annual Mayfest, which attracts about 200,000 people over four days, has been called off.

The US has said it will purchase thirteen million packages of antiviral treatment, and export 400,000 of those to Mexico.

An aide to [[w:Steven Chu|Steven Chu]], the US Energy Secretary, has reportedly fallen ill from the virus after helping arrange President [[Barack Obama]]'s trip to Mexico. However, the White House says that Obama is not at risk of obtaining the flu.

Swine flu cases worldwide top 1,000
{{date|May 4, 2009}}__NOTOC__
{{Swine Flu infobox}}The [[United Nations]]' [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] reported on Monday that the total number of confirmed cases of the [[w:Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1#North_American_flu|H1N1]] [[w:Swine_influenza#Prevention_in_humans|swine flu virus]] worldwide has surpassed one thousand. The chief of the WHO, [[w:Margaret Chan|Margaret Chan]], told the UN General Assembly in New York that 1,003 confirmed infections have been reported throughout the world since the [[w:2009 swine flu outbreak |outbreak]] began.

Chan said that there was "no indication that we are facing a situation similar to that in 1918," when an outbreak of the flu killed fifty million people. She did, however, warn that if the virus were to start in a second wave, it "would be the biggest of all outbreaks the world has faced in the 21st century."

"I'm not predicting the pandemic will blow up, but if I miss it and we don't prepare, I fail. I'd rather over-prepare than not prepare," Chan told the Financial Times.

On Monday, [[Portugal]] reported its first confirmed case of the disease, in a woman who had recently visited Mexico. Other European countries, such as Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Spain, have also announced new cases of the flu. Currently, there have been 27 casualties resulting from the disease, with 26 in Mexico and the other in the United States.

The WHO has recently increased its pandemic alert level to the fifth level, on a scale of one to six, although it has said an increase to the highest level is not probable. [[w:Keiji Fukuda|Keiji Fukuda]], the WHO Assistant Director, said that "We do not have any evidence to suggest that we should move to phase six today, or any such move is imminent right now." A transition to the sixth level would only take place if the disease were to start spreading significantly on at least two continents.

Androulla Vassiliou, the European Union Health Commissioner, stressed that there was no need to panic about the outbreak. She said that a pandemic would not necessarily result in mass deaths from the virus.

"We are worried, but we are on top of things," Vassiliou said. "The fact that we have been preparing ourselves in the [[w:European Union|EU]] for an event such as this for some years now, and the experience gained so far, puts us in a much stronger position."

=== Brazil ===

The [[Brazil|Brazilian]] government has reported that there are fifteen suspected infections of the H1N1 virus, up from four earlier in the week. 44 patients displaying symptoms of the flu are being monitored.

In a televised interview on the weekend, Brazilian health minister Jose Gomes Temporao stated Brazil is well prepared to fight a possible epidemic. "The virus is not circulating in the country, and if it does, we are prepared for it," he said, adding that the government had enough raw materials on hand to give prescriptions to up to nine million cases.

=== China ===

Tens of Mexican citizens visiting [[China]] were placed under quarantine this week, despite not showing any symptoms of the swine flu, prompting allegations of discrimination from Mexican diplomats. The action was taken after a Mexican woman who had arrived in China from Mexico was found to be infected with the disease.

Chinese foreign spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu said that the move was not discrimination against Mexicans, but correct procedure. The incident has soured the two countries' relations, as Mexico is China's largest trade partner in Central America.

=== Mexico ===

Government officials in [[Mexico]], the epicenter of the outbreak, have said that there are signs that the outbreak has been successfully curbed. Mexican health minister Jose Angel Cordova said "the trend is slowing". He warned against complacency, though, adding that "there could be a resurgence, and that could occur in the next few days or even much later."

The current number of confirmed deaths from the flu have reached twelve, and 260 confirmed cases.

The Mexican economy has suffered from the epidemic. The government ordered tourist sites and businesses to shut down until Wednesday, after a five-day close down nationwide. The closures are estimated to be threatening 450,000 and costing the economy $100 million per diem.

The United States has pledged to purchase 13 million packages of antiviral treatment, and export 400,000 of them to Mexico.

=== Portugal ===

A [[Portugal|Portuguese]] woman who had recently traveled to Mexico has been confirmed to have the H1N1 virus, the government reported, making her the first confirmed case in the country.

"She was not seriously ill and it is several days now since she displayed any more symptoms. Her relatives and a group of people who traveled with her [to Mexico] have been tested and none of them have been infected," said the Portuguese health minister, Ana Jorge.

=== Spain ===

[[Spain]]'s health minister Trinidad Jimenez said that the country now has 57 confirmed cases of the swine flu, making Spain the country with the most confirmed incidents in Europe. The number was up from 44 cases reported as of Sunday.

Jimenez said that out of the confirmed cases, only eleven persons remained hospitalized, while the rest have been released. An additional 63 people are under observation for the flu.

=== United States ===

The swine flu has been reported in more than 25 of the fifty US states. The [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] stated that thirty states have now reported incidents of the virus, with a total of 226 confirmed cases. The only fatality from the disease in the country was in a Mexican child who died in Texas.

"Virtually all of the United States probably has this virus circulating now," said the CDC's interim public health deputy director, Anne Schuchat. "We expect a number of additional states to confirm the virus in the days ahead. I don't think we're out of the woods yet."

In his weekly broadcast, President [[Barack Obama]] said that he "would sooner take action now than hesitate and face graver consequences later," saying there was "the potential for a pandemic". The president has also requested a [[W:United States dollar|US$]]1.5 million fund from Congress in order to buy additional emergency equipment and antiviral drugs.

[[w:Janet Napolitano|Janet Napolitano]], US Homeland Security secretary, denied claims that the government was scaring the public, saying that "once you get behind flu, you can't catch up. You have to get ahead of it."

As many as 100 civilians die in Afghan raid
{{date|May 6, 2009}}
{{Afghanistan}}
[[File:Afganistan map.jpg|thumb|200px|left|{{w|Farah, Afghanistan|Farah}} in western region of [[Afghanistan]] ]]
[[Afghanistan|Afghan]] officials warned that a [[United States]] raid had killed 100 people, "mostly civilians", in the Afghani province of {{w|Farah, Afghanistan|Farah}}.  Among the dead was a member of the {{w|International Committee of the Red Cross}} (ICRC) and his family.

"Twenty-five to 30 of them are [[Afghan Taliban|Taliban]], including from {{w|Chechnya}} and [[Pakistan]], and the rest are civilians including children, women and elderly people," said police official Abdul Rauf Ahmadi.

The governor of the province, Rohul Amin, said that he thought that as many as 100 civilians were killed in the raid.

A spokeswoman for the ICRC said the organization sent help to the region after being contacted by village elders.  "When [our team] went to the first two villages where these incidents took place they saw dozens of bodies. They saw graves and they saw people being buried."  ICRC officials also claim that they saw women and children among the dead.  

The U.S government has said it is conducting a joint inquiry into the incident.  State department spokesman Robert Wood, said in a statement: "Coalition forces and the Afghan government have received reports of civilian casualties in conjunction with a militant attack on Afghan National Security Forces in Farah Province on May 5."

Deputy provincial governor Mohammad Younus Rasouli said that villagers brought the bodies of 20 dead children to his office in the capital city of Farah as proof that the raid killed civilians.

Approximately 2,000 civilians were killed in fighting against the [[Afghan Taliban|Taliban]] in 2008, the [[United Nations]] says.

Sri Lankan president promises to end war in 48 hours
{{date|May 15, 2009}}
{{Sri Lanka}}
{{w|Mahinda Rajapaksa}}, the president of [[Sri Lanka]], pledged to end the {{w|Sri Lankan Civil War|decades-old war}} against the {{w|Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|Tamil Tiger}} insurgents within two days.
{{missing image|File:Mahinda Rajapakse.jpg|thumb|upright|left|{{w|Mahinda Rajapaksa}}, the president of [[Sri Lanka]]}}
"President Mahinda Rajapaksa has vowed that within the next 48 hours, thousands of Tamil civilians will be freed from the clutches of the Tamil Tigers," a spokesman for the government said. He added the president had pledged that "all territory would be freed from the Tamil Tigers' control".

The president's comments come as the Sri Lankan army has forced the Tiger rebels, known formally as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), onto a small strip of coastline about {{km to mi|1.5}} in length Thursday night.  About 20,000&ndash;25,000 troops have been gathered for the final attack, and have encircled approximately 1,200&ndash;1,500 of the rebels.

The Tigers have been accused of holding civilians as human shields and shooting at those trying to flee, an accusation that they have denied. There are few impartial accounts of the fighting as the government has prevented journalists and aid workers from entering the area.

The country's government has rebuffed international worries over thousands of civilians that are located in and around the war zone that have been threatened by powerful artillery bombarding the area.

The [[United Nations]] says that a further fifty thousand are estimated to still remain in the no-fire zone. In past months, approximately  200,000 civilians have fled from the war zones, and are currently residing in displacement camps.

Sri Lankan armies are largely supported by both {{w|India}} and {{w|USA}}, in a strategic calculus aiming to erase Tamil tiger resistances, who claim communist background. Tamils 1983's resistances had start following segregation against them.

WHO director: Pandemic alert level will not be raised
{{date|May 19, 2009}}
{{Swine Flu infobox}}
[[Image:Margaret Chan.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Margaret Chan, director of the UN's WHO {{Image credit|[[w:Agência Brasil|Agência Brasil]]}}]]
The [[w:2009 swine flu outbreak|H1N1 swine flu]] has now spread to many parts of the globe. The [[World Health Organisation|World Health Organisation]] reports that there are 8,829 confirmed cases in forty countries, most of them in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]]. 76 people have been confirmed dead from the influenza.

Many countries, among them [[China]], [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom]], have warned the WHO to be cautious about declaring a global pandemic. They say that such an announcement, if delivered prematurely, could cause mass panic and confusion. WHO director [[w:Margaret Chan|Margaret Chan]] said that the organisation had listened to the countries' concerns, and will not raise the pandemic alert level from five to six, on a scale of one to six. A transition to the sixth level means that the disease is circulating actively on at least two continents.

"On 29 April, I raised the level of pandemic influenza alert from phase 4 to phase 5. We remain in phase 5 today. This virus may have given us a grace period, but we do not know how long this grace period will last. No one can say whether this is just the calm before the storm," Chan said at the WHO's annual meeting. However, she added that the disease could possibly pose a very serious threat to the world's population.

"I strongly urge the international community to use this grace period wisely. I strongly urge you to look closely at anything and everything we can do, collectively, to protect developing countries from, once again, bearing the brunt of a global contagion."

"A new influenza virus with great pandemic potential, the new influenza A (H1N1) strain, has emerged," Chan said.

Chan said the WHO hadn't yet told antiviral manufacturers to start producing a specific vaccine for this specific strain of the virus. She urged countries to be careful and not squander their medical supplies, saying that "manufacturing capacity for antiviral drugs and influenza vaccines is finite and insufficient for a world with 6.8 billion inhabitants.

"It is absolutely essential that countries do not squander these precious resources through poorly targeted measures," Chan said.

Estimates by the WHO suggest that as many as two billion doses of vaccine could be produced per year if needed, although the first ones would not be available for four months to half a year.

[[w:Secretary of State for Health|UK Secretary of Health]] [[w:Alan Johnson|Alan Johnson]] said the organisation needs to have more flexibility in its pandemic alert levels to take into consideration how severe the virus is. "We need more time – we need to give you more time. My proposal is that you should have more flexibility. A pandemic describes the geographic spread rather than its severity and it's very important that that is reflected in your ability to move to phase six," he said.

Key town captured by Islamist Somali militants
{{date|May 18, 2009}}
{{Somalia}}Eyewitness reports say that Islamist insurgents in [[Somalia]] have captured the town of [[w:Jowhar|Jowhar]], a strategically important city 90 kilometres north of the country's capital of [[w:Mogadishu|Mogadishu]].
[[File:Political map of Somalia showing Jowhar.png|thumb|left|150px|Location of Jowhar (Giohar) in red.]]
According to the witness reports the [[w:Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|Al-Shabaab]] rebels took the town after two hours of fighting on Sunday. After overtaking the city, the militants released prisoners from the city jail. At least three civilians were killed by the violence. A resident told [[w:Reuters|Reuters]] that seven people died in the fighting.

The [[United Nations]] Security Council has expressed "concern at the loss of life and the worsening humanitarian situation arising out of the renewed fighting".

Meanwhile, in Mogadishu, fighting between government forces and Al-Shabaab has left at least 68 people dead in the past two days.

The Somali government has started to lose ground against Al-Shabaab in the past few weeks. Currently, it does not control much area outside of the capital which is reinforced by [[African Union]] troops.

UN hides facts about war in Sri Lanka, says French Le Monde
{{date|May 30, 2009}}
{{Sri Lanka}}[[France|French]] newspaper ''[[w:Le Monde|Le Monde]]'' published on Friday an article accusing the [[United Nations]] (UN) of deliberately hiding facts about civilian killings during the last months of the [[w:Sri Lankan Civil War|civil war]] in [[Sri Lanka]] in order to protect their own activities in the country.

According to investigative journalism by ''Le Monde'', The UN did not publish the number of civilians killed until it was finally leaked. According to a UN confidential report, {{formatnum:7720}} people were killed (among them {{formatnum:678}} children) and {{formatnum:18465}} were injured (among them {{formatnum:2384}} children) between January 20 and May 13. A UN official declared to ''Le Monde'' that his hierarchy tried to suppress these figures to remain in good terms with the government. When these numbers were leaked, [[w:Neil Buhne|Neil Buhne]], the UN official coordinator in Sri Lanka, asked to be the only recipient of the figures in the future. Even the secretary general [[Ban Ki-moon]] tried to hide the numbers, according to ''Le Monde''.

Despite the heavy bombings in the last days of the war, the {{formatnum:7720}} dead people are still given as an official figure which was repeated in ''[[w:The New York Times|The New York Times]]''. According to [[w:Vijay K. Nambiar|Vijay K. Nambiar]], Ban Ki-moon's chief-of-staff cited by ''Le Monde'', the numbers could be closer to {{formatnum:20000}}; these figures are corroborated by ''[[w:The Times|The Times]]''. The paper discovered compelling evidence showing that on average 1,000 Sri Lankan civilians perished each day during the first 19 days of May. "These figures are not even complete yet. It’s going to end up way more" said a UN source.

''The Times'' relied on aerial photographs, confidential UN documents, witnesses and independent defense experts to understand the final days in the 26 year old Sri Lankan civil war. {{formatnum:200000}} survivors are interned in the Manik Farm refugee camp. The camp was visited twice by ''The Times'' investigators. {{formatnum:3000}} wounded civilians are still missing from the last known makeshift hospital. A survivor reported hospitals were bombed by the government which claimed the [[w:Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) rebels were using them as hideouts. “They didn’t want anyone left to say what had happened,” say UN sources. 

“We reject all these allegations. Civilians have not been killed by government shelling at all. If civilians have been killed, then that is because of the actions of the LTTE [rebels] who were shooting and killing people when they tried to escape.” said a representative for the Sri Lankan High Commission. Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara of Sri Lanka added "We have not used any shelling or mortaring, only small arms. We know how we are fighting". The aerial images taken by ''The Times'' suggest the contrary.

''Le Monde'' also wrote that the United Nations did not help its people on the ground. Text messages sent by local employees in the war zones asked to "stop the war" and "what is the international community doing". "Hundreds of people trying to flew where caught by local dictators and beaten, without distinction of age and sex. I hear them crying." said another one. In April, Vijay Nambiar asked the locals to keep a "low profile" and play an active role in supporting the government.

The Sri Lankan government denied any wrongdoing. On Wednesday, the [[w:United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] in [[w:Geneva|Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] cleared Sri Lanka of any alleged war crimes. Sri Lanka gained the support of [[China]], [[Egypt]], [[India]] and [[Cuba]].

Bombing of Peshawar Pearl Continental Hotel in Pakistan kills 18
{{date|June 11, 2009}}
{{Pakistan}}Militants in [[Pakistan]] launched a truck bomb attack on the [[:w:Peshawar|Peshawar]] [[:w:Pearl Continental Hotels|Pearl Continental]] hotel, killing 18 and wounding at least 55. Among the dead were two foreign [[United Nations]] officials working for the [[w:World Food Programme|World Food Programme]].
[[Image:Peshawar.png|left|200px|thumb|Peshawar within Pakistan. {{image credit|[[CIA]]}}]]
According to the [[BBC]], [[:w:Fidayeen-e-Islam|Fidayeen-e-Islam]], a relatively obscure Pakistani militant group, claimed responsibility for the blast. The attack follows a threat from the [[Pakistani Taliban|Taliban]] made on May 27, warning of "major attacks" in Pakistan.

The bombing occurred despite the property being heavily guarded and secure. The militants gained entrance by overcoming the guards with gunfire, and forcing a bomb-laden truck, containing at least 500 kilograms of explosives, through the gates. Police official Liaqat Ali told the [[Associated Press]] that the militants "drove the vehicle inside the hotel gates and blew it up on reaching close to the hotel building."

The bomb caused a 15-foot wide crater, and brought down the west wing of the hotel. An injured guest, Jawad Chaudhry, said, "The floor under my feet shook. I thought the roof was falling on me. I ran out. I saw everybody running in panic. There was blood and pieces of glass everywhere."

The hotel is regularly used by businessmen and diplomats, and is located in a secure area of the city. Neighbours include the Peshawar High Court, Provincial Assembly and the official home of the Commander of the [[w:Frontier Corps|Frontier Corps]]. The perceived security of the neighbourhood makes it a candidate for the location of a planned United States consulate.

{{Audio box 2|filename=EN-Tensions_rise_between_North_Korea_and_United_States.ogg|text=Listen to this article|date=2009-06-19}}{{North Korea}}Tensions between [[North Korea]] and the [[United States]] have escalated after the the [[w:United States Navy|United States Navy]] began tracking a North Korean ship suspected of carrying illegal weapons or technology. Media reports from [[Japan]] also claim that the North may launch a long range missile toward the U.S. state of [[Hawaii]] in July.

The North Korean flagship, the ''Kang Nam'', is currently in the [[w:Pacific Ocean|Pacific Ocean]] and is reported to be heading toward [[Singapore]].

North Korea has warned that any effort to stop its ships would be considered an act of war. The U.S. started tracking the ship because one unnamed official alleged that the ship is a repeat offender of carrying illegal materials. The U.S. says they have no intentions of boarding the ship using force, but would act in accordance with [[United Nations]] resolutions and ask for permission to board the vessel. If the U.S. Navy does not receive permission to board the vessel, then no military, U.S. or otherwise, will attempt to board it using force, although America's top military officer says the U.S. Navy is prepared to stop the ship.  

North Korea also stepped up its defense. Japanese media reported today that North Korea may launch a [[w:Taepodong-2|Taepodong-2]] missile between July 4 and 8 towards the U.S. state of Hawaii. The missile has a range of no more than 4,000 miles (6,500 km), but the nearest Hawaiian island is 4,500 miles away. 

North Korea threatened to fire an intercontinental ballistic missile if the U.N. Security Council did not apologize for punishing it for an April rocket launch, that violated U.N. resolutions. They also responded to the sanctions saying they would start a uranium enrichment program, which could lead to a new atomic bomb and the use of its plutonium to make an estimated 6 bombs.

U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has activated Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and Sea Based X-Band (SBX) to counter any North Korean missile launched towards Hawaii, even if there is no immediate threat to the state. Also Mr. Gates said the anti-air missiles in Alaska were ready if there is a launch by North Korea. 

"We do have some concerns if they were to launch a missile to the west in the direction of Hawaii," said U.S. Secretary of Defense [[w:Robert Gates|Robert Gates]]. Joint Chiefs of Staff vice chairman Gen. James Cartwright says North Korea may be able to hit a major U.S. West coast city in three or five years, but went on to state that it would be very unlikely to be a nuclear weapon. North Korea tested a nuclear bomb — its second nuclear test — on May 25.

"The ground-based interceptors are clearly in a position to take action. So, without telegraphing what we will do, I would just say ... I think we are in a good position, should it become necessary, to protect the American territory," added Gates.

Tensions continue to rise between North Korea and United States
{{date|June 23, 2009}}
{{North Korea}}Tensions have started to rise again between the [[United States]] and [[North Korea]]. North Korea claims that the United States have planned to start an atomic war against them due to President [[w:Barack Obama|Barack Obama]] recently reaffirming the nuclear protection of [[South Korea]]. 

A South Korean Foreign Ministry official on Saturday stated that Seoul has proposed five-way talks with the U.S., [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Japan]] to find a way to deal with the threats given by North Korea. The United States and Japan agreed to attend the 5-way talks but China and Russia have yet to respond.

Singapore has stated that if the Korean flagship the ''[[w:Kang Nam|Kang Nam]]'' is carrying a weapon that is in violation of the United Nations sanctions it would take immediate action.  According to a senior member of the United States military, the ''[[w:USS John S. McCain (DDG-56)|USS John McCain]]'' is ready to intercept the ''Kang Nam''.

UN: World hunger at all-time high due to economic slowdown
{{date|June 23, 2009}}
[[File:Percentage population undernourished world map.PNG|thumb|300px|Countries by percentile of population suffering from undernourishment. Data from the FAO's 2006 hunger report.]]

The number of hungry people in the world is projected to reach an all-time high of 1.02 billion this year, according to a report published by the [[w:Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] (FAO). The report blames this latest spike in world hunger chiefly on the [[w:Late-2000s recession|global economic recession]], which has increased unemployment and reduced incomes among the poor, leading to greater [[w:food insecurity|food insecurity]].

The report, published on Friday, estimates that over 1 billion people will go hungry each day in 2009, a first in human history. This is a significant increase over last year's estimate of 915 million hungry people. According to the FAO, this increase of around 100 million people is not a result of poor harvests, as in the past, but rather a poor economy.

"A dangerous mix of the global economic slowdown combined with stubbornly high food prices in many countries has pushed some 100 million more people than last year into chronic hunger and poverty," said Jacques Diouf, Director-General of the FAO. "The silent hunger crisis — affecting one sixth of all of humanity — poses a serious risk for world peace and security."

Although [[w:Food price crisis|food prices]] have declined from their record high levels in mid-2008, the report states that global food prices are still high compared to previous years, and that domestic prices remain prohibitively high in [[w:developing countries|developing countries]]. In [[Mauritania]], for example, a [[w:staple food|staple food]] such as wheat still costs over 600 [[w:US dollar|USD]] per tonne, whereas in the [[United States]] the price has fallen below 300 USD.
{{QuoteLeft|The silent hunger crisis — affecting one sixth of all of humanity — poses a serious risk for world peace and security.|20px|20px|Jacques Diouf, FAO Director-General}}
The current economic situation has intensified the problem created by high food prices. Many sources of income for developing countries, including [[w:remittances|remittances]], [[w:foreign direct investment|foreign direct investment]], [[w:foreign aid|foreign aid]], and [[w:international trade|international trade]], are expected to undergo severe declines. In addition, because of the global nature of the economic crisis, previously-used mechanisms such as [[w:currency depreciation|currency depreciation]] and borrowing from international credit markets are more limited in their scope, according to the FAO.

In developing countries, the report says, the urban poor are likely to be most affected by the economic slowdown, as their ability to find work is most dependent on factors like foreign investment and export demand. However, rural areas could also be affected, as an urban back-migration to the farms would put more pressure on an already strained rural job market. Budget constraints would lead families to purchase more [[w:grain|grain]] products, which are cheaper than meat, dairy products, and other foods rich in [[w:protein|protein]]. The result of such diet changes is often [[w:malnutrition|malnutrition]].

Investment in agriculture, according to Director-General Diouf, is the key to overcoming poverty and hunger in poorer countries. These countries "must be given the development, economic and policy tools required to boost their agricultural production and productivity", he said. 

Kanayo F. Nwanze, President of the [[w:International Fund for Agricultural Development|International Fund for Agricultural Development]], says that investment in agriculture is not only essential for overcoming hunger, but also for promoting economic growth in developing countries. "To unleash this potential and reduce the number of hungry people in the world," he said, the international community must ensure that farmers "have access not only to seeds and fertilisers but to tailored technologies, infrastructure, rural finance, and markets."

However, the economic slowdown has forced the UN’s [[w:World Food Programme|World Food Programme]] to shut down some of its operations, as it receives less financial aid from donor countries. Out of a required yearly budget of 6.4 billion USD, the agency currently has less than one-fourth of that amount.

Gunmen abduct aid workers in Sudan
{{date|July 4, 2009}}

{{Sudan}}[[File:Darfur-Sudan.png|left|thumb|150px|Darfur regions of Sudan.]]Two foreign aid workers have been reported kidnapped in the western [[Darfur]] region of [[Sudan]]. [[United Nations]] (UN) and [[African Union]] officials in Sudan stated that the two women were abducted at gunpoint from their camp in the town of [[w:Kutum|Kutum]].

A Sudanese national was also abducted but released a short time later, according to officials.

The aid workers were identified as Sharon Commins, 32, of [[Ireland]] and Hilda Kawuki, 42, of [[Uganda]]. Both work for the Irish humanitarian organization, [[w:GOAL (charity)|GOAL]]. [[w:John O'Shea (humanitarian)|John O'Shea]], a GOAL executive, indicated that the women were abducted by as many as six assailants. "We don't know who took them," O'Shea told [[w:Reuters|''Reuters'']]. "There are so many splinter groups in the area you'd only be guessing." He added that GOAL had not previously experienced a kidnapping.

The kidnappers have not been identified and there have been no claims of responsibility reported thus far. There have been two other incidents of kidnapping of aid workers in Darfur since March of this year, but all victims were released within days to a few weeks.

African Union refuses to arrest Sudan's President for war crimes
{{date|July 4, 2009}}
{{Sudan}}
The [[African Union]] (AU) has decided it will not act on an arrest warrant for [[Sudan]]ese President [[w:Omar al-Beshir|Omar al-Beshir]], who is wanted by the [[w:International Criminal Court|International Criminal Court]] (ICC) for allegedly perpetrating war crimes in [[w:Darfur|Darfur]].

[[w:Jean Ping|Jean Ping]], the AU's current chairperson, said of the decision by the 53 member states "They are showing to the world community that if you don't want to listen to the continent, if you don't want to take into account our proposals... if you don't want to listen to the continent, as usual, we also are going to act unilaterally." 

Thirty [[Africa]]n states have ratified the ICC treaty. [[Libya]] in particular had pressed for the decision, with leader [[w:Muammar al-Gaddafi|Muammar al-Gaddafi]], who hosted the summit, going so far as to invite controversial [[Iran]]ian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] to address the summit; the Iranians agreed but later canceled the visit.

A [[w:Human Rights Watch|Human Rights Watch]] spokesman said "This resolution, the result of unprecedented bullying by Libya, puts the AU on the side of a dictator accused of mass murder rather than on the side of his victims, but it cannot erase the legal obligations undertaken by the 30 African countries which have ratified the ICC treaty."

This treaty requires signatory states — which al-Beshir has avoided since the March issuing of the arrant — to arrest any suspects within their borders. Sudan's foreign ministry commented that now "The president is free to travel anywhere in Africa, including those countries that have ratified the ICC's Rome statute."

[[w:Amnesty International|Amnesty International]] also criticised the new resolution, with Amnesty Africa's director Erwin van der Borght saying "This decision by the African Union member states shows a disdain for those in Darfur who suffered gross human rights violation and makes a mockery of the AU as an international body. By supporting a wanted person accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, it undermines the credibility of states which are party to the Rome Statute and the AU as a whole."

The Sudanese foreign ministry said that "We think that Africa is now one front against the ICC ... Most Africans believe it is a court that has been set up against Africa and the third world."

Sudan's government has estimated 10,000 people have died as a result of violence in Darfur since February 2003, while the [[United Nations]] (UN) puts the figures as 300,000 dead with 2.7 million having fled their homes. The [[w:UN Security Council|UN Security Council]] was criticised by the AU for its refusal to consider suspending al-Beshir's warrant for one year, which Africa said could have helped efforts seeking peace in Darfur.

G8 leaders set new emissions target
{{date|July 10, 2009}}

{{Climate change}}The leaders of the [[G8|Group of Eight]] (G8) countries are meeting in [[w:L'Aquila|L'Aquila]], [[Italy]], from July 8 to July 11. On Wednesday, the group announced that it had agreed to a cut in carbon emissions.
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev at the G8 Summit - 8 July 2009-9.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Portrait of the leaders{{Image credit|[[w:President of Russia|Office of the Russian President]]}}]]
The G8 agreed to a target to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, though interim targets were not defined.

"I believe we've made some important strides forward as we move towards Copenhagen," said [[United States]] President [[Barack Obama]]. "I don't think I have to emphasise that climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time. The science is clear and conclusive and the impacts can no longer be ignored."

Obama was referring to the [[w:United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009]], scheduled for December 2009 in [[w:Copenhagen|Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].

"I hope tomorrow when we meet other countries we'll follow that through and this is a very significant development, the first time it's ever been done," [[United Kingdom]] Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] said.

"The commitments expressed today at the G8 and Major Economies Forum (MEF) leaders' meeting, while welcome, are not sufficient,"[[Ban Ki-moon]], the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]], said.

"For us the 80 percent figure is unacceptable and likely unattainable," said Arkady Dvorkovich, the top economic aide to [[Russia]]n President [[Dmitry Medvedev]]. "We won't sacrifice economic growth for the sake of emission reduction."

Suicide bomber kills seven people in Afghan capital
{{date|August 18, 2009}}{{Afghanistan}}
Seven people are dead after a suicide bomber attacked a convoy of Western soldiers in [[Kabul]], the capital of [[Afghanistan]] on Tuesday. Over fifty other people were injured in the explosion.

Security officials say the bomber drove his vehicle into the convoy on the Jalalabad road, which is notorious for being the scene of frequent attacks by the [[Afghan Taliban|Taleban]].

"I saw wounded people and dead people everywhere," a shopkeeper named Sawad told the Reuters news agency. "I helped some people to ambulances, their clothes were covered in blood stains."

Two Afghan staff from the [[United Nations]] are feared to be among the casualties from the attack. "I am shocked and greatly saddened to have learned that two of my staff members were among those killed in today's suicide bombing," said {{w|Kai Eide}}, the special representative for the UN.

The violence comes before Thursday's presidential election, which militants have promised to disrupt. Afghanistan president [[Hamid Karzai]] has said the attacks wouldn't deter citizens from voting, who would cast their ballots "despite the efforts of the enemies and will show their opposition to their barbaric acts."

Japan pledges 25% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020
{{date|September 7, 2009}}
{{Japan}}
Yukio Hatoyama, [[Japan]]'s Prime Minister-elect, has pledged that the country will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2020.

The prime minister-elect told a conference on climate change on Monday that "we can't stop climate change just with our country setting an emissions target. We will also aim to create a fair and effective international framework by all major countries in the world."

The chief of the [[United Nations]]' symposium on climate change commended Hatoyama's plans. "With such a target, Japan will take on the leadership role that industrialised countries have agreed to take in climate change abatement," Yvo de Boer said to the conference.

Japan has the second largest economy in the world, and is the number-five emitter of greenhouse gases. It has recently come under international pressure to implement more strict emissions policies, being sixteen percent above the Kyoto Protocol.

Afghan presidential candidate Karzai wins majority of votes
{{date|September 8, 2009}}
{{Afghanistan}}

D. Ward, [[w:United States Department of Defense|U.S. DoD]]}}]]Partial results from [[Afghanistan]]'s presidential election suggest that [[w:Hamid Karzai|Hamid Karzai]], the incumbent candidate, has won a majority of votes.

With 91.4% of ballots having been counted, Karzai had 54.1% of votes, well above the 28.3% obtained by Karzai's chief rival, [[w:Abdullah Abdullah|Abdullah Abdullah]].

According to Afghanistan's election rules, a candidate must receive at least fifty percent of the ballot to prevent a run-off election.

Meanwhile, the [[United Nations]]-backed Electoral Complaints Commission said on Monday it had found "convincing evidence of fraud", and called for suspected votes to be recounted.

The UN-appointed commission, which consists of five people, has the ability to discount false votes and order a new election to be held. 720 complaints of fraud have been submitted to the committee.

Spokesman Ian Kelly with the US State department said that "it is very important that these elections are seen as legitimate in the eyes of the Afghan people, in the eyes of the international community. And I am not going to prejudge where this whole thing comes out."

"It is not going to be a matter of days or weeks, it could be a matter of months to sort out all of these allegations," he said.

Bosnian war criminal sent to UK
{{date|September 9, 2009}}

{{Bosnia and Herzegovina}}A former Bosnian Serb leader convicted of war crimes has been sent to the [[United Kingdom]] to serve out the remaining years of his sentence. [[w:Momcilo Krajišnik|Momcilo Krajišnik]] is one of the highest-ranking officials convicted by the [[w:International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).

Krajišnik held important positions in the run up to and during the war in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which raged from 1992–95.  He sat on the nationalist [[w:Serbian Democratic Party|Serbian Democratic Party]]'s Main Board, was in the [[w:National Security Council|National Security Council]] and was the head of the [[w:Bosnian Serb Assembly|Bosnian Serb Assembly]]. He used these positions to try and purge non-Serbs from occupied territories.

He received a 27-year sentence in 2006 but this was reduced after an appeals court quashed convictions for murder, extermination and persecution. He remains convicted of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and persecution, charges totaling eleven offences.

Germany threatens to walk out of UN General Assembly if Ahmadinejad denies the Holocaust
{{date|September 22, 2009}}

{{Germany}}A spokesman for the [[Germany|German]] government has announced plans to walk out of the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly}} if [[Iran]]ian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] denies the {{w|Holocaust}} in a speech he is due to give on Wednesday. 

The spokesman said, "We will leave the hall if President Ahmadinejad denies the Holocaust or makes anti-Semitic statements ... we are making efforts toward a unified European position," going on to request a "common response" from other [[European Union]] member nations. {{w|Gabriela Shalev}}, [[Israel]]'s ambassador to the UN, also encouraged a boycott of Ahmadinejad's speech.

On Friday, Ahmadinejad gave a speech in which he called the Holocaust "a lie" and a "fairy tale". German Foreign Minister {{w|Frank-Walter Steinmeier}} condemned the remarks, calling Ahmadinejad "a disgrace".

{{w|Holocaust denial}} is a crime in Germany, where the {{w|Nazi|Nazis}} carried out the Holocaust, a mass persecution and killing of [[Judaism|Jews]] and {{w|Holocaust|anchor=Non Jewish|other minorities}}, during [[World War II]].

UN report says number of "abject poor" tripled in Gaza
{{date|October 2, 2009}}
{{Israel/Palestine conflict}}
[[File:Unrwaschool.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[w:UNRWA|UNRWA]] chief [[w:John Ging|John Ging]] speaks to the press at a UNRWA facility in Gaza on January 15, 2009. {{image credit|ISM Palestine}}]]
One in every five Gazans is living in "abject poverty", according to a report issued today by the [[w:United Nations Relief and Works Agency|United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) in [[Gaza]]. People are placed under the "abject poverty" category when they are no longer able to feed themselves or their family, even with UN assistance.

The head of UNRWA, [[w:Jon Ging|Jon Ging]], claimed that poverty rates inside Gaza had tripled.  He described the situation in Gaza as "unbearable" and called on [[Israel]] to end its blockade of the territories immediately. "At the start of this year, there were 100,000 people that were in our special hardship category, now we have another 200,000 added to that.

"Of course, sadly, this is the predictable consequence of the blockade and of the siege on Gaza. We want, once again, to call for the lifting of the siege on Gaza."

Israel has maintained its blockade of the Gaza Strip since June 2007, when [[Hamas]] took control over the area. Gaza's 1.5 million inhabitants are not allowed to enter or leave the area without Israeli permission.    

The [[United Nations]] currently provides food aid to almost one million Gazans.

UN rights council endorses Gaza report
{{Israel/Palestine conflict}}
{{date|October 16, 2009}}
[[File:Orphanschoolmosque.jpg|thumb|170px|left|The remains of a mosque and an orphanage after being shelled by Israeli forces]]
The [[United Nations]] human rights council has voted in favor of endorsing a report made by South African Judge [[w:Richard Goldstone|Richard Goldstone]] that accuses [[Israel]] and [[w:Hamas|Hamas]] of committing war crimes during [[w:Gaza War|fighting]] late last year that left 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead.  The report was adopted 25 votes to six with eleven abstentions.  

The report calls on the UN to make sure that Israel and Hamas conduct thorough investigations into the alleged war crimes.  Should either side fail to do so, the report recommends that cases be sent to the [[w:International Criminal Court of Justice|International Criminal Court of Justice]].

In addition to endorsing the report the rights council, "strongly condemns all policies and measures taken by Israel, the occupying power, including those limiting access of Palestinians to their properties and holy sites".  Although it accuses both Hamas and Israel of war crimes the report is mainly critical of actions taken by the Israeli government.  Of the 31 chapters in the report, only one is dedicated to discussing crimes by Palestinian fighters.

The report alleges that the Israeli military deliberately targeted civilians, used Palestinians as human shields and destroyed civilian infrastructure during [[w:Operation Cast Lead|Operation Cast Lead]] which lasted from December 27, 2008 to January 18 this year.

Israel and the United States responded by claiming that the report ignored Israel's right to self defense from rocket fire.  They also warned the report might jeopardize Middle East Peace efforts.  

Voting on the report was to be originally delayed until March of next year after considering a request by [[Mahmoud Abbas]] leader of the [[w:Palestinian Authority|Palestinian Authority]] which controls the [[West Bank]].  Abbas was pressured into the decision to delay the vote by the [[United States|US]]' [[Hillary Clinton]]; Backlash from the Palestinian community forced him to endorse the report. The incident has caused large scale antagonism against the Palestinian Authority.

The United States, [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Ukraine]] all voted against the report.

UN claims over a quarter million human trafficking victims in EU
{{date|October 18, 2009}}
[[File:UNODC logo.svg|350px|left|The logo of [[w:United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]]]]{{United Nations}}
The [[w:United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) claims there could be nearly 270,000 victims of [[w:human trafficking|human trafficking ]] in the [[European Union|European Union]] (EU) &mdash; over thirty times the last estimate from 2006. The UN's figures in the ''Trafficking in Persons; Analysis on Europe'' report highlights this and, taking advantage of European Anti-Trafficking Day, they are calling for greater efforts to combat the illegal trade.

Today's announcement aims to bring awareness to the plight of victims, often forced to work illegally in prostitution or labour jobs after being smuggled across borders. Antonio Maria Costa, UNODC executive director, highlighted that few human traffickers are caught, blaming police for not acting sufficiently.
{{HYS question left|Are you surprised at the number of 'slaves' this UN report highlights?}}
In the six years since the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children came into force, the majority of EU countries have taken measures to criminalise trafficking both for sexual exploitation and forced labour.

Costa highlighted that around one in 100,000 people were convicted for human trafficking in Europe, noting that this figure was less than "for rare crimes like kidnapping." Only 9,000 victims were reported in 2006.

"Perhaps police are not finding the traffickers and victims because they are not looking for them," said Costa.

UNODC asserts the majority of victims are women, forced into prostitution; men are forced to work on building sites or farms, and ten percent of the victims of human trafficking in Europe are children, up from four percent in 2003.

"Lives should not be for sale or for rent on a continent that prohibits slavery and forced labour, and prides itself on upholding human dignity", Costa asserts.

Iran uranium talks "off to a good start"
{{date|October 19, 2009}}
{{missing image|File:Elbaradei.png|thumb|150px|left|[[Mohamed ElBaradei]]{{Image source|IAEA (www.iaea.org)}}}}
Talks between [[Iran]]ian, [[Russia]]n, [[France|French]], and [[United States]] officials are "off to a good start" according to [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], head of the [[United Nations]]' nuclear watchdog.

The four countries met at the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)]] today in {{w|Vienna}}, despite a statement on Iranian television shortly beforehand saying that the government would not deal directly with France, due to it previously failing to provide "nuclear materials".

The countries are working on a deal which would allow Iran to send enriched uranium to France and Russia and converted for use in a medical isotopes research reactor. This is the first time that a deal has been worked on regarding Iran's nuclear programme since the issue was brought up at a meeting in [[Geneva]] at the start of this month.

One concern is that Iran has not sent its atomic agency chief, an indication that a resolution of the matter may be be achieved; nevertheless ElBaradei remained positive. "We had this afternoon quite a constructive meeting. We're off to a good start. Most of the technical issues have been discussed," he said following the meeting. The head of the Iranian delegation, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, agreed with with the comments, but declined to comment on Iranian media reports that the government is reluctant to send its nuclear fuel. Talks are due to resume tomorrow morning.

===Defiant stance===

A senior Iranian official denied reports on state broadcaster ''Press TV'' that Iran only wanted to import higher-enriched uranium for its research reactor directly from France, Russia or the US, due to difficulties under current UN sanctions.

Iran's nuclear energy agency spokesman, Ali Shirzadian, said the deal would not end nuclear enrichment activities, as it was not "economically feasible" to purify further low enriched uranium itself to the 130-300kg yield required, adding this was an option if talks "do not bring about Iran's desired result".

===Sanctions===

Iran escaped further UN sanctions after talks in Geneva earlier this month. It agreed to IAEA inspections of a hidden nuclear site, believed to be near the holy city of {{w|Qom}} and to send nuclear material to Russia and France for processing, part of the deal being negotiated at the Vienna talks. According to Western officials, Iran already agreed tentatively in Geneva to major points, but this is denied by Iran.

According to a Western diplomat, who wished to remain anonymous, the talks this week were supposed to seal the deal. "But, since we have had no negotiations thus far with the Iranians, the next couple of days could reopen a lot of what we hoped was already agreed in principle," he added.

UN says more investment in agriculture needed to tackle world hunger
{{date|October 22, 2009}}
{{United Nations}}The director general of the [[United Nations|U.N.]] [[w:Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization]] is calling for more investment in agriculture in the developing world to tackle the problem of food insecurity. [[w:Jacques Diouf|Jacques Diouf]] told Parliamentarians attending the 121st Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union that more than one billion people are going hungry because of under-investment in agriculture during the past two decades.  
[[File:Jacques Diouf (Porto Alegre, March 2006).jpeg|thumb|left|200px|{{QuoteLeft|Where there's a will, there's a way|source=Jacques Diouf}}]]
A recent study by the Food and Agriculture Organization and [[w:World Food Program|World Food Program]] finds most of the more than one billion hungry people in the world live in developing countries. It says no region is immune and hunger is expected to increase everywhere, even in the developed world. 

Jacques Diouf, Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization, says 30 countries were in a situation of grave food crisis, requiring emergency assistance. He says 20 of them are in [[Africa]] and 10 in [[Asia]] and the [[w:Near East|Near East]]. "The events of the last three years, triggered by soaring food prices and followed by the financial and economic turmoil, have demonstrated how fragile our global food system is. This year's increase in hunger is not the result of poor harvests or a shortfall in supplies, but rather is caused by the economic crisis which has reduced the incomes and job opportunities for the poor," he said.  

Diouf says under-investment in agriculture and rural development is one of the root causes of the recent global food crisis and the difficulties encountered by the majority of developing countries in dealing with it effectively. 

"If people go hungry today it is not because the world is not producing enough food but because it is not produced in the countries where 70 percent of the world's poor live and whose livelihoods depend on farming activities. The challenge is not only to ensure food security for the one billion hungry people today, which is certainly an enormous task, but also to be able to feed a world population that is expected to reach 9.1 billion in 2050," he said. He has urged nations to increase food production by 70 percent by 2050, and remarked that "Where there's a will, there's a way."

The FAO chief says studies show GDP growth originating in agriculture is at least twice as effective in reducing poverty as GDP growth originating in other sectors of the economy. He says the solution to food insecurity lies in boosting agricultural production and productivity in poor countries where food shortages are chronic. 

Diouf says production has to be increased in the most needy areas, by the most needy people. These are smallholder farmers in rural households. 

He says investment in agriculture in developing countries would amount to $44 billion in official development assistance a year. He says the returns from that investment in tackling world hunger would be enormous.

Hopes for treaty on climate begin to wither
{{date|October 26, 2009}}

{{Climate change}}International climate negotiations for a global climate treaty are not producing the required results in the given amount of time left before the [[w:Copenhagen|Copenhagen]] conference in December, diminishing the hopes for a resolution at this conference.

[[File:Instrumental Temperature Record.png|thumb|left|Global mean surface temperature difference from the average for 1961–1990 {{image source|[[w:user:Dragons flight|Robert A. Rohde]]}}]]
Major polluters have already decided that the only way for a plan of this scale to take effect is to have steps towards the reduction of greenhouse gases instead of creating a plan which takes immediate effect and shuts down production facilities.  Countries are likely to propose steps at the Copenhagen Meeting.

[[w:Yvo De Boer|Yvo De Boer]], a [[w:Dutch (people)|Dutch Diplomat]], has been overseeing the proceedings so far. "There isn't sufficient time to get the whole thing done. But I hope it will go well beyond simply a declaration of principles. The form I would like it to take is the groundwork for a [[w:ratify|ratifiable]] agreement next year," commented Boer.

The 192 countries which make up the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] show the gaps in-between their ideas. Wealthier nations are planning to help poorer countries with enforcing climate laws and investing in newer technology. 16 of the largest polluters have already begun planning on aiding poorer countries.

{{QuoteLeft|There isn't sufficient time to get the whole thing done.|4=[[w:Yvo De Boer|Yvo De Boer]]}}Officials are attempting to narrow down issues which countries agree on, such as certain steps and the common goal to limit emissions. Negotiators plan to discuss how the treaty will be upheld at Copenhagen. Diplomats have raised the question of reliability, since most of the supporting countries have not enforced any binding climate legislation within their own countries. Until it is shown that all countries participating will uphold the treaty, nations are unwilling to enforce a treaty within their own country.

Although there are hopes of progress in Copenhagen, observes note that radical change is unlikely. "The most likely form any agreement will take will be a political declaration," said Nigel Purvis, State Department climate negotiator during the [[w:Clinton Administration|Clinton Administration]] and [[w:Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].

UN Security Council votes to extend Ivory Coast sanctions
{{date|October 29, 2009}}
{{Ivory Coast}}The [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Security Council|Security Council}} voted unanimously on Thursday to extend the arms embargo on the [[Ivory Coast]] (otherwise known as Côte d'Ivoire) for a year.

In addition, the 15-member council renewed a ban on exporting diamonds and foreign travel, as well as an asset freeze for persons who are discovered to have violated human rights or disrupting the peace. "[...] the situation in the Ivory Coast continues to pose a threat to international peace and security in the region," the council said.

The largest producer of cocoa in the world, Ivory Coast has been in turmoil ever since rebels attempted to overthrow president [[Laurent Gbagbo]] in 2002, which soon escalated into a civil war. The UN implemented an arms embargo against the country in 2004, after a ceasefire between rebels and government forces was violated.

The Security Council said that the sanctions would remain in place until October 31 of next year, but that it would review its measures three months after presidential elections are held. Elections in Ivory Coast are scheduled for November 29; however, authorities said that it is unlikely that the polls will be held at that date, citing preparation delays.

Ilahiri Djedje, the Ivory Coast's ambassador to the UN, expressed his disappointment at the council's decision. "[We] had expected to today obtain a clear commitment by the Security Council in favor of a lifting of sanctions following the presidential elections," he said. "There is no reason why individual sanctions should be maintained. The resolution adopted today is not tailored to assist Ivorians in their process of reconciliation."

UN endorses Israel-Palestinian war crimes report
{{date|November 6, 2009}}
{{United Nations}}After two days of debate, the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations General Assembly|foreign=suppress|General Assembly}} has overwhelmingly endorsed a report from the Human Rights Council calling for domestic investigations into alleged war crimes committed by both [[Israel]]'s military and [[Palestine|Palestinian]] armed forces during the Gaza conflict that began last December. 

The controversial report concluded that Israel used disproportionate force in the war, deliberately targeted {{w|Gaza Strip|Gaza}} civilians, used them as human shields, and destroyed civilian infrastructure.  One of the 31 chapters of the report discussed crimes by {{w|Hamas}} for firing rockets into Israeli towns.

[[File:Orphanschoolmosque.jpg|thumb|190px|left|The remains of a mosque and an orphanage after being shelled by Israeli forces]]The final vote was 114 in favor, 18 against and 44 abstentions. Strong support came from the Arab and non-aligned countries, many of whom co-sponsored the draft resolution. 

Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour welcomed the vote, saying the implementation of Justice Richard Goldstone's report will now begin in stages.

Ali Treki, the General Assembly president, called the vote "an important declaration against impunity. It is a call for justice and accountability".  Without justice, there can be no progress towards peace. A human being should be treated as a human being, regardless of his or her religion, race or nationality," he said.

"In three months we will come back to General Assembly to consider the report of the Secretary-General for further action, including in all parts of the United Nations, including in the {{w|United Nations Security Council|Security Council}}," said {{w|Riyad Mansour}}, a Palestinian-American diplomat.

The non-binding resolution requests the secretary-general report to the General Assembly within three months on the implementation of the resolution, with a view to considering further action, if necessary. 

Israel's deputy ambassador to the UN, Daniel Cameron said that the resolution, "endorses and legitimizes a deeply flawed, one-sided and prejudiced report of the discredited {{w|United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council}} and its politicised work that bends both fact and law".

{{QuoteLeft|"In three months we will come back to General Assembly to consider the report of the Secretary-General for further action,|source=Riyad Mansour, Palestinian-American diplomat}}Of the countries abstaining or voting no, several said that although they agreed with the essence of the resolution - that the parties should conduct their own independent, credible investigations into alleged violations as called for in the Goldstone report - they could not vote in favor because they had difficulty with two specific items in the resolution. 

Another point of some contention is that the resolution leaves the door open for future action in the UN Security Council. The Palestinians have made clear they plan to pursue that option, but most of the council's five permanent members opposed the idea, saying the right forum for the Goldstone report is in the Human Rights Council in Geneva, where it started.

The [[United States]] was the only permanent Security Council member to vote against the resolution. Deputy Ambassador Alejandro Wolff said that although it opposed the resolution, the US strongly supported accountability for human rights and humanitarian law violations relating to the Gaza conflict.

"We believe that the Goldstone report is deeply flawed-including its unbalanced focus on Israel, its sweeping conclusions of law, the excessively negative inferences it draws about Israel's intentions and actions, its failure to deal adequately with the asymmetrical nature of the Gaza conflict, its failure to assign appropriate responsibility to Hamas for its decision to base itself and its operations in heavily civilian-populated urban areas, and its many overreaching recommendations," said Alejandro Wolff.

{{HYS question right|What is your opinion on the report? Do you agree with it?}}Israel, which did not cooperate with the Goldstone commission, voted against the resolution, saying that it legitimised a "deeply flawed, one-sided" report, and disregarded Israel's right to defend its citizens.

"The results of the vote and the large number of member states who voted against or abstained, demonstrate clearly that the resolution does not have the support of the 'moral majority' of UN members," read a statement on the website of Israel's ministry of foreign affairs. "Israel rejects the resolution of the UN General Assembly, which is completely detached from realities on the ground."

During the three-week-long Israeli military incursion into the Gaza Strip, at least 1,400 Palestinians died according to Palestinians and human rights groups, although Israel says 1,166, and 13 Israelis also died. The Goldstone Commission criticized both sides for violations of international humanitarian law.

750,000 could be affected by flooding in Kenya, UN says
{{date|November 8, 2009}}
{{Kenya}}The [[United Nations]] has warned that up to 750,000 people could be hit by heavy flooding and mudslides in [[Kenya]] due to heavy rains.

[[Image:UNHCR DADAAB REGION, KENYA AFRICA DOD 2006.JPEG|thumb|left|180px|A plane delivering UNHCR supplies to the Dadaab region after heavy flooding in 2006]]The [[w:United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)]] appealed for US$2.8 million to help more than 300,000 refugees in two camps in Kenya threatened by flooding. The agency explained that the mainly [[Somalia|Somali]] refugees in Kenya's overcrowded Dadaab camps urgently need to be protected from the worst effects of the torrential rains.

Most of Kenya is suffering from the effects of the prolonged drought; however, along the Indian Ocean Coast and the northeastern region of the country, people are being pounded by torrential rainfall.

UN refugee spokesman Andrej Mahecic said many of those affected by the flooding are Somali refugees living in Kenya's overcrowded Dadaab camps.

"We fear that the looming El Nino phenomenon [...] a change in the atmosphere and ocean of the tropical Pacific region that produces floods, droughts and other weather disturbances in many regions of the world-may now threaten the 338,000 mostly Somali refugees in the two camps, which in any case usually are flooded for three months every year," he said.

Although the yearly floods are predictable, Mahecic commented that the UNHCR is limited in what it can do ahead of time to protect the refugees from their destructive impact.

Mahecic says the UNHCR began digging trenches and placing sandbags around hospitals, bore holes and other strategic locations in both camps, when heavy rains started three weeks ago. Without these and other measures, he says many sections of the camps would have been inundated.

"We are also preparing to locate to higher ground within the camps refugees who might be worst affected by the floods, particularly the chronically ill, disabled people, the elderly and children and teenagers on their own," he stated. When asked why camps were built on areas prone to flooding, he replied that the government allocated the areas. "There is very little choice on where you can put a camp," he added.

Much of the money from the appeal will be used to pre-position essential items such as fuel, blankets, plastic sheets, and to respond to possible outbreaks of disease.

UN: Ethiopian GDP grew only 1.7% in 2009, may not reach anti-poverty goals
{{date|November 7, 2009}}
{{Ethiopia}}According to the [[United Nations]], the [[Ethiopia]]n gross domestic product (GDP) for 2009 increased by 1.7%. UN Deputy Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro said that the country might not be able to meet its 2015 anti-poverty goals due to the worldwide economic slowdown.

"Despite some notable achievements, progress is off track across the continent," Migiro said in the capital of {{w|Addis Ababa}}. She said Ethiopia's economy increased by about five percent between 2000 and 2008, but slowed down due to the ongoing global recession.

"Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals is likely to be adversely affected. The food and energy crises, as well as climate change, will also complicate our work," Migiro said.

The Ethiopian government, however, contradicted the UN report, saying that the country's economic growth was over ten percent for 2009.

Six aid groups suspend work in Chad after killing
{{Chad}}
{{date|November 14, 2009}}
[[File:Coronation in Chad.jpg|thumb|left|165px|{{w|International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross}} in [[Chad]]{{Image source|[http://www.flickr.com/people/36448457@N00 Mark Knobil]}}]][[File:MSF front door in Chad.jpg|thumb|left|165px|{{w|Médecins Sans Frontières}} in [[Chad]]{{Image source|[http://www.flickr.com/people/36448457@N00 Mark Knobil]}}]]
Six aid groups have suspended work in [[Chad]] today after the killing of one aid worker, a rash of banditry, and a kidnapping, according to the [[United Nations]]. The UN says about 37,000 people will be affected in some way by the move.

UN spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs noted that the {{w|International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross}} and ''{{w|Médecins Sans Frontières}}'' (Doctors Without Borders) are among those to halt operations. "To date, five NGOs [non-governmental organisations] and the ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] have temporarily suspended their activities in the east," Byrs said. "Serious acts of banditry in eastern Chad over the last two weeks jeopardise the continuity of humanitarian operations."

This comes soon after a worker for the Red Cross, Laurent Maurice, was kidnapped earlier in the week and another local aid worker for the ''Solidarités'' agency was killed.

Over fifty attacks on humanitarian aid workers in Chad have been made this year by bandits. Relief workers are targeted by criminals because they have valuables and vehicles.

UN: one billion hungry people in the world
{{date|November 14, 2009}}
{{United Nations}}The [[United Nations]]' [[w:World Food Program|World Food Program]] (WFP) said today that for the first time in history, the number of hungry people worldwide will exceed one billion.

The huge number of people facing food insecurity has prompted the UN organization to appeal to individuals for the first time.  The WFP launched the Billion for a Billion online campaign today, in an effort to get one billion people living in the developed world to give one euro (US$1.50) a week to the campaign. 

[[File:Josette Sheeran Shiner May 2007.jpg|thumb|left|180px|File photo of Josette Sheeran (May 2007) {{image credit|Michael Gross}}]]
WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran commented that donor governments have supported WFP efforts in the past, but they cannot be expected to do so anymore because of the financial pressure they are facing in the worldwide economic downturn. She said that the WFP was projected to make only $3.7 billion in donations, about half of the $6.7 billion it had targeted for 2009.

"We now have hunger galloping ahead &mdash; over a billion people now for the first time in history &mdash; and because of the financial pressure on governments we think it's really important now to call on the citizens of the world to help solve this problem directly," Sheeran told the [[w:Reuters|Reuters]] news agency in an interview.

Sheeran noted the rise in the number of hungry people was partially due to increasing prices in the developing world following a food crisis in 2007–08.  The WFP's resources are stretched due to many crises worldwide, such as violence in [[Pakistan]], drought in eastern Africa, and flooding in Southeast Asia.  The organisation can thus provide only limited assistance to those in need. 

"The problem at the moment is that WFP probably has ten or twelve acute emergencies on its hands, each one complex, each one with its own compelling situation [...] We are cutting rations," Sheeran told Reuters.

Sheeran made the online campaign announcement ahead of the World Food Summit beginning on Monday in Rome, [[Italy]], where world leaders will meet to find solutions to the growing number of hungry people in the world. The summit is to be hosted by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

UN nuclear chief says negotiations with Iran at 'dead end'
{{date|November 27, 2009}}
{{Iran}}
The head of the {{w|International Atomic Energy Agency}}, [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], said earlier on Thursday that the organization has reached a "dead end" in a probe into [[Iran]]'s nuclear program. The IAEA's board is meeting to consider a resolution condemning Iran's nuclear program.

{{missing image|Image:Elbaradei.png|thumb|left|170px|File photo of ElBaradei}}
In remarks to the IAEA's board, ElBaradei expressed frustration over Iran's failure to cooperate with the Vienna-based agency. ElBaradei leaves office in a few days, at the end of this November, and his remarks have grown sharply more critical of Iran in recent months.

Today, he said he was disappointed that Iran had not agreed on a deal to further enrich its uranium overseas. The deal has the support of the [[United States]], [[Russia]] and [[France]] and it aims to provide a safeguard that Iran's uranium is not being used to make a nuclear weapon.

"It is now well over a year since the agency was last able to engage Iran in discussions about these outstanding issues. We have effectively reached a dead end, unless Iran engages fully with us," he commented.

"In my view the proposed agreement presents a unique opportunity after many years of animosity and hostility to address a humanitarian need and create a space for negotiation. This opportunity should be seized and it would be highly regrettable if it was missed," he said.

ElBaradei's comments come as the IAEA board is considering a draft resolution on Iran.  According to press reports, the draft urges Iran to stop construction of the uranium enrichment site, and to confirm that it has no other hidden nuclear activities. Diplomats are reportedly confident the measure will be passed, but Iran's ambassador to the IAEA told a [[Germany|German]] newspaper that Tehran would reduce its cooperation with the IAEA to a minimum if that happens.

Some members of the international community believe that Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon; Tehran, however, maintains that its efforts are for peaceful purposes only.

Copenhagen climate conference opens
{{date|December 8, 2009}}
{{United Nations}}
[[File:COP15_Logo.svg|thumb|left|180px|Logo for COP15, the [[:w:United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference.]]]]The [[:w:United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) has opened on Monday with calls for urgent action to curb [[w:Climate Change|climate change]] and [[w:Global warming|global warming]]. The largest climate conference in history at the Bella Center in [[w:Copenhagen|Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] is running for two-weeks from December 7 until December 18. Around 15,000 delegates including representatives from the private sector, environmental organizations, research institutions and government officials, as well as 110 heads of state and government from 192 countries, will attend. 
{{cquote|A deal is within our reach.|20px|20px|- [[w:Prime Minister of Denmark|Danish Prime Minister]], [[w:Lars Løkke Rasmussen|Lars Løkke Rasmussen]].}}
The ''COP15 Cultural Opening Ceremony'' played a four-minute long film called ''Please help the world'' by the Danish director Mikkel Blaabjerg Poulsen to highlight the danger of rising temperatures. The film depicts a young girl’s screaming nightmare about an eco-apocalypse with global warming, desert wastelands and terrifying floods. As the girl wakes from the nightmare she and other children implores us to 'Please help the world'. Poulsen said, “We have made a film which speaks to the heart rather than to the brain”. There was also music from a trumpeter, a harpist and the Danish National Girls Choir. 

The UN climate change conference, the climax of two years of contentious negotiations, opened in an atmosphere of hope. There was an upbeat mood for a deal to be reached within the next two weeks.  At a press briefing,  [[w:Connie Hedegaard|Connie Hedegaard]], the president of the conference, said that “the deadline is working”, but “within the time we have, we must solve the task”. [[w:Lars Lokke Rasmussen|Lars Lokke Rasmussen]] stressed, however, that the talks will have to overcome the deep distrust between rich and poor nations on how to share the burden of curbing emissions. There has been a series of promises by rich and emerging economies to curb their greenhouse gases, but there are major issues yet to be resolved.  UN Secretary-General [[w:Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-moon]] said that a legally binding treaty on climate change will be reached in 2010.   
{{QuoteLeft|Please help the world, please help save the World.|4=Children from ''Please help the world''.}} 
The [[w:European Union|European Union]] has adopted a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels but the union will raise its commitments to 30% if other major players undertake “comparable commitments”. News that the [[w:United States Environmental Protection Agency|United States Environmental Protection Agency]] ruled that greenhouse gases endanger human health  may allow reductions of [[w:Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|U.S greenhouse gas emissions]]. Quoting an unnamed diplomatic source, the Financial Times Deutschland has said the EU is to provide “1-3 billion euro” in aid to developing countries over the next three years so they can fight the effects of climate change and allow climate change mitigation and adaptation.

{{HYS question right|Will a legally binding international treaty to cut CO2 emissions be agreed by COP15?}} 
The conference was accused of environmental hypocrisy for its substantial carbon footprint, including its extensive use of private jets and limousines. To reduce the conference's environmental and climate impact, the Danish government will not give gifts to participants. The money will be spent on climate scholarships called ''COP15 Climate Scholarships'', allowing 10-12 candidates to carry out 2-year climate related master’s programmes at Danish universities. Thousands of people are outside the conference building including groups such as Climate Justice Action, [[w:Friends of the Earth|Friends of the Earth]], [[w:Camp for Climate Action|Camp for Climate Action]], [[w:350.org|350.org]] and [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace]] calling for urgent action. The environmental group Friends of the Earth condemned what it called “undemocratic practices adopted by the Danish presidency of convening small and exclusive groups of countries before the Copenhagen meeting”. A draft negotiating text has been publicly released, but it is rumored that there is an “alternate” treaty document being developed by some large countries in the negotiations, including conference organizers. 

According to the [[w:Bali Road Map|Bali Road Map]],  the 15th Conference of the Parties to the [[w:United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (COP15) and the 5th Meeting of the Parties to the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]] (COP/MOP5) must agree to a framework for [[w:climate change mitigation|climate change mitigation]] beyond 2012. Heads of states and governments of 110 countries have announced that they will come to Copenhagen before the 18th of December in an attempt to seal a political global climate deal. If a deal is reached, the UN will aim at transforming it into a legally binding text to replace the [[w:Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]], as its regulations of emissions expire in 2012.

WHO: 36 million cured of tuberculosis in last fifteen years
{{date|December 8, 2009}}
{{Health}}The [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) has said that over the last fifteen years, some 36 million people have been cured of tuberculosis, and about 8-million [[w:tuberculosis|tuberculosis]] cases have been avoided.  The information is contained in the WHO’s 2009 Global Tuberculosis Control Report Update. The Direct Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) strategy was given credit for the success.

The report added, however, that millions of people still do not have access to high quality tuberculosis care.  The disease is second only to [[w:HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] in the number of people it kills each year.  About 1.8 million died of tuberculosis in 2008.
   
Dr. Mario Raviglione, director of the WHO’s Stop TB Department, is in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the release of the report. He commented that “what we are demonstrating with this new report is that on the one hand we have fairly good benefits from the investments in TB control over the last 10 to 15 years and at the same time [...] we have problems that persist and are possibly getting worse."

"I believe that there is little commitment in many countries to expand rapidly and urgently what needs to be done for MDR-TB.  Here we are dealing with a really serious urgent problem.  We are talking about a half a million cases…emerging every year,” he continued.

The WHO official noted that only a small percentage, perhaps six or seven percent, of MDR-TB cases are even detected. "Only half of them are properly treated," he says. “That to me is a tremendous delay and is a lack of [a] sense of urgency." Unless more is done, he predicted that there will be severe consequences.

“Multi-drug resistant TB is the most serious form of tuberculosis because it does not respond to the conventional treatment that we give to patients with TB.  The consequence is that we are just allowing this disease to spread unchecked in many parts of the world."

Danish unofficial draft version of UNCCC treaty leaks, G77 reacts sharply
{{date|December 10, 2009}}
{{United Nations}}
On the third day of the two-week [[:w:United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen, the leaders of developing countries said that EU and US emissions cuts plans are not enough.  After a Danish unofficial draft version of the future treaty leaked, they reacted with a demand of shift of emission cuts to developed world industries.

The host Danish government's draft version of a treaty was published by UK newspaper [[:w:The Guardian|The Guardian]] without the government's consent. The draft says that "developing countries, except the least developed which may contribute at their own discretion, commit to nationally appropriate mitigation actions". The quantitative consideration in it is that a 50% emissions cut globally (from 1990 levels) by 2050 should be achieved, with most industrialised nations implementing 80% cuts.
{{QuoteLeft|no developing nations are committed to emission cuts|4=Kyoto protocol}} Deputy Head of the Chinese delegation [[:w:Su Wei|Su Wei]] recalled the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which includes the statement "no developing nations are committed to emission cuts or sharing of funding for mitigation and adaptation in poor parts of the world". Su Wei said, "The EU position cannot be justified. The [Kyoto] protocol among other UNFCCC agreements stipulate clearly what developed and developing countries should do."

In an interview with [[:w:Politiken|Politiken]], a Danish daily broadsheet newspaper, the Chairman of [[:w:Group of 77|Group of 77]] commented on the event, mentioning the previous Denmark-Africa friendly political relations:
{{Q|You need to listen to all countries. That’s what democracy is about, and that’s what you have been cheering in Denmark. What Prime Minister (Lars Løkke Rasmussen) does is contrary to the spirit of the developing aid, which Denmark has provided for Africa through many years.}}
A member of poverty-focused charity, [[:w:Oxfam|Oxfam]], Antonio Hill commented to the BBC, speaking positively about the idea of transferring finance from industrialised to developing countries &mdash; to help them curb their emissions and help them protect against the impacts of climate change.  Antonio Hill said that otherwise industrialised nations had to offer considerably bigger cuts.  Commentators say the G77 block statements are substantially reasonable, since many of emissions sources are geographically located in developing countries, but owned by citizens of developed countries.

Executive secretary of the UNFCCC Yvo de Boer said the document had no weight at the conference:
{{Q|This was an informal paper ahead of the conference given to a number of people for the purposes of consultations. The only formal texts in the UN process are the ones tabled by the Chairs of this Copenhagen conference at the behest of the parties.}}
Head of the global climate initiative  [[w:World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wide Fund for Nature]] Kim Carstensen commented on the event, pledging not to to distract to the 'Danish text' and to concentrate on subsequent official actions at Copenhagen:
{{Q|The behind the scenes negotiations tactics under the Danish Presidency, have been focusing on pleasing the rich and powerful countries rather than serving the majority of states who are demanding a fair and ambitious solution. The Danish Prime Minister´s proposed text is weak and reflects a too elitist, selective and non-transparent approach by the Danish presidency.

We understand and share the frustration of the poor and vulnerable countries. We urge the Danish presidency to change its style and move to a cooperative and listening mode.

We also believe this was one of the political signals sent by COP President Connie Hedegaard in her opening statement yesterday.

Focus on the Danish text right now is a distraction from the negotiations that have just resumed for their final phase in Copenhagen. Talks must focus on the text that has so far been negotiated and not on new texts that are being negotiated in small groups.}}

UN: 4.8 million Ethiopians in need of food aid
{{date|December 11, 2009}}
{{Ethiopia}}The [[United Nations]] has estimated that about 4.8 million people in [[Ethiopia]] will need 529,148 tons of emergency food aid worth approximately US$270 million in the first half of next year.

"Despite the collaborative efforts of the government and humanitarian partners to address ongoing humanitarian challenges in Ethiopia, humanitarian needs are expected to remain," read a statement on the UN official website.

The UN's figure has decreased a bit from January's numbers, which suggested that 4.9 million people were in need of food aid in the country. In August, the UN's estimate went up to 6.2 million.

Ethiopia's current food crisis has been primarily caused by prolonged, heavy droughts, which have ruined crops, as well as higher food prices.

Thousands continue to flee fighting in Yemen
{{date|December 11, 2009}}

The [[United Nations]] refugee agency reports thousands of civilians continue to flee their homes in northern [[Yemen]] as [[w:Sa'dah insurgency|fighting]] between government troops and [[w:Houthis|Al Houti]] rebel forces enters a fifth month. The [[w:United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) says the situation in the [[w:Sa'dah Governorate|Saada province]] remains particularly tense as more people arrive there.
[[File:Sa'dah 01.jpg|thumb|left|The city of Sa'dah, 1986. {{Image credit|[[commons:User:Bjag|Bernard Gagnon]]}}]]
The U.N. refugee agency reports clashes have broken out in a number of districts in the Saada province as more people arrive. It says the situation in the Razeh district is particularly serious.

The UNHCR says the civilian population there faces restrictions of movement and lacks basic services such as electricity and water. It says shortages of food and other commodities are pushing prices up sharply and an increasing number of people cannot afford to buy what they need.

U.N. refugee spokesman Andrej Mahecic says the influx of huge numbers of people in neighboring Hajjah and Amran provinces is putting a strain on shelter and aid.
{{QuoteRight|There are now some 21,000 IDPs living in a camp initially designed to shelter up to 10,000 people|source=Andrej Mahecic}}
"Over the past month alone, the IDP [internally displaced people] population of al-Mazrak One camp in Hajjah governorate has doubled. There are now some 21,000 IDPs living in a camp initially designed to shelter up to 10,000 people and overcrowding is presently the top concern for us," he said. "At least some 500 families in al-Mazrak camp are sharing their tents, normally meant for one family, with one or two other households. We estimate another 1,300 families who are accommodated in 48 large communal tents in four transit areas of the camp, are presently waiting for allocation of a family tent."

The UNHCR reports overcrowding in the camp is hampering delivery of humanitarian services. The agency says it reached an agreement with Yemeni authorities this week to build a third camp. And, plans are underway to set up a camp that would potentially house some 7,000 people.

Mahecic says the number of IDPs settling with local populations outside the camps has increased as well. He says local communities are bearing the brunt of the continuing displacement in Yemen. He says aid agencies are looking at ways they can assist host families.

The U.N. refugee agency reports an estimated 175,000 people have been affected by the conflict in Yemen since 2004, including those displaced by the latest crisis.

Red Cross appeals for US$33 million in food relief for Zimbabwe
{{date|December 12, 2009}}
{{Zimbabwe}}The [[w:Red Cross|Red Cross]] has appealed for US$33.2 million worth of humanitarian aid to feed 222,035 hungry people in [[Zimbabwe]]. According to the institution, there are 2.8 million or so people in the country who are "food-insecure".

“The Red Cross is appealing for 38.4 million Swiss francs [US$33.2 million] to continue its emergency food operation until September 2010,” the Red Cross said in a statement on Friday.

Emma Kundishora, the secretary-general of Zimbabwe’s Red Cross, commented further on the appeal. “The group that we are targeting [222,035 people] is acutely vulnerable. This is a group affected by HIV and Aids. It is a group that is particularly poor, and because of this they are unable to access foreign currency to purchase food.”

The [[United Nations]] has asked for about $378 million worth of aid for Zimbabwe for 2010, some of it intended to help feed hungry people. The Red Cross said it would be giving out food aid in the country until next September.

Protesters arrested at climate change rally
{{date|December 13, 2009}}
{{United Nations}}
[[File:COP15 Logo.svg|thumb|left|140px|Copenhagen Summit Logo]]
Almost a thousand protesters at [[w:United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|The Copenhagen Climate Change Summit]] were  arrested yesterday for unruly conduct. Although most of the protests were peaceful, one group began destroying windows of nearby buildings.  Tens of thousands of protesters held multiple rallies throughout the [[Denmark|Danish]] capital. Marches have also formed in [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[w:Jakarta, Indonesia|Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] and [[The Philippines|the Philippines]].  One of the demonstrators, [[w:Nnimmo Bassey|Nnimmo Bassey]], of Friends of the Earth, summed the rallies with "Let's dance, sing and be happy, because power is in your hands,".

{{QuoteRight|"Let's dance, sing and be happy, because power is in your hands,"|4=Nnimmo Bassey|5=[[w:Friends of the Earth|Friends of the Earth]] chair}}
Protesters included actress [[w:Helen Baxendale|Helen Baxendale]], model [[w:Helena Christensen|Helena Christensen]] and former Irish president [[w:Mary Robinson|Mary Robinson]].  Baxendale was quoted "I think it's also important that people come and make their voices heard as well. I think, in the end, that's what will make real, positive change."

The Copenhagen Summit opened last Monday, and has representatives from nearly 190 nations to discuss caps on greenhouse gas emissions.  A draft proposal calls for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 50–90% by 2050 and 25–40% by 2020 for developed nations.

North Korean weapons seized in Thailand
{{date|December 13, 2009}}
{{North Korea}}
[[Portal:Thailand|Thai]] customs officials said today that they had intercepted a [[Portal:North Korea|North Korean]] cargo plane loaded with 35 tons (31 Mg) of "heavy weapons".  The [[w:Ilyushin Il-76|Ilyushin Il-76]] aircraft, registered in Belarus,  was stopped at [[w:Bangkok|Bangkok's]] Don Muang airport, after a tip from the [[Portal:United States|U.S.]] Government. The crew of four North Korean nationals (who have dual citizenship with [[w:Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]]) and one [[w:Belarus|Belarusian]] were arrested on site. 

Thai PM [[w:Abhisit Vejjajiva|Abhisit Vejjajiva]] said to ''The Times'': "They committed two crimes: firstly they gave false information about their cargo, and secondly that cargo was found to be weapons".  North Korea is banned from exporting or importing weapons under [[UN]] [[w:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874|Security Council resolution 1874]].  There is no comment at this time from the North Korean government.
[[File:Atlant Soyuz Ilyushin Il-76 Candid A, BIAP.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A similar Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft {{image|Jim Gordon}}]]
A report from the [[w:Xinhua News Agency|''Xinhua'' News Agency]] says that the cargo was en route to [[Ukraine]], while another report from ''[[w:CNN|CNN]]'' says it was headed to [[Sri Lanka]].  The pilot, Belarusian Mikhail Petukhou, told Thai officials after six hours of interrogation that he had no knowledge of the cargo or its origins.  He said that he and his crew members would "[only] provide other information in court."

The North Korea arms ban was first imposed in 2006, and strengthened in June, after North Korea tested ballistic missiles and nuclear devices. North Korea's annual profit from arms sales is estimated to be US$1 billion (€684m, [[w:Thai baht|Thai฿]]3.3t).

Africa makes first draft version of UNCCC treaty, with harder goals
{{date|December 14, 2009}}
{{United Nations}}
At the [[:w:United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[:w:Copenhagen|Copenhagen]], after four days of negotiations, [[Africa]] countries have made the first draft version of future possible treaty, to replace the [[:w:Kyoto protocol|1997 Kyoto protocol]]. Africa leaders demand 5% of GDP of developed world citizens to be given as a finance to developing countries for struggle with global warming. Along with this, developing countries expect rich countries to increase their emissions cuts goals.

Funding for developed countries was previously expected to be 130 billion US dollars. The new proposal is about 11 times larger, according to 2008 GDP estimates. In an interview in Copenhagen, China’s representative [[:w:Su Wei|Su Wei]] commented, "The developed countries need to speed up the process and come forward with more ambitious targets by 2020."

{{HYS question left|Can you give 5% of your income for developing countries to fight with climate change?}}Many nations offered emissions cuts pledges, which vary from 4% to 17% cuts by 2020, compared with 1990 levels. The Africa's draft proposes a goal of 65% cut for every developed country. Though the new goals are harder, [[:w:Anders Turesson|Anders Turesson]], European Union representative at UNCCC, doubted in the ability of them to prevent 2-degree warming. In an interview in Copenhagen, he said, "We are concerned about the environmental integrity of these texts and we do not see how they will deliver the 2-degree target. Hopefully we will be able to step up our ambitions as we move forward in the negotiations."

British Energy and Climate Change Secretary [[:w:Ed Miliband|Ed Miliband]] criticised the draft text for absence of a certain temperature raise threshold, said that the new texts "are shorter texts than we’ve had before, which we can negotiate around because the imperative here is to get on with it and get to an ambitious solution".

[[:w:Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg news company]] interviewed several people from New York environmental group [[:w:Natural Resources Defense Council|Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC). Its policy director David Doniger expects most difficulties to come at the end of the UNCCC, when [[:w:Barack Obama|Barack Obama]] and [[:w:Wen Jiabao|Wen Jiabao]] arrive at the summit: "It’s really come down to a set of difficult issues. It’s a lot easier for lower-level negotiators to come to an impasse and go home. It’s not easy for senior officials and definitely not easy for heads of government." As international climate policy director of NRDC Jake Schmidt commented similarly, "It’s going to be a tense negotiation over emissions cuts for developed countries."

WHO: Polio reemerging in Africa
{{date|December 15, 2009}}
{{Health}}The [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) said earlier today that [[w:polio|polio]] has reemerged in several countries in [[Africa]]. WHO Africa regional director Luis Gomes Sambo made the announcement at the beginning of a [[Zimbabwe]] conference regarding child immunisation.

"Several polio-free countries have suffered setback in polio eradication. The number of countries with polio outbreaks following wild poliovirus importations has increased from thirteen to nineteen in 2009," Sambo commented.

He also added that "we need better management of the available resources for immunization, human resources, technologies and we need increased funding to improve the capacity of governments to purchase vaccines and we need also greater mobilization of people. We need to inform people that to bring their people to vaccination campaigns."

The Zimbabwe conference takes place at a time when there has been a considerable decline of under-five mortality in the region. Sambo, however, said that sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 51% of all under-five deaths globally in 2008. At this rate, he noted, Africa cannot achieve the fourth UN Millennium Development Goal to reduce under-five mortality rate by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015.

The countries that have had increases in polio included [[Angola]], [[Chad]], and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The WHO attributed the rise mostly to lack of immunisations. The agency estimates that 75% of children on the continent receive vaccines, and has said it will try to raise the number to 85%.

Copenhagen climate conference ends with "meaningful agreement"
{{date|December 19, 2009}}
[[File:Obama COP15 morning plenary session.jpg|thumb|left|President Barack Obama delivers remarks during a morning plenary session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference.{{image credit|Pete Souza}}]]
President of the [[United States]] [[Barack Obama]] has announced that wealthy and developing nations have reached what he called a "meaningful agreement" at the [[w:United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|UN Climate Change Conference]].  The announcement came in the final hours of two weeks of tough negotiations, but fell far short of what some had hoped for. 

Agreement came late in the evening and after a day of intense negotiations.
{{HYS question right|How do you feel about the outcome of the conference?}}
President Obama announced what he called a meaningful and unprecedented breakthrough. "For the first time in history all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change," he said.

Negotiations stalled amid differences over mitigation efforts by cutting greenhouse gas emissions; verification; and funding.

That formed the core of discussions, said Mr. Obama. "Throughout the day we worked with many countries to establish a new consensus around these three points, a consensus that will serve as a foundation for global action to confront the threat of climate change for years to come," he said.

Obama sat down with the leaders of developing countries at a multilateral meeting with Chinese Premier [[w:Wen Jiabao|Wen Jiabao]], Brazilian President [[w:Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]], Indian Prime Minister [[w:Manmohan Singh|Manmohan Singh]], and South African President [[w:Jacob Zuma|Jacob Zuma]].

The agreement requires countries to list actions they will take to cut gas emissions by specific amounts and allows for verification.

Obama noted in his speech, "And that's where we agreed to list our national actions and commitments, to provide information on the implementation of these actions through national communications, with international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines." Obama also added that the leaders "agreed to set a mitigation target to limit warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, and importantly, to take action to meet this objective consistent with science."

Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping, a Sudanese diplomat who acted on behalf of the [[w:Group of 77|Group of 77]] of developing nations blasted the agreement and the 2 degree mark stating to reporters, "The developed countries have decided that damage to developing countries is acceptable." On the 2-degree mark he stated the mark would "result in massive devastation to Africa and small island states." Mr. Di-Aping and various representatives of the most most vulnerable countries wanted a target of 1.5 degrees.

{{QuoteRight|Going forward we're going to have to build on the momentum that we've established here in Copenhagen to ensure that international action to significantly reduce emissions is sustained and sufficient over time. We've come a long way but we have much further to go.|4=US President Barack Obama}}
British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] called it a good first step, but said a binding treaty must follow. German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] also called it a first step and urged more action.  

President Obama acknowledged that as well, saying this progress had not come easily, and alone is not enough.  "Going forward we're going to have to build on the momentum that we've established here in Copenhagen to ensure that international action to significantly reduce emissions is sustained and sufficient over time.  We've come a long way but we have much further to go," he said.

The agreement is a far cry from what environmentalists and developing nations had called for. They wanted a legally binding treaty with much more specific commitments.

Some environmental groups criticized the agreement. Kim Carstensen of the [[w:World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund]] spoke of a non-deal that is not fair and does not meet the demands of the developing world. "It's been cooked up by a number of big countries in a closed room, without any transparency, without any civil society engagement in this building (the conference), without much engagement of the vulnerable countries," she said.

Climate talks are to continue. [[Germany]] is to call a meeting on the issue in the coming months and a climate change summit is also expected to be held in [[Mexico]] within the coming year.

[[China]] and [[Indonesia]], two of the giants of [[Asia]], have welcomed the [[w:United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|UN Climate Change Conference]] outcome. 

The Chinese foreign minister and [[:w:Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono|Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], the [[:w:6th President of Indonesia|6th President of Indonesia]], appreciated the result of the [[:w:United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|UN Climate Change Conference]]. [[Obama]] defended the [[:w:Copenhagen Accord|Copenhagen Accord]] and was the [[:w:medium|medium]] between the main new powers. The consensus didn't adopt the accord in the Copenhagen summit.

The 193-nation conference ended last Friday in [[:w:Denmark|Denmark]]. Richard Black, who is a journalist of [[:w:BBC|BBC]] environment says the [[:w:tipping point|tipping point]] is the 2 degrees Celsius. The [[:w:UN|UN]] scientists says to avert the [[:w:climate crisis|climate crisis]] we have to stay under 3.6F (2C).

[[:w:Yang Jiechi|Yang Jiechi]], who is the 10th [[:w:Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China|Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China]] said: "Developing and developed countries are very different in their historical emissions responsibilities and current emissions levels, and in their basic national characteristics and development stages. [...] Therefore, they should shoulder different responsibilities and obligations in fighting climate."

Yang Jiechi thinks the summit was the beginning of a new chapter fight against of global warming. [[:w:IPCC|IPCC]]'s leader, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with [[:w:Al Gore|Al Gore]] [[:w:Rajendra Pachauri|Rajendra Pachauri]] said "We will have to make sure it moves quickly".

The [[w:United Nations Climate Change Conference 2010|UN Climate Change Conference]] will be organized in [[:w:Bonn|Bonn]], Germany. There will be other Climate and Atmosphere conferences in the future, for example the [[:w:Fortaleza|Fortaleza]] conference in Brazil, which start [[:w:16 August|16 August]] 2010. 

The Copenhagen Accord is based on a proposal tabled by [[US]], [[China]], [[:w:India|India]], [[Brazil]] and [[South Africa]].

U.N. pulls out of southern Somalia
{{date|January 8, 2010}}
{{Somalia}}
[[File:Somali children waiting.JPEG|thumb|250px|left|Somali children waiting to receive food aid.]]
[[File:Somali girls with food aid.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Two Somali girls with [[United States]] food aid.]]

With violence against foreigners escalating daily, and after being deluged with various threats and demands from [[w:al-Shabaab|al-Shabaab]], a radical Islamic militant group with ties to [[w:al-Qaeda|al-Qaeda]], the [[United Nations]] [[w:World Food Programme|World Food Programme]] announced on Tuesday that, as of the end of this week, they are going to suspend all of their operations within southern [[Somalia]]—including the distribution of desperately needed food aid to Somali civilians. This is now the third humanitarian agency, after [[w:CARE International|CARE International]] and [[w:Doctors Without Borders|Doctors Without Borders]], to evacuate from the war-torn nation. 

The pull out, which will include the closing down of all UN offices and the withdrawal of all local staff, is going to effect over one million Somalis—many of whom relay on this food program for their daily meals. 

When asked by the New York Times to further explain the UN's decision, Peter Smerdon, a spokesperson for the program, said via telephone from [[w:Nairobi|Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], "In the past few weeks there has been a harder line of unacceptable demands and conditions set by armed groups (such as al-Shabaab) in these areas. We sadly had to make the decision to pull our staff out."

Smerdon also cited the fact that over forty aid workers have been killed between January 2008 and September 2009, and that four volunteers still remain in the hands of their captors.

Furthermore, when asked how this move by the UN will effect the Somali people, Smerdon said simply, "People will go hungry...you could see malnutrition rates rising [as a result]." When asked by a British newspaper, The Morning Star, the same question, another program representative, Emilia Casella, conveyed like sentiments, "[Those] dependent on food assistance in southern Somalia face a situation that is particularly dire."

In a nation that—due to civil war—has not had a functioning government in over two decades, Islamic extremists groups—such as al-Shabaab—as well as various warlords and pirate gangs control most of the Horn of Africa nation, except for its besieged capital, Mogadishu, which is protected by African Union and NATO troops in addition to UN peacekeepers.

According to the UN, al-Shabaab—which has direct influence over the area that is going to be effected—presented their offices with numerous lists of demands. Among their demands was that the UN pay Shabaab a $20,000 protection fee every six months, seek Shabaab approval for all their projects, fire their entire female staff, and run their operations according to the militant group's schedule. 

When asked by The [[Associated Press]] about the UN's decision to leave southern [[Somalia]]—including his own town of Jilib—Somali civilian and father of eight children, Abdullahi Awnur, said that al-Shabaab is responsible for driving the UN food program away, and that what they are doing is "indirect[ly] killing" innocent people.

Awnur went on to say, "We have been forced to flee from our houses and depend on [UN] food aid, and now that it is finished, that means [al-Shabaab] here does not want us to live."

Despite all that has been said, al-Shabaab spokesperson, Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage, told ''[[w:New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporters that he found these claims to be "baseless" in their origins. He continued by stating that, "All we (al-Shabaab) ordered them (the UN) was to buy food from Somali farmers and distribute it. They (the UN) do not want to do that, and because of that, they have made this very ridiculous justification." Nevertheless, the UN has noted that even when harvests were good, Somali farmers are only able to supply 30-40% of the food needed to sustain the bulk of the country's population. 

"[Somalia] has been described as the most complex emergency in the world, and perhaps the most dangerous to operate in. However, the world is not hearing this," say David Gilmour director of CARE International's Somali branch.

UNHCR: 200,000 people displaced by violence in Yemen
{{date|January 12, 2010}}
{{Yemen}}The [[United Nations]] High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said that 200,000 people in [[Yemen]] have been displaced by ongoing violence, and that the growing number of refugees is straining the ability of aid agencies to shelter and care for those forced to flee their homes.

The refugee agency reports that thousands of civilians in north Yemen are fleeing to neighboring provinces in a desperate search for safety, shelter and assistance, 
as the current wave of fighting between the government and the al-Houthi rebel group is entering its sixth month. It added that it is fast running out of space and money to care for them.  

"We now estimate that some 200,000 people have been displaced by the conflict in Yemen since 2004, including those displaced by the latest escalation which erupted in early August last year," said UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic.

"These newly displaced people bring stories of intense clashes in Razeh, Saqain and Sahar districts and report dozens of civilian casualties as a result of air strikes and heavy fighting," Mahecic added, as quoted by [[w:Voice of America|Voice of America]]. "UNHCR is not present in the conflict area and has no independent confirmation of these reports.

"We now estimate that some 200,000 people have been affected by the conflict in Yemen since 2004, including those displaced by the latest escalation which erupted in early August last year," he continued.

The spokesman noted that camps for the displaced are stretched to capacity, and aid resources are quickly becoming depleted. [[w:News24|News24]] reports that one camp at Al Mazrak in the Hajjah province is now home to 21,000 people, double its intended capacity, and others were also being populated quickly and in dire conditions.

"The shelter situation is equally dire in Amran province where most of the arriving IDPs are staying with host families or renting places.  Over the New Year's week alone, more than 5,000 IDPs arrived to Amran City," Mahecic said.  "The acute lack of shelter and accommodation is creating tensions between the displaced and the local population.  In the absence of an immediate and feasible camp option, UNHCR is planning to set up a transit center in Amran as an interim and temporary solution," he concluded.  

The UN has issued a US$177-million appeal on behalf of all UN agencies working in Yemen; so far, less than one percent of that has been received.

Details emerge in Haiti earthquake; thousands feared dead
{{date|January 13, 2010}}
{{2010 Haiti earthquake}}A massive earthquake, registering 7.0 on the {{w|moment magnitude scale}}, struck [[Haiti]] yesterday, destroying many buildings, disrupting communications, and burying an unknown number of people underneath rubble. Thousands of people are feared to have been killed by the tremors, which were felt as far away as [[Venezuela]].
[[File:Haiti-injured-in-rubble.jpg|200px|thumb|left|An injured survivor in the Port-au-Prince rubble. {{image credit|[http://twitter.com/bluecorp bluecorp] - Twitter}}]]
[[File:Haiti-survivor-evac.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Survivors from the rubble being loaded on the back of a pickup truck. {{image credit|[http://twitter.com/bluecorp bluecorp] - Twitter}}]]
[[File:Haiti-dead-in-streets.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Corpses of people killed by collapsed buildings were scattered throughout Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas. {{image credit|[http://twitter.com/bluecorp bluecorp] - Twitter}}]]
Witnesses say bodies were lining the streets of the capital, {{w|Port-au-Prince}}, after the quake struck on Tuesday afternoon, sending a cloud of dust from falling buildings into the sky. The quake was centered about sixteen kilometers from the capital, and struck at a depth of just ten kilometers, exacerbating the damage. At least 27 aftershocks were also recorded, the strongest of which came in at 5.5 and 5.9 magnitude. A tsunami alert was initially issued following the tremor, but it was retracted shortly afterwards.

Buildings across the capital have collapsed, including the presidential palace and the headquarters of the [[United Nations]] peacekeeping mission in Haiti. However, the president, {{w|René Préval}}, and his wife reportedly survived the collapse of the building. The country's envoy to the [[United States]] believed damage costs could reach billions of dollars.

UN peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy said many people were in the UN building when it went down and they remain unaccounted for. A Brazilian military official later said four [[Brazil|Brazilian]] soldiers who were part of the UN mission were killed.

UN Peacekeeping Chief Alain LeRoy said the organisation is working to learn the fate of its personnel. "As we speak there are still over 100 people unaccounted for under the rubble.  We do not know about their fate [...] some people have been extracted out of the building - but only less than 10 for the time being.  Some dead, some alive. So we do not know for the time being the fate of the others. But of course, we are extremely, extremely concerned."

The {{w|Port-au-Prince Cathedral|Notre Dame of the Assumption Cathedral}} in Port-au-Prince was also destroyed, killing {{w|Joseph Serge Miot}}, the {{w|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of  Port-au-Prince|Archbishop of Port-au-Prince}}.

"[...] It would appear that all those who were in the building, including my friend [UN mission head] Hedi Annabi [...] and all those who were with him and around him are dead," said [[France|French]] Foreign Minister {{w|Bernard Kouchner}}. In a statement released yesterday, the UN remarked that "[f]or the moment, a large number of personnel remain unaccounted for."

=== 'Total chaos' ===

Hospitals in Port-au-Prince were reported to have collapsed, raising fears that the injured would not be able to receive treatment easily. "We have reports of some of the most important hospitals in Port-au-Prince have been severely impacted by the earthquake," said Paul Conneally, the Head of Media for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

[[File:Haiti-quake-homevideo.ogv|thumb|right|240px|Video of the earthquake in progress. {{image credit|YouTube user nicbensette}}]]"I saw dead bodies, people are screaming, they are on the street panicking, people are hurt. There are a lot of wounded, broken heads, broken arms," recounted Raphaelle Chenet, the administrator of the {{w|Mercy and Sharing}} charity, in a telephone interview with the ''{{w|Wall Street Journal}}'' from the Haitian capital.

UN officials reported that communications and power are out across the city, making it difficult to get accurate details regarding the full extent of casualties and damage.

The UN also noted that the main prison in Port-au-Prince collapsed, and there were reports of inmates escaping. Spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs, however, said she had no further details about that.

Efstathios Daras, the [[Greece|Greek]] ambassador to Venezuela who also represents Greece in Haiti, described the situation. "We fear major loss of life, maybe in the thousands or tens of thousands. Survivors are using their hands to help get trapped people out. There are fears of big aftershocks which could make the situation even worse. There is huge damage to the infrastructure. We can't get through anymore. All phone lines are down."
{{QuoteLeft|The world is coming to an end.|4=Woman filming the Haiti quake}}
Joseph Guyler Delva, a reporter for {{w|Reuters}}, was in the area when the tremors struck. "Everything started shaking, people were screaming, houses started collapsing. It's total chaos."

Rachmani Domersant, an employee for Food for the Poor charity described the conditions on Port-au-Prince's streets. "The whole city is in darkness, you have thousands of people sitting in the streets, with nowhere to go. I've seen seven to eight buildings, from office buildings to hotels and shopping stores, collapsed [...] I think hundreds of casualties would be a serious understatement."

President Rene Preval told the Miami Herald today that the aftermath of the disaster was "unimaginable". "Parliament has collapsed. The tax office has collapsed. Schools have collapsed. Hospitals have collapsed  [...] There are a lot of schools that have a lot of dead people in them," he said, adding that he believes thousands of people died.

=== 'Disaster of major proportion'; appeals for aid and international response ===

[[Image:2010 hispaniola shake map.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Map indicating the strength of the quake, with redder areas being harder hit. The star indicates the epicentre.]]The Red Cross in Geneva says that up to 3 million people have been affected. The international aid agency added that there is an urgent need for search and rescue volunteers as well as field hospitals, emergency health, water purification and telecommunications.

The {{w|World Food Program}} (WFP), which has a large staff on the ground, says the level of destruction indicates many of these people have been affected and will require help. The Director of the WFP office in Geneva, Charles Vincent, remarked that the first priority is to save lives. "To rescue people that are buried, that are trapped, etc. [...] followed very rapidly by a big problem of water, sanitation, epidemic-problems of diseases that might be bred in that kind of situation," he noted.

The Haitian ambassador to the United States, Raymond Joseph, told {{w|CNN}} the {{w|Caribbean}} nation is seeking US assistance, and called the quake a catastrophe of major proportions. "I'm quite sure we're going to face a disaster of major proportion," he said.

Separately, the {{w|Inter-American Development Bank}} said it will immediately approve a $200,000 grant for emergency assistance to Haiti. The funds will be used to provide food, water, medicine and temporary shelter for victims of the massive quake.

The {{w|United States Agency for International Development|US Agency for International Development}} is dispatching a disaster assistance response team to Haiti and commented that it will continue to provide additional support as needed.
{{QuoteRight|I'm quite sure we're going to face a disaster of major proportion|4=Raymond Joseph, Haitian ambassador to the US}}
The UN, meanwhile, dispatched approximately 37 search and rescue teams to assist Haitians from a global network. UN General Secretary [[Ban Ki-moon]] said that US$10 million worth of emergency funds would be used. "I have spoken with Mr. Clinton and we have agreed to mobilize our best assistance and rescue teams and try to reconstruct the Haitian economy. The UN will do whatever possible to help the Haitian people to overcome these difficulties," Ban stated.

Ban noted that 3,000 UN peacekeepers were in Haiti, and that they secured the seaport and airport. They are trying to rescue people buried underneath rubble, he said, but were severely hampered by lack of heavy equipment. "Brazilian forces have been working through the night to rescue but because of the darkness and destruction of infrastructure not much progress has been made. We hope it will be better this morning," Ban said.

The aid group {{w|Oxfam}} added that its emergency response team for {{w|Latin America}} is based in Haiti and is well prepared, with a public health, water and sanitation team in Port-au-Prince. Oxfam says it is preparing to send in emergency supplies as soon as possible from [[Panama]].

The American Red Cross pledged US$500,000 to help the country, and would send out people to assess damage. "As with most earthquakes, we expect to see immediate needs for food, water, temporary shelter, medical services and emotional support," it said yesterday evening in a statement.

A number of other nations, including the [[UK]] and [[Venezuela]], are also planning to send aid.

{{HYS question left|Did you feel the earthquake? Were you affected by it in some way?}}A reporter for the {{w|Al Jazeera}} news agency, however, said there might be difficulties delivering aid. "We are about 300km from the epicentre of the earthquake, and we know that the UN agencies and the humanitarian groups here are trying to get together some kind of strategy to get aid over to Haiti. We know that there are trucks loaded with supplies ready to go but the difficulty is that no-one really knows how to get that aid to the people [effectively]."

This quake is said to have been the strongest in Haiti in over two hundred years; the last time an earthquake of comparable magnitude was recorded was in 1770.

Haiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.  Recent development efforts have suffered severe setbacks because of political violence, crime, corruption and natural disasters. Seventy percent of the population lives on the equivalent of less than US$2 per day.

Countries around the world send aid, help to Haiti
{{date|January 14, 2010}}
{{2010 Haiti earthquake}}Countries and organizations from around the world are sending aid and help to victims of the devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck [[Haiti]] on Tuesday, damaging many buildings. The death toll is currently unknown, but estimated to run into the tens of thousands of people.

[[File:Remarks by the President on Rescue Efforts in Haiti.ogg|thumb|left|200px|Remarks by President Barack Obama on rescue efforts in Haiti. (4:30)]]
[[US]] president [[Barack Obama]] said in a press conference that "I've directed my administration to launch a swift, coordinated and aggressive effort to save lives and support the recovery in Haiti."

Obama announced that aid from the US armed forces was coming to Haiti, noting, "Several Coast Guard cutters are already there providing everything from basic services like water, to vital technical support for this massive logistical operation."

Obama continued: "[...] today, I'm also announcing an immediate investment of $100 million to support our relief efforts.  This will mean more of the life-saving equipment, food, water and medicine that will be needed. This investment will grow over the coming year as we embark on the long-term recovery from this unimaginable tragedy."

Obama said that the US would forge partnerships with Haitian people and Haitian-Americans, along with [[United Nations]] peacekeepers. He closed by saying, "To the people of Haiti, we say clearly, and with conviction, you will not be forsaken; you will not be forgotten.  In this, your hour of greatest need, America stands with you. The world stands with you."
[[File:Haiti earthquake damage overhead.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A damage assessment photo above [[w:Port-au-Prince|Port-au-Prince]], Haiti, taken by the [[w:United States Coast Guard|United States Coast Guard]] on January 13, 2010.]]
The UN Secretary-General, [[Ban Ki-moon]] said that $10 million is being released from the international organization's central emergency response fund.

Meanwhile, the UN's [[w:World Food Programme|World Food Programme]] (WFP), which already has an existing operation in the country, is beginning to distribute high energy biscuits which require no preparation before eating. On top of that, the WFP is airlifting 86 metric tons of food from their emergency hub in [[El Salvador]].

A spokesperson for the WFP said, "In a normal day the World Food Programme will be feeding one or two million people in Haiti — and now we need to do even more, because the people have lost everything."

[[China]] is also pledging aid to the country, despite the lack of official diplomatic ties between the two countries. Haiti recognizes the Republic of China, better known as [[Taiwan]]. Nevertheless, China has sent a 60 member search and rescue team to Haiti and the Chinese Red Cross is donating one million dollars in emergency aid.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu said her country expresses sympathy to the Haitian government and people. Jiang says the Chinese foreign minister has sent a telegram of condolence to his Haitian counterparts.

An 80 member team from the [[United Kingdom]] of search and rescue specialists has arrived in Haiti to help in efforts there. British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] said in a joint press conference with Toaiseach of [[Ireland]] [[w:Brian Cowen|Brian Cowen]] that the team has arrived in the country. He also announced that the government is pledging to match the UN's [[w:United States dollar|US$]]10 million ([[w:Pound sterling|£]]6.1 million). 
[[File:Haitian Port Damage1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Damage at the main habor of Port-au-Prince, as photographed by the US Coast Guard on January 13, 2010.]]
Brown said, “It is a tragedy beyond imagination and there is a deep sense of loss felt by the whole of the British and Irish people about the tragedy that individual families in Haiti are experiencing at the moment. We send our message of sympathy and support to the people of Haiti at this most difficult of times."

He added, “Where men, women and children are suffering under the heaviest of burdens, that place must, for that moment, become the centre of our world’s attention, the world’s compassion and the world’s humanitarian help.”

[[France]] is also sending aid to the French-speaking country, which at one time was a colony of France known as Saint-Domingue. France is sending two planes with rescuers and aid. Civil safety authorities in France are sending a team of 130 members consisting of rescuers, trained rescue dogs, doctors and nurses along with 12,000 tons of aid and rescue supplies.

[[Israel]] is sending rescue forces in two El Al planes carrying a 121-member delegation that includes 40 doctors, five search-and-rescue teams, and an army rescue squad. The IDF medical teams are preparing to spend two weeks in Haiti. 

[[Spain]] has pledged $4.3 million ([[w:Euro|€]]3 million) in aid money and has 150 tons of aid ready to be delivered.

[[South Africa]] is sending a team of search and rescue specialists to Haiti in response to the devastating earthquake on Tuesday.  It is the first of several teams being sent by a local civic group.
 
The head of South Africa's Gift of the Givers Foundation, Emtiaz Sooliman, says his group is sending up to three teams of search and rescue specialists to Haiti to help victims of the earthquake and hopefully save some lives.

"These are people who have worked with building collapses, urban search and rescue and some of them have been involved in responding to previous earthquakes so they are highly skilled," he said.

Sooliman says a second team is to depart as soon as he can book a flight for it.

Haiti relief efforts: in depth
{{date|January 15, 2010}}
{{2010 Haiti earthquake}}[[Image:Downtown Port au Prince after earthquake.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An aerial view of downtown Port-au-Prince. Only a few buildings remain fully intact; most have been either completely leveled or damaged.]][[Image:Haiti camp.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A makeshift camp set up by the [[Brazil]]ian army in Port-au-Prince to help the disaster victims]][[Image:Haiti earthquake camp.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Another picture of the Brazilian camp]]Countries and relief organisations around the world are sending aid to [[Haiti]], which was hit by a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on Tuesday, affecting up to three million people, most of them in the capital, [[w:Port-au-Prince|Port-au-Prince]]. Relief efforts, however, have been hampered by damaged or destroyed infrastructure, lack of shelter, and communications difficulties.

As of today, at least 300,000 people were estimated to be homeless in the capital, according to the [[United Nations]]; the organisation reports that one in ten buildings completely collapsed due to the tremors and resulting aftershocks. The UN said it believes 45,000 to 50,000 people were killed by the quake, while Haitian President [[w:Rene Preval|Rene Preval]] said that seven thousand bodies were buried in a mass grave.

Port-au-Prince's main airport remained open as of today, and relief airplanes were arriving faster than they could be unloaded, prompting fears that planes could run out of fuel while waiting their turn to land. As a result, all non-military flights out of the airport were restricted. Air traffic controllers from the [[US]] were present to help handle the flow.

The main port, meanwhile, was severely damaged, and unable to handle any cargo.

To see more images related to the disaster, you may wish to look at the companion article '''[[Haitian earthquake: in pictures]]'''.

=== 'Logistical challenge', looting problems ===

Even with the amount of aid coming in, it is proving difficult to deliver it where it is needed; many roads have been blocked by rubble. Alejandro Lopez-Chicheri, a senior spokesman for the [[w:World Food Programme|World Food Programme]] (WFP), commented: "The roads, many of them are still to be opened, and on the ones that are open there are still people concentrated on the sides of the roads." He described Haiti as being "completely on the ground".

"This is a logistical challenge. Before the earthquake struck we were already assisting one million people here, we are considering it will be at least double that after this earthquake," he told the [[w:Al Jazeera|Al Jazeera]] news agency.

The WFP has estimated that two million people will need food aid; however, only four thousand have so far been fed.

[[Image:Haitian Port Damage1.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Port-au-Prince's harbour was too damaged to receive cargo; aid had to go through the airport instead.]][[Image:Haiti earthquake aftermath tent city.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Impromptu tents set up amid the rubble of damaged buildings]]"The physical destruction is so great that physically getting from point A to B with the supplies is not an easy task," said a WFP spokeswoman in Geneva at a news conference.

Transporting supplies was made even harder due to lack of communications. Telephone lines were down. "There have been a lot of criticism from local authorities about the relief efforts, but in all fairness, if we could catch a break and get some communication up and running, things would go a lot faster," commented Louis Belanger, spokesman with the humanitarian aid group [[w:Oxfam International|Oxfam International]].

Looting has also been an issue. Delfin Antonio Rodriguez, the rescue commander from adjacent [[Dominican Republic]], said to the [[w:Agency France-Presse|Agency France-Presse]] news agency earlier today that "[o]ur biggest problem is insecurity. Yesterday they tried to hijack some of our trucks. Today we were barely able to work in some places because of that."

Elisabeth Byrs, a UN humanitarian spokeswoman in Geneva described the desperation of those in the capital. "People who have not been eating or drinking for almost 50 hours and are already in a very poor situation. If they see a truck with something, or if they see a supermarket which has collapsed, they just rush to get something to eat."

The WFP initially reported that its warehouses in the capital were looted, but this was later retracted. WFP spokeswoman Caroline Hurford told the BBC that "[a]pparently there were unconfirmed reports of looting taking place but once our teams got down to the dockside they were able to see that there was some mistake."

The earthquake also destroyed Port-au-Prince's main prison. According to International Red Cross spokesman Marcal Izard, 4,000 inmates escaped the jail and are now on the city streets. "They obviously took advantage of this disaster," he said.

Haitian police were "not visible at all," according to a UN spokesman, probably because they had to deal with lost family members and homes, further exacerbating the situation. Around 3,000 international UN peacekeeping troops were present to try to maintain law and order in lieu of the local police force.

==='Angry and impatient'; increasing frustration over lack of aid ===

{{HYS question left|Are you in Haiti? Have you been affected in some way by this disaster?}}According to a reporter for Al Jazeera, frustration among Port-au-Prince's residents was increasing because they were not receiving enough help, and there was an exodus out of the city to try and find areas with more supplies. "A lot of people have simply grown tired of waiting for those emergency workers to get to them," said Sebastian Walker. "Thousands of people are streaming out of the city towards the provinces to try to find supplies of food and water, supplies that are running out in the city."

A spokesman for the Brazilian-commanded UN peacekeeping force, David Wimhurst, also commented that "unfortunately, they're slowly getting more angry and impatient. I fear, we are all aware that the situation is getting more tense as the poorest people who need so much, are waiting for deliveries. I think tempers might be frayed."

Photographer Shaul Schwarz for the TIME magazine reported seeing at least two roadblocks downtown, made of rocks and corpses. "They are starting to block the roads with bodies. It's getting ugly out there. People are fed up with getting no help," he said.

"We hear on the radio that rescue teams are coming from the outside, but nothing is coming," said one resident, Jean-Baptiste Lafontin Wilfried, as quoted by the BBC.

"We need food. The people are suffering. My neighbors and friends are suffering," said another resident, Sylvain Angerlotte, aged 22, as quoted by the [[w:Associated Press|Associated Press]]. "We don't have money. We don't have nothing to eat. We need pure water." 

Due to lack of buildings or shelter, many relief members were facing the same difficulties as were residents. "Even the aid workers themselves are sleeping in cars or in tents on the streets," said Jamieson Davies, the international programmes director of the [[w:Caritas|Caritas]] relief organisation, to Al Jazeera. She described the situation as being "extremely difficult".

According to UN report, bribes cost Afghans US$2.5 billion per year
{{date|January 20, 2010}}{{Afghanistan}}
[[File:Hamid Karzai in February 2009.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Afghan President [[w:Hamid Karzai|Hamid Karzai]] in 2009]]
According to a newly-released report compiled by the [[w:United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)]], bribes paid to police, military, and public officials over the past year have cost [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] civilians collectively over US$2.5 billion, nearly the equivalent of a quarter of the country's legitimate [[w:GDP|GDP]]. 

Entitled "Corruption in Afghanistan", the report was based on polling of approximately 7,600 people in cities and villages around the nation. According to the report, 59% of those surveyed said that government sanctioned corruption was a more pressing concern to them than insecurity (54%) or unemployment (52%).

The report adds that more than half the population had to pay out at least one bribe in 2009. Furthermore, in a country where the economic output is only $425 per person, the average bribe cost nearly $160. Three out of four bribes were paid in cash.

Another finding is that one in every three Afghans believed that bribery was just a normal part of society. That being the case, only 9% of those surveyed—for whatever reason—ever chose to report these type acts to the proper authorities. The reports go on to say that there is a widely-held perception among 54% of Afghans that foreign nations and [[w:Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]] are just in their country "to get rich."

The head of the UNODC, [[w:Antonio Maria Costa|Antonio Maria Costa]], said in a statement to the international media, "The Afghans say that it is impossible to obtain a public service without paying a bribe. Bribery is a crippling tax on people who are already among the world's poorest."

{{QuoteLeft|It's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Afghanistan, to stop money and trust disappearing down a big black hole. Corruption is the biggest impediment to improving security, development and governance in Afghanistan.|source=[[w:Antonio Maria Costa|Antonio Maria Costa]], Head of the [[w:United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|U.N. Office on Drugs & Crime]]}}
Costa went on to note that there is a "new caste of rich and powerful individuals who operate outside the traditional power and tribal structures and bid the cost of favors and loyalty to levels not compatible with the under-developed nature of the country. Criminal graft has become similarly monumental, perverse and growing and is having political, economic and even security consequences."

"It's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Afghanistan, to stop money and trust disappearing down a big black hole. Corruption is the biggest impediment to improving security, development and governance in Afghanistan." 

This report was released Tuesday, nine days before a scheduled international conference on Afghanistan in London. There, Afghan President [[w:Hamid Karzai|Hamid Karzai]] is expected to face criticism for his perceived passive stance on corruption from the coalition of nations—especially the [[United States]]—that have thousands of [[w:War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|troops committed to Afghanistan]] as part of the [[w:War on Terrorism|Global War on Terrorism]].

President Karzai was sworn in for a second five-year term last November after [[w:Afghan presidential election, 2009|a controversial and hard-fought election]] during which he was widely accused of various types of fraud. Nevertheless, he has staunchly defended his record on corruption, stating that the entire issue had been "blown out of proportion by Western media."

IPCC claims about Himalayan glaciers were not based on science
{{date|January 22, 2010}}
{{Climate change}}
Part of a major 2007 report by the [[w:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), which claimed that the glaciers in the [[w:Himalayas|Himalayas]] were likely to melt within thirty years, has been found to have not been based on scientific data.

The IPCC, a [[United Nations]] panel, admitted that the original claim was "poorly substantiated" and that "well-established standards of evidence were not applied properly" in the preparation of this section of the report. "The chair, vice-chairs, and co-chairs of the IPCC regrets the poor application of IPCC procedures", read a statement released by the panel. News reports have suggested that the claim originated in a 1999 article in the popular science magazine [[w:New Scientist|''New Scientist'']], and was picked up by the IPCC when it was quoted in a 2005 report by the [[:w:World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund]].
[[File:Glacial lakes, Bhutan.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Glaciers and glacial lakes in the Bhutan-Himalaya {{Image source|[[NASA]]}}]]

[[w:Jairam Ramesh|Jairam Ramesh]], [[India]]'s minister of [[w:Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Environment and Forests]], had criticized the estimate when the report was initially released. After the announcement, Ramesh reiterated his criticism and told ''[[w:The Times of India|The Times of India]]'': "The health of the glaciers is a cause of grave concern, but the IPCC's alarmist position that they would melt by 2035 was not based on an iota of scientific evidence."

According to ''[[w:The Times|The Times]]'' (UK), most glaciologists believe it would take hundreds of years to melt the Himalayan glaciers, with some doubting that it will ever happen. There is evidence of glaciers growing in the neighboring [[w:Karakoram|Karakoram]] mountain range.

Michael Zemp, of the [[w:World Glacier Monitoring Service|World Glacier Monitoring Service]] told [[w:CNN|CNN]] that, "There are simply no observations available to make these sorts of statements."

"The other thing is that the report says the glaciers are receding faster than anywhere else in the world. We simply do not have the glacier change measurements. The Himalayas are among those regions with the fewest available data", Zemp added. 

Nevertheless, the IPCC maintains that the melting of the glaciers is a concern to the region, which is home to over one billion people. It stands by its overall conclusion that "mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate throughout the 21st century, reducing water availability, hydropower potential, and changing seasonality of flows in regions supplied by meltwater from major mountain ranges."

The IPCC had recently come under fire during the [[w:2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], when selectively leaked [[w:Climatic Research Unit hacking incident|e-mails]], hacked from the [[w:University of East Anglia|University of East Anglia]], reportedly showed that some scientists were attempting to suppress findings by other climatologists that did not agree with their own findings.

Somali pirates threaten to kill British hostages in days
{{date|January 23, 2010}}
{{Piracy}}
[[File:Gulf of Aden map.png|thumb|left|250px|Location of the [[w:Gulf of Aden|Gulf of Aden]].]]
A middle-aged [[UK|British]] couple who have been held hostage by [[w:Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]] for more than three months said on Friday, in a telephone interview with [[w:ITN|ITN]], that their captors have threatened to kill one or both of them if a government ransom is not received "within four or five days."

Paul and Rachel Chandler disappeared on October 23, 2009, while in the [[w:Gulf of Aden|Gulf of Aden]] off the coast of [[Somalia]] while en route from the [[Seychelles]] to [[Tanzania]]. Their 38-foot yacht, the ''Lynn Rival'', was later found abandoned. Days later, pirates confirmed they were in fact holding the couple hostage within Somalia's borders. 

A spokeswoman for the [[w:Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] told media in a statement on Friday that the government's policy was to not "make or facilitate concessions to hostage-takers." She added, the Office is, however, still closely "monitoring the situation" and "doing everything it can" to secure the couple's safe release.

The Chandlers' captors have demanded a ransom payment of [[w:United States dollar|US$]]7 million ([[w:Pound sterling|£]]4.3 million), but the [[w:Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] has refused to pay it, in line with their policy.

On Friday, the pirates granted the Chandlers separate telephone interviews with UK-based media outlet ITN. According to the interviews, the couple pleaded for help and alleged that they have been "physically attacked," separated and "treated as a captive animal" in solitary confinement at the hands of their captors.

Rachel Chandler told ITN that "dying would actually be an easy way out" and how she wanted to see her husband "at least once before we die."

The validity of these threats are not known. According to ''[[w:The Hindu|The Hindu]]'', pirates often make empty threats of execution, but rarely harm the captives.

[[Piracy]] is especially rife in the waters near Somalia, a nation, due to an ongoing civil war, that has not had a functioning government in place since 1991. [[w:Islamic Extremism|Islamic extremist]] groups, such as [[w:al-Shabaab|al-Shabaab]], as well as various warlords and pirate gangs control most of the nation. The only exception is the besieged capital of [[w:Mogadishu|Mogadishu]], which is protected primarily by [[United Nations|UN]] peace-keepers and other foreign troops. 

According to the [[w:International Maritime Bureau|International Maritime Bureau]], there were 406 reported pirate attacks worldwide in 2009, compared to approximately 290 the year before. During both years, more than 50% of these incidents occurred off the coast of the [[w:Horn of Africa|Horn of Africa]].

Haiti rescue effort abandoned
{{date|January 23, 2010}}
{{2010 Haiti earthquake}}[[File:Downtown_Port_au_Prince_after_earthquake.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown [[w:Port-au-Prince|Port-au-Prince]] after the earthquake.{{image credit|[http://flickr.com/photos/37913760@N03 UNDP Global]}}]]
The [[United Nations]] has announced that the government of [[Haiti]] has put an end to its efforts to find and rescue buried survivors of the earthquake that hit the region eleven days ago. The announcement comes just a day after two people were found alive.

According to Elizabeth Byrs, the UN spokeswoman, 132 people have been rescued since the earthquake hit. The death toll, as of Friday, is estimated to be 110,000. It is thought that the chances of survival are so slim that it is not worth the resources required for a successful rescue operation. Byrs called the decision to end the rescue effort "heartbreaking", but added that it had been advised by experts.

Only yesterday, an 84-year-old woman was found—severely injured and dehydrated—in the rubble of her home, and Emmannuel Buso, aged 21, was rescued by an [[Israel]]i search team. He said that he was coming out of the shower when the earthquake hit, and survived ten days by drinking his own urine. There is currently no information on whether the Israeli team will also stop their rescue efforts.

Shortly after the announcement, a [[France|French]] rescue team reported that it was trying to save a man who is trapped under the ruins of a hotel and supermarket. They cannot yet see the man, who said that he saw the team's light, and that as many as five other people are trapped with him. The rescue team said that it could take two hours to rescue the man.

It is hoped that removing focus from the rescue operation will allow more money and effort to be diverted to the logistically difficult relief effort, which has already seen planes arriving at the now operational [[w:Port-au-Prince|Port-au-Prince]] airport at a rate of 150 per day and a [[United States]] Navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, moored outside the partly-operational seaport.

{{QuoteLeft|This is the most complex operation WFP has ever launched|source=[[w:Josette Sheeran|Josette Sheeran]], executive director of the World Food Program}}
At least 130,000 people have been relocated out of Port-au-Prince, say the UN, whose [[w:World Food Program|World Food Program]] has provided approximately 2 million meals to starving people and calls the current operation "the most complex operation WFP has ever launched".

The magnitude 7 earthquake is estimated to have made 1.5 million people homeless, and some estimations of the death toll rise as high as 200,000. More than 75,000 bodies have been recovered and buried in mass graves, while more remain in the streets waiting to be collected.

Haitian minister: Over 150,000 dead in capital after earthquake
{{date|January 25, 2010}}
{{2010 Haiti earthquake}}
[[File:Haitian look at a body pulled out from the rubbles of a school (12 january 2010).jpg|thumb|left|A Haitian killed in the quake]]
The [[Haiti]]an government Communications Minister states that over 150,000 people in {{w|Port-au-Prince}}, the country's capital, are confirmed dead from the recent magnitude 7.0 earthquake there.

Minister Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue commented that the figure is based on corpses found and collected in the city by a state company, CNE.

"Nobody knows how many bodies are buried in the rubble &mdash; 200,000, 300,000?  Who knows the overall death toll?" the [[Associated Press]] reports Lassegue as commenting.

Yesterday, the [[United Nations]] reported the Haitian government found 111,481 bodies recovered from rubble. Meanwhile, at least 75,000 corpses have been buried in mass graves. The government officially announced on Saturday that its search for survivors buried beneath buildings had ended; the focus is now on getting aid to survivors.

EU to send police officers to Haiti
{{date|January 26, 2010}}
{{2010 Haiti earthquake}}
The [[European Union]] has announced that it will send a police force consisting of up to 350 officers to [[Haiti]], following the recent magnitude 7.0 earthquake there, which is thought to have killed up to 200,000 people and left 1.5 million without homes.

"There is an agreement on a collective contribution of gendarmes," said a European diplomat to the [[w:Agence France-Presse|Agence France-Presse]] (AFP) news agency.

Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, commented: “All the countries which form part of the European police force are willing to participate; [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], and [[Romania]], are ready to offer personnel, each according to its capabilities. Together we will represent the EU in this role of guaranteeing the security and above all the arrival of the emergency aid which the Haitians’ need.”

According to AFP, the largest contributors to the force would be France and Italy.

The [[United States]], meanwhile, deployed 20,000 of its soldiers into the earthquake-ravaged country, whilst the [[United Nations]] says it will send out about 3,500 extra troops into the vicinity.

The EU has promised upwards of 400 million euros to help the victims of the Haiti earthquake.

UK cabinet minister Jack Straw ignored advice that Iraq invasion was illegal
{{date|January 27, 2010}}
{{Iraq}}[[File:Jack Straw meeting with Rumsfeld at Pentagon, May 19, 2005, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|File photo of Straw in 2005{{image credit|[http://www.defense.gov/photos/May2005/050519-D-9880W-029.html US Department of Defense]}}]]
[[w:The Iraq Inquiry|The Iraq Inquiry]] in [[w:London|London]] has revealed that [[United Kingdom]] justice secretary [[w:Jack Straw|Jack Straw]] ignored the advice of Sir Michael Wood, the Foreign Office's most senior legal adviser until his resignation in 2006, that the 2003 invasion of [[Iraq]] was illegal under international law. This is the first time that Wood has publicly expressed an opinion on the war.

Wood advised Straw, then [[w:Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]], that invading Iraq without the backing of the [[United Nations]] [[w:United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] in the form of a specific mandate—which the resolution the government used to support the war lacked—would "amount to the crime of aggression", to which Straw responded that he was being "dogmatic and international law was pretty vague". Wood disputes this, saying, "Obviously there are some areas of international law that can be quite uncertain. This, however, turned exclusively on the interpretation of a specific text and it is one on which I think that international law was pretty clear." 
{{QuoteRight|I considered that the use of force against Iraq in March 2003 was contrary to international law|source=Sir Michael Wood}}
He says that it was unprecedented for the government to ignore his advice, and told the inquiry that he "considered that the use of force against Iraq in March 2003 was contrary to international law," since the Security Council had not met to approve the use of force, nor to agree that Iraq was committing a "material breach" of existing disarmament resolutions. He believed that regime change was the reason for the British interest in the nation, and that it was not a valid reason for war. He told the inquiry, "I made it clear that, in my view, the draft that they were working toward did not authorize the use of force without a further decision of the Security Council". Recently declassified letters prove that Wood raised these concerns directly with Jack Straw. 

In one of these letters, dated January 24, 2003, Wood said that the "UK cannot lawfully use force in Iraq in ensuring compliance" with UN resolutions (including resolution 1441, which gave [[Saddam Hussein]] a "final opportunity" to comply with the UN's mandates on [[w:weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] by November 2002). In his reply, Straw "noted", but "did not accept" Wood's advice. Straw said he was "as committed as anyone to international law and its obligations". He also said that "it is an uncertain field. In this case, the issue is an arguable one, capable of honestly and reasonably held differences of view." He said he wanted a new UN resolution "for political reasons", but said that there was a "strong case" that existing resolutions would "provide a sufficient basis in international law to justify military action".
{{HYS_question_left|Do you think the war in Iraq was illegal?}}
Instead of following Wood's advice, government ministers used the advice of [[w:Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]], who was then the [[w:Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General for England and Wales]]. Goldsmith—who is scheduled to appear before the Inquiry this Wednesday—advised Straw that a second UN resolution would not be required to invade, based on a series of UN resolutions reaching back to the end of the [[w:Gulf War|Gulf War]], despite having told the prime minister—only then days before—to wait for another UN resolution, the passing of which they had pushed other Security Council members for in the weeks running up to the invasion. Wood makes it clear, however, that the final decision regarding the legality of war lay with the Attorney General, rather than with himself.

The inquiry, chaired by [[w:Sir John Chilcot|Sir John Chilcot]], was told that there were concerns about how the decision was made among the Foreign Office's senior legal advisors. [[w:Elizabeth Wilmshurst|Elizabeth Wilmshurst]], then Deputy Legal Adviser to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, resigned in protest only days before the invasion. She criticised the decision-making process for its lack of transparency, and called it "lamentable". She also called the fact that Goldsmith gave his opinion only days before the invasion "extraordinary".
{{QuoteRight|Michael Wood's statement is the final nail in the coffin of the case for a legal war|source=Ed Davey}}
Wood said that Straw had "often been advised things were unlawful and gone ahead anyway and won in the courts" when he was home secretary. Last week, Straw—when questioned by the inquiry—called the decision to support the war a "profoundly difficult political and moral dilemma", and said it was the "most difficult" decision of his entire career. [[w:Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] foreign affairs spokesman [[w:Ed Davey|Ed Davey]] called Wood's statement "the final nail in the coffin of the case for a legal war." He asks if the advice reached then prime minister [[w:Tony Blair|Tony Blair]] or [[w:Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]], "And if not, why not?"
{{QuoteLeft|the mistake in the war was not to do the reconstruction and plan it in the way that was necessary|source=Gordon Brown}}
Wood's statement is expected to cause problems for Tony Blair when he appears before the inquiry on Friday. The war has provoked protests, and much outrage among politicians who believe that Blair was wrong to support then [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]] by sending 45,000 British soldiers—179 of whom died in combat—to fight in Iraq. The Prime Minister at the time, Tony Blair, is due to appear before the inquiry on Friday, and Gordon Brown, the current prime minister, is scheduled before the general election (which is expected to occur in May). Brown said yesterday that he "think[s] the mistake in the war was not to do the reconstruction and plan it in the way that was necessary so that Iraq could recover quickly after Saddam Hussein fell," and is expected to come under fire from the inquiry, which he himself set up, for his role in the war.

UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith admits to changing mind over Iraq war
{{date|January 27, 2010}}
{{Iraq}}[[File:Ieagoldsmith.jpg|thumb|left|File photo of Lord Goldsmith in 2007{{image credit|[[w:User:Johnnyryan1|Johnnyryan1]]}}]]
Lord [[w:Peter Goldsmith|Peter Goldsmith]], the [[w:Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General for England and Wales]] before and during the 2003 invasion of [[Iraq]], has told [[w:the Iraq Inquiry|the Iraq Inquiry]] that he changed his mind about the legality of the invasion about one month before military action began.

During his six hour session of questioning, Goldsmith said that he changed his mind about whether a further [[United Nations]] resolution was needed to ensure that the invasion was legal. His testimony comes only a day after former foreign office legal advisor Michael Wood told the inquiry that his own advice, that a further resolution was required, was ignored in favour of Goldsmith's. Goldsmith's account was under scrutiny because he had consistently said that it would be "safer" if a further resolution were obtained—since it would have put the "matter beyond doubt and nobody could have challenged the legality"—before changing his mind and giving the "green light" only a month before the invasion. He said that he had "good reasons" for "ultimately reach[ing] a different view", and called his previous advice "too cautious". He based his support of the war's legality on a series of UN resolutions dating back to the end of the [[w:Gulf War|Gulf War]].

Until February 2002, he believed that a new resolution would be required, but he said today that—after discussions with US and UK diplomats—he realised that [[w:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441]] "revive[d]" the authority of the [[United Kingdom]] to use force, as outlined in previous resolutions. One of these was [[w:United Nations Security Council Resolution 678|United Nations Security Council Resolution 678]], which was passed in November 1990. It authorized "Member States co-operating with the Government of Kuwait ... to use all necessary means to uphold and implement [[w:United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_660|resolution 660]] (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area" against Iraq if [[w:Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein]] failed to give up his [[w:Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]. However, there has been debate about whether "all means necessary" included military force.
{{QuoteLeft|The prime minister made it clear that he accepted that it was for me to reach a judgement and he had to accept it.|source=Peter Goldsmith}}
He admitted that he had told then prime minister [[w:Tony Blair|Tony Blair]], as far back as 2002, that any justification for war other than a UN resolution (such as regime change or self defence) would be invalid. Goldsmith said, "I don't think it [the advice] was terribly welcome." However, he added, "The prime minister made it clear that he accepted that it was for me to reach a judgement and he had to accept it." Goldsmith agreed that he ignored the advice of other legal advisors, including Michael Wood (who spoke before the inquiry yesterday) and [[w:Elizabeth Wilmshurst|Elizabeth Wilmshurst]] (who resigned in protest days before the invasion), who both said that invading Iraq without a new UN resolution would amount to the "crime of aggression". Goldsmith claimed to have "paid great attention to what their views were," but added, "Ultimately I disagreed with the views they took."

He said that an "unequivocal" opinion was needed before the invasion, and that this was what he gave in March, having been unsure about the war's legality previously. He denied changing his mind only days before the invasion, as some have claimed, saying that he had advised the government that the war would be legal as far back as February, and that his advice was "consistent". He also called claims that he was pressured into changing his opinion "nonsense". He said that he "was ready to answer questions" and intended to debate the issue with the cabinet, but was told that they would read his advice before moving on to different issues. He said that the debate did not in fact take place – he told the inquiry that he believes cabinet ministers considered it to be "a slightly sterile exercise".

In his testimony, Goldsmith also criticised Jack Straw's response to Wood's advice, saying that, while ministers could "challenge" legal advice, Straw "appeared to be rebuking a senior legal adviser for expressing his own legal view" in a recently declassified letter. He was also concerned that the cabinet ignored, or was unaware of, the caveats included in his March advice on the war's legality, in which he said that "the safest legal course" would be to get a new resolution, despite a "reasonable case" being available based on existing resolutions. His advice warned the government that he was not "confident" that the case based on existing resolutions would stand up in court. Goldsmith also requested the declassification of documents relating to the war's legal status, which are available to the Iraq inquiry, but not to the public. [[w:Sir John Chilcot|Sir John Chilcot]], the chair of the inquiry, said that Goldsmith's "frustration is shared."

Chad calls for UN troops to withdraw
{{date|January 29, 2010}}
{{Chad}}Diplomats have said that [[Chad]] called on the [[United Nations]]' peacekeeping force to withdraw its civilians and soldiers from the country, and wants a timetable for the withdrawal.

"There is a [Chadian] political imperative for a withdrawal. It doesn't matter how long it takes, it will be a withdrawal," said an unnamed diplomat to the [[w:Reuters|Reuters]] news agency; diplomats say that the deployment of UN personnel was never fully accepted by the government, and that Chadian president [[w:Idriss Deby|Idriss Deby]] views their presence as an encroachment on their sovereign territory.

The UN has sent out a high-level team to Chad, for talks, although diplomats noted there wasn't any scope to renegotiate the organisation's mandate, which is due to expire on March 15. Chadian authorities said they had asked the UN not to renew the mandate. Some concerns have been raised that aid agencies would not be able to operate in Chad should the withdrawal take place.

{{QuoteLeft|There is no question of that [changing the mandate]. The Chadians are demanding a calendar for the retreat. It will not be long.|4=Anonymous diplomat}}"There is no question of that [changing the mandate]. The Chadians are demanding a calendar for the retreat. It will not be long," said another diplomat, who wished to remain anonymous.

The UN is mandated to have approximately 5,000 soldiers in Chad, although at the moment there are only 3,000, as the force is still deploying; it took over the peacekeeping role in the country from the [[European Union]] in 2009. Human rights groups say that about 200,000 refugees from [[Darfur]] in neighbouring [[Sudan]] are in the eastern part of the country, where they have faced violence from fighters. The UN was tasked with protecting those refugees.

UN peacekeeping forces are also present in the northern [[Central African Republic]] (CAR), as civilians there came under violence from local rebellions, as well as the larger regional conflict. According to a diplomat, the UN would have to withdraw from the CAR if it pulled out of Chad. "The UN can't operate in a country that doesn't want them. But it also means a withdrawal from CAR," he noted.

Haiti rescue efforts continue, but survivors face increasing insecurity
{{date|January 29, 2010}}
{{2010 Haiti earthquake}}The survivors from the recent 7.0 magnitude earthquake in [[Haiti]] are now facing increasing insecurity from human traffickers and convicts escaped from collapsed prisons, officials have cautioned, even as aid is flowing into the country. The acting head of the UN's Haitian mission, meanwhile, says that that full reconstruction could take several decades. As many as 200,000 people were killed by the tremors, which struck on January 12, and 1.5 million people have been left without homes.

[[Image:Downtown Port au Prince after earthquake.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Downtown Port-au-Prince after the earthquake {{image source|[http://www.flickr.com/photos/37913760@N03/4274634000 UNDP]}}]][[File:EscombrosBelAir5.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Debris in the city streets. {{image source|[http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/media/imagens/2010/01/19/190110MCA0847.jpg/view Agencia Brasil]}}]]Anthony Banbury, the deputy head of the UN mission in the earthquake-ravaged country, commented to the [[w:Agence France-Presse|Agence France-Presse]] (AFP) news agency that survivors queuing for aid sometimes turned violent. He commented that while the aid is vital for the country, "it can be a source of insecurity because it attracts big crowds and there can be disorder around food distribution."

"[It is] absolutely necessary that we get enough food, enough water, enough shelter for the people, and enough security. I don't think any of us are anywhere near being close to being satisfied, because so much more needs to be done," he added. "[We must] do things smart, as well as fast, and that's a big challenge for us now."

The Haitian national police chief, Mario Andresol, remarked that electricity blackouts resulted in "bandits [...] taking advantage to harass and rape women and young girls under the tents," adding that 7,000 inmates of prisons escaped after the quake. "It took us five years to apprehend them. Today they are running wild."

Further exacerbating the security situation was that the Haitian police force was largely crippled by the disaster, with hundreds of policemen either killed or missing.

"At night, people take things. But I don't have a problem. I don't have anything to steal." said one local resident, Omen Cola, to AFP.

{{QuoteLeft|At night, people take things. But I don't have a problem. I don't have anything to steal.|4=Local Haitian resident Omen Cola}}Child trafficking, meanwhile, is also an issue; it had been a chronic problem even before the earthquake. The Red Cross has started to register orphaned children, and temporarily sending some to orphanages for shelter, according to a senior advisor for the [[w:United Nations Children's Fund|United Nations Children's Fund]]  (UNICEF), Bo Viktor Nylund.

UNICEF press official Roshan Khadivi told the [[w:Xinhua|Xinhua]] news agency on Wednesday that "we are taking photos and filling in forms to get the children's full details on file. Experience has shown us that there is at least one family member left usually. UNICEF does not believe in institutionalization in orphanages. Children need to be connected with their communities." Khadivi noted that considering adoption would only be done if the child's parents are not found after several months.

Sixty orphaned children, meanwhile, were transported earlier by plane to [[Germany]], where they are to be adopted; six of them were hospitalised for fatigue and dehydration.

=== "Starting below zero"; rescue efforts continue ===

Edmond Mulet, the acting head of the UN mission for Haiti,  told the BBC that it could take decades to fully reconstruct the country, and any recent development had been negated by the quake. "I think this is going to take many more decades than only ten years, and this is an enormous backwards step in Haiti's development. We will not have to start from zero but from below zero," he said.

{{QuoteRight|[...] This is an enormous backwards step in Haiti's development. We will not have to start from zero but from below zero.|4=Edmond Mulet, acting head of the UN mission for Haiti}}Mulet, who is also the UN's assistant peacekeeping operations secretary-general, said that the aid logistics were a "nightmare". However, he said he believed the capacity to provide help was improving, saying: "All this is coming together right now. Every day you can see more and more Haitian national police on the ground, working with our troops and more and more water being distributed, so it's a matter of time and putting all these elements together," as quoted by the BBC.

[[Image:Haitian look at a body pulled out from the rubbles of a school (12 january 2010).jpg|thumb|left|190px|A body that was pulled out from underneath the remains of a school {{image credit|[http://www.flickr.com/people/37913760@N03 UNDP]}}]]According to the head, 200,000 heavy-duty tents had been ordered, to help people cope with the rainy season, which generally starts in May. "Of course, 200,000 family-sized tents - solid ones that can withstand a hurricane season - are not available in the market just like that, so they have to be made. It's going to take a few days and weeks before they can arrive, but all this is coming," Mulet noted.

The Haitian president, [[w:Rene Preval|Rene Preval]], earlier this week asked for 200,000 tents and 26 million ready-to-eat meals to be airdropped.

Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Ewing, commander of Canada's Disaster Assistance Response Team, meanwhile, was concerned whether there was enough management in relief operations. "Everyone is trying to help, but it's not as coordinated as it should be. We're not getting aid to where it needs to go as effectively as it should be," he told AFP.

Earlier this week, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, described the reconstruction process as being a "colossal work of reconstruction."

"In 30 seconds, we lost nearly 60 percent of our gross domestic product, because all of Haiti's resources were concentrated in a small area around our seat of government," he said. "We have to decentralise. It's the only way to be efficient. It's also the only way to avoid the same problems happening in Haiti again."

The UN, meanwhile, reports that international funding and aid pledges for the country have now surpassed US$2 billion worth.

Tony Blair tells Iraq Inquiry he would invade again
__NOTOC__
{{date|January 29, 2010}}
{{Iraq}}[[File:Blair June 2007.jpg|thumb|left|2007 file photo of Tony Blair. {{image credit|[[commons:User:Gryffindor|Gryffindor]]}}]]
[[Tony Blair]], former prime minister of the [[United Kingdom]], appeared before [[w:the Iraq Inquiry|the Iraq Inquiry]] today. He faced six hours of questioning, starting at 6:30 am, at the [[w:Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre|Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre]] in [[London]] concerning his role in the 2003 [[Iraq]] invasion. During the inquiry, Blair stood by his decision to invade, saying he would make the same decision again.

This is the third time Blair has given evidence at an inquiry into the [[Iraq War]], having already testified before the [[w:Hutton Inquiry|Hutton Inquiry]] and the [[w:Butler Review|Butler Review]], as well as participating in an investigation by the [[w:Intelligence and Security Committee|Intelligence and Security Committee]]. The Hutton Inquiry found that the government did not "sex up" the dossier on Iraq's [[w:weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]. The Butler Review uncovered "serious flaws" in pre-war intelligence, and this inquiry was set up by current prime minister [[Gordon Brown]] in order to "learn the lessons" of the war. [[w:Sir John Chilcott|Sir John Chilcott]], the inquiry chairman, began by stressing that Blair was not "on trial", but could be called back to give further evidence if necessary.

At the end of the session, Chilcott asked Blair if he had any regrets, to which Blair replied that he was "sorry" that it was "divisive", but said that invading was the right thing to do since he believes "the world is a safer place as a result." Blair said that the inquiry should ask the "2010 question", which refers to the hypothetical position that the world would be in if [[Saddam Hussein]] were not removed from power. He said that "today we would have a situation where Iraq was competing with Iran [...] in respect of support of terrorist groups".

=== Reasons for invasion ===

At the inquiry, the topics on which Blair was questioned included his reasons for invading Iraq.

At the time, he said that his reasons were based on a need to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction; however, interviews held later suggest that removing Saddam Hussein from power was his primary objective. Blair denies this, asserting that the need to dispose of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was the only reason for the United Kingdom's participation in the invasion. He explained that, in an interview with [[w:Fern Britton|Fern Britton]], he "did not use the words regime change", and, what he was trying to say was, "you would not describe the nature of the threat in the same way if you knew then what you knew now, that the intelligence on WMD had been shown to be wrong".

He said, despite no weapons of mass destruction being found by UN weapons inspectors, he still believes that Saddam Hussein had the means to develop and deploy them; "[h]e had used them, he definitely had them [...] and so in a sense it would have required quite strong evidence the other way to be doubting the fact that he had this programme [...] The primary consideration for me was to send an absolutely powerful, clear and unremitting message that after September 11 if you were a regime engaged in WMD [weapons of mass destruction], you had to stop."

{{FA}}He also said that weapons of mass destruction and regime change were not separate issues, but "conjoined", since "brutal and oppressive" regimes with such weapons are a "bigger threat" than less hostile nations with the same weapons. He said that Hussein's regime was hiding important information from UN weapons inspectors, and had "no intention" of complying with them. He asserted that  he has "no regrets" about removing Hussein, "[a] monster and I believe he threatened not just the region but the world."

There were also questions about why the UN weapons inspectors were not given more time in Iraq in March 2003. Blair responded by saying that it would have made very little difference, as Iraq had the knowledge and "intent" to rebuild its weapons program from scratch if it were dismantled. He was also asked whether he still believed that the war was morally justified. He said that he did. He also said that the war was required because more diplomatic solutions had already failed, and the "containment" of Hussein's regime through diplomatic sanctions was "eroding" when the decision to invade was made.
{{QuoteLeft|I never regarded 11 September as an attack on America, I regarded it as an attack on us.|source=Tony Blair}}
He also said that attitudes towards Saddam Hussein and the threat he presented "changed dramatically" after the [[w:9/11|9/11]] attacks on the [[w:World Trade Centre|World Trade Centre]] in [[w:New York|New York]]. He said, "I never regarded 11 September as an attack on America, I regarded it as an attack on us." He said that he believed terrorists would use biological and chemical weaponry, and also said, "if those people inspired by this religious fanaticism could have killed 30,000 they would have. My view was you could not take risks with this issue at all."

He later said, "When I talked earlier about the calculus of risk changing after September 11 it's really important I think to understand in so far as to understanding the decision I took, and frankly would take again. If there was any possibility that he could develop weapons of mass destruction we should stop him. That was my view then. It's my view now."

=== Crawford commitment ===
He was also asked about his supposed commitment to [[George W. Bush]] that United Kingdom would join the [[United States]] in an Iraq war, which he is said to have made at Bush's Crawford ranch in 2002. Blair stubbornly denied that this took place, saying that what was said is that [[Saddam Hussein]] had to be "dealt with", and that "the method of doing that is open". Instead, he says, his reasons for the invasion were moral.
{{QuoteRight|The decision I had to take was ... could we take the risk of this man reconstituting his weapons programme?|source=Tony Blair}}
He also said, "This isn't about a lie or a conspiracy or a deceit or a deception. It's a decision. And the decision I had to take was, given Saddam's history, given his use of chemical weapons, given the over one million people whose deaths he had caused, given 10 years of breaking UN resolutions, could we take the risk of this man reconstituting his weapons programmes or is that a risk that it would be irresponsible to take?"

He said of Bush: "I think what he took from that [the meeting] was exactly what he should have taken, which was if it came to military action because there was no way of dealing with this diplomatically, we would be with him." He did admit, however, that—a year later, as the invasion approached—he had been offered a "way out" of the war, which he declined. He said of this, "I think President Bush at one point said, before the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[w:House of Commons|House of Commons]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> debate, 'Look if it's too difficult for Britain, we understand'. I took the view very strongly then—and do now—that it was right for us to be with America, since we believed in this too."

=== The 45-minute claim ===
Another line of questioning focused on his 45-minute claim, which was included in the September 2002 dossier but redacted after the war. It states that Hussein was able to deploy nuclear weapons within 45 minutes of giving the order. This dossier also contained the words, "the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons". However, the inquiry has revealed that there were certain caveats involved, so the claim was not—anti-war campaigners claim—"beyond doubt", especially since senior civil servants have told the inquiry that intelligence suggested that Hussein's weapons of mass destruction had been dismantled.

Blair said that it "would have been better if (newspaper) headlines about the '45-minute claim' had been corrected" to state—as he admits he should have made clear—that the claim referred to battlefield munitions, rather than to missiles. He says that, with the benefit of hindsight, he would have liked to have published the intelligence reports themselves, since they were "absolutely strong enough". He did insist, however, that the intelligence that was available at the time put it "beyond doubt" that Iraq was continuing to develop weaponry. He added that "things obviously look quite different" after the war, since weapons of mass destruction were not found.

=== Legality and planning ===
[[File:Ieagoldsmith.jpg|thumb|left|File photo of Lord Goldsmith, who told the inquiry earlier this week that he changed his mind about the legality of the war.{{image credit|[[w:User:Johnnyryan1|Johnnyryan1]]}}]]
One of the main topics was the legality of the war. Earlier this week, a senior Foreign Office legal advisor claimed that the war would be illegal without a further [[United Nations]] [[w:United Nations Security Council resolution|Security Council resolution]]—which was not obtained. The attorney general at the time, Lord [[w:Peter Goldsmith|Peter Goldsmith]], said that the cabinet refused to enter into a debate over the legality of the war, and that Blair had not received his advice that a further UN resolution would be needed warmly. He insists that he "desperately" tried to find a diplomatic solution to the problem until France and Russia "changed their position" and would not allow the passage of a further resolution.

Blair also said that he would not have invaded had Goldsmith said that it "could not be justified legally", and explained Goldsmith's change of mind by saying that the then attorney general "had to come to a conclusion", and his conclusion was that the war was legal. He did not know why Goldsmith made this conclusion, but said he believes that it may be due to the fact that weapons inspectors "indicated that Saddam Hussein had not taken a final opportunity to comply" with the UN.

Questions were also asked on the government's poor post-war planning, and claimed confusion about whether the US had a plan for Iraq after the war was over. Blair was drilled about the lack of priority that was given to the issue of post-war planning. He was also asked about the lack of equipment that British soldiers were given. This line of questioning was pursued in front of the families of some of the soldiers who died in Iraq—many of whom blame the poor equipment for the deaths of their relatives.

=== Response ===
{{HYS_question_right|Should Tony Blair be considered a war criminal?}}
The families of some of the 179 British soldiers killed in the Iraq war, along with around 200 anti-war protesters, held a demonstration calling for Blair to be declared a [[w:war crime|war criminal]] outside the centre in London's [[w:City of Westminster|City of Westminster]]. They chanted "Tony Blair, war criminal" as the former prime minister gave evidence inside. Blair was jeered by a member of the audience as he made his closing statement, and the families booed him, chanting "you are a liar" and "you are a murderer" as he left the centre.

In order to avoid the protesters, he arrived early and was escorted by security as he entered through the back door, with large numbers of police officers standing by. One of these protesters, Iraqi Saba Jaiwad, said, "The Iraqi people are having to live every day with aggression, division, and atrocities. Blair should not be here giving his excuses for the illegal war, he should be taken to [[w:The Hague|The Hague]] to face criminal charges because he has committed crimes against the Iraqi people."

Ahmed Rushdi, an Iraqi journalist, said that he was unsurprised by Blair's defence of the invasion, because, "A liar is still a liar". He also claimed that the war had done more harm than good, because, "Before 2003 there were problems with security, infrastructure and services, and people died because of the sanctions, but after 2003 there are major disasters. Major blasts have killed about 2,000 people up till now. After six years or seven years there is no success on the ground, in any aspect."

{{QuoteLeft|Why did we participate in an illegal invasion of another country?|source=Nick Clegg}}
Current prime minister [[Gordon Brown]], who set up the inquiry, said before Blair's appearance that it was not a cause for concern. Anthony Seldon, Blair's biographer, called the session "a pivotal day for him [Blair], for the British public and for Britain's moral authority in the world". [[w:Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] leader [[w:Nick Clegg|Nick Clegg]], who opposes the war, said in Friday's ''[[w:Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' that it was "a pivotal moment in answering a question millions of British people are still asking themselves: Why did we participate in an illegal invasion of another country?" He called the invasion "subservience-by-default to the White House", and questioned the "special relationship" between between the United Kingdom and the [[United States]].

Vincent Moss, the political editor of the ''[[w:Sunday Mirror|Sunday Mirror]]'' newspaper, criticised the inquiry for being too soft on Blair. He said, "A lot of ground wasn't covered, and in my mind it wasn't covered in enough detail, particularly the dodgy dossier in September 2002. There wasn't very much interrogation on that, they pretty much accepted what Tony Blair said about the intelligence. We could have had an awful lot stronger questioning on that".

It is feared by some senior [[w:Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politicians that today's events could ignite strong feelings about the issue in voters, and thereby damage the popularity of the party, which is already trailing behind the [[w:Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] with a general election required in the first half of the year.

Gaddafi loses African Union chair
{{date|January 31, 2010}}
[[File:Muammar al-Gaddafi, 12th AU Summit, 090202-N-0506A-324.jpg|thumb|left|Gaddafi at last year's African Union summit, where he became president.]]
[[File:Bingu Wa Mutharika - World Economic Forum on Africa 2008.jpg|thumb|right|File photo of Mutharika, who is taking the presidency.]]
[[Muammar Gaddafi]], leader of [[Libya]], has not been able to win his bid to stay as chairman of the [[African Union]], losing out to [[Malawi]]an president {{w|Bingu wa Mutharika}}, who was backed by several eastern and southern states.

Gaddafi used his final speech to highlight the need for political unity between African states. Libya has been chairing the African Union for the last year, and the job of chair was due to go to a southern African representative. However, Gaddafi wished to retain the presidency, which was backed by [[Tunisia]], and had allegedly won over other countries by paying their membership fees.

The African Union summit, held in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], involved a speech to the African leaders by [[UN]] Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]], who called for the countries to strive for national union in [[Sudan]], where the southern part of the country may secede from the north. <!-- Mike Godwin can be presumed to support this --> In addition, the Secretary General highlighted the various achievements of the African Union. He said that they had "seen a sharp decrease in [[malaria]] and measles deaths across the continent, virtual gains in primary school enrolment [and] marked improvement in child health", stating that "we must build on these successes and help spread them around the world".

The three-day summit involves topics such as the state of affairs in [[Somalia]], and a [[Senegal]]ese proposal to resettle [[Haiti]] earthquake victims.

Ban Ki-Moon says Cyprus solution "possible"
{{date|February 1, 2010}}
[[File:Ban Ki-moon 1-2.jpg|thumb|File photo of Ban Ki-Moon. {{image credit|World Economic Forum}}]][[File:GreenLine_BufferZone_Large.JPG|thumb|left|A UN buffer zone separates the two sections. {{image credit|Jpatokal}}]]
A new set of talks are scheduled to attempt to reunite [[Cyprus]], prompting [[UN]] Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] to say that a solution is "possible and within reach" when he arrived in the country yesterday for talks between [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Turkey|Turkish]]-Cypriot leaders that will take place later today.

Progress have been slow for the peace talks, which started in September 2008,  but the UN chief said that a deal would require "courage, flexibility and vision as well as a spirit of compromise". "I am under no illusion that the Cyprus problem is easy to solve", he told reporters after he arrived in [[w:Larnaca|Larnaca]] yesterday in preparation for the talks with Greek Cypriot leader [[w:Demetris Christofias|Demetris Christofias]] and Turkish Cypriot [[w:Mehmet Ali Talat|Mehmet Ali Talat]] today.

Ban said that "solving the Cyprus problem will give inspiration to all those around the world trying to solve other seemingly intractable problems and I'm looking forward to having good meetings with the leaders", with the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders saying that they are committed to finding a solution. Monday's talks will involve Ban holding talks with the two leaders individually, before chairing a meeting between the pair. Any deal that emerges will be a subject of two simultaneous referendums, one for each side of the border. Both sides agree that "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed".

Jonny Dymond, the BBC Europe correspondent, has expressed fears that time is running out on a solution. There are also worries that the fast approaching northern Cyprus leadership elections will mean that Talat is replaced by nationalist [[w:Dervis Eroglu|Dervis Eroglu]], who is leading in opinion polls. If this were to happen, talks might be shelved.

Cyprus has been divided since 1974, after Turkish forces invaded after a coup led by Greece allegedly aimed to absorb it. Northern Cyprus is only recognised as a state by Turkey.

African Union considers proposal to resettle Haitians
{{date|February 2, 2010}}
{{2010 Haiti earthquake}}
The [[African Union]] (AU) has agreed to consider a proposal to resettle [[Haiti]]ans affected by the recent magnitude 7.0 [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake]] to [[Africa]], and perhaps create a separate state for them on the continent.
[[Image:Abdoulaye Wade - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting New York 2002.jpg|thumb|left|190px|File photo of Aboulaye Wade, who initially came up with the idea to resettle Haitian earthquake victims {{image credit|World Economic Forum}}]]{{w|Abdoulaye Wade}}, the president of [[Senegal]], first proposed the plan on January 17, saying that Haitians were descendants of {{w|Atlantic slave trade|slaves initially from Africa}}, and that gives them a right to return to the continent. Wade commented that African countries should naturalise Haitians wanting a new nationality, and called for a mass adoption programme.

"It is out of a sense of duty and memory and solidarity that we can further the proposal to create in Africa the conditions for the return of Haitians who wish to return after the effect of the disaster that ravaged Haiti," commented AU chairman Jean Ping at the AU's annual summit, held in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]]. "What happened to Haiti is a tragedy that transcends borders. We have attachment and links to that country. The first black republic in 1804, that carried high the flame of liberation and freedom for the black people and has paid a heavy price for so doing."

The [[United Nations]] general-secretary, [[Ban Ki-moon]], thanked the AU "for reaching out to Haiti in this time of need", remarking that "the nation of Haiti is an ocean away, yet I know it is close to every African heart. Today the Haitian people are enduring one of the greatest humanitarian challenges in recent years and loss of life on an
unimaginable scale."

The Haiti earthquake, which struck on January 12, is estimated to have killed approximately 170,000 people, and left over a million without homes.

Ex-minister says UK Cabinet was "misled" about legality of Iraq war
{{date|February 3, 2010}}
__NOTOC__
{{Iraq}}[[File:Clare Short, Birmingham for Gaza, January 2009 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|In this 2009 file photo, Clare Short is speaking at a rally in Birmingham. {{image credit|[http://www.flickr.com/people/delicacy/ Faizan Bhat]}}]]
[[w:Clare Short|Clare Short]], the [[United Kingdom]]'s then-[[w:Secretary of State for International Development|Secretary of State for International Development]], appeared before [[w:the Iraq Inquiry|the Iraq Inquiry]] yesterday, and told the panel that the Cabinet was "misled" about the [[Iraq War]]'s legality prior to the 2003 [[w:2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]]. The three-hour session was held in the [[w:Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre|Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre]] in [[w:London|London]]'s [[w:City of Westminster|City of Westminster]].

Short, an outspoken critic of the war, retired from the cabinet to become an independent MP two months before the invasion. She claimed to have been "conned" into staying on despite her doubts about the war and told the inquiry that the Cabinet, of which she was a part, was not a "decision-making body", and that Parliament was simply a "rubber stamp".

=== Lord Goldsmith's decision ===

She also claimed that [[Tony Blair]] "and his mates" had acted "on a wing and a prayer", having "leaned on" then-[[w:Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General for England and Wales]] Lord [[w:Peter Goldsmith|Peter Goldsmith]], pressurising him to change his mind about the invasion. She did, however, admit that she had no evidence to support these claims. Goldsmith gave a verdict that the war would be legal only shortly before the invasion, having firmly held the belief that it would not be without a further [[United Nations]] [[w:United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] resolution.

Short was applauded as she concluded her testimony, in which she said that she was "shocked" at how a definitive statement about the legality of the war circulated only as late as March 17, 2003 — just three days before the invasion began — that this state of shock led her to be "jeered at" by other ministers. Said statement, according to Short, contained no hint that Goldsmith had previously had any doubts whatsoever.

She said any discussion of legality was stopped at the same pre-war cabinet meeting. She accused Blair of standing in the way of such discussion, and said, "Everything that's happened since makes me know that there was deliberate blockage and there were also all sorts of secret, private meetings", and that normal cabinet communications were "closed down" as the invasion approached. "There was never a meeting that said 'what's the problem, what are we trying to achieve, what are our military, diplomatic options?' We never had that coherent discussion ... never."
{{QuoteRight|I think [Goldsmith] misled the cabinet. He certainly misled me, but people let it through|source=Clare Short}}
Goldsmith responded to her inquiries about the lateness of this statement by saying "it takes me a long time to make my mind up", and that he had made his decision after consulting foreign legal professionals. She said that Goldsmith's "doubts and his changes of opinion" made her "think for the attorney general to come and say there's unequivocal legal authority to go war was misleading." She said that "I think he misled the cabinet. He certainly misled me, but people let it through". 
{{QuoteLeft|[I]f we got a Palestinian state and a UN lead on reconstruction, that will be much better|source=Clare Short}}
She claimed that the government, having failed to secure a required UN resolution, started the "untrue" rumour that [[France]] had vetoed it. She said that she "believed them at the time. You don't want to disbelieve your Prime Minister in the run-up to war and you want to believe the leader of your party. You want to be loyal".

=== UN involvement ===
When asked why she had not resigned earlier than she did, she said that she "was conned" by Blair's promises of a strong role for the UN in the reconstruction of Iraq, as well as more attempts to resolve the conflict about [[Israel]]. She said that she "thought that if we got a Palestinian state and a UN lead on reconstruction, that will be much better ... I took a lot of flak for it. I still think, if we had done those things, it would have been a heck of a lot better." She says that this lack of UN involvement in the post-invasion reconstruction effort was her main reason for retiring from the government.

Short said that she "was seeing the intelligence" about Iraq at the earlier stages of preparation for an invasion, but that in late 2002 "asked for a briefing... This just didn't come and didn't come... it became clear there was some sort of block on communications." Apparently, the intelligence reports she say said that "Saddam Hussein didn't have nuclear [weapons] ... [he] would if he could but he was nowhere near it. It wasn't saying there was some new imminent threat".

=== Tony Blair, 9/11, and post-war planning ===
Short asserted Blair's evidence, given to the inquiry on Friday, was "historically inaccurate", since "[t]here was no evidence of any kind of an escalation of threats" after the [[w:September 11, 2001|September 11]] terrorist attacks on the [[w:World Trade Centre|World Trade Centre]]. This is contrary to Blair's claims that attitudes towards the threat Iraq posed "changed dramatically" after the attacks, and that [[Saddam Hussein]] "threatened not just the region but the world".
{{QuoteRight|We could have gone more slowly and carefully and not have had a totally destabilised and angry Iraq|source=Clare Short}}
She said, "We could have gone more slowly and carefully and not have had a totally destabilised and angry Iraq. The American people were misled to suggest that al-Qaeda had links to Saddam Hussein. Everybody knows that is untrue - that he had absolutely no links, no sympathy, al-Qaeda were nowhere near Iraq until after the invasion and the disorder that came from that." Short criticised the military for not meeting the obligations laid out for them, as an occupying force, by the [[w:Geneva Convention|Geneva Convention]].

=== Background and response ===
[[w:Lord Boyce|Lord Boyce]], the former head of the British armed forces, said in an earlier hearing that officials from the [[w:Department for International Development|Department for International Development]] — Short's department — let their opposition to the war prevent them from cooperating fully with the rest of the government immediately after the invasion. [[w:Alistair Campbell|Alistair Campbell]], Blair's former spokesman, said that Short had been "difficult to handle" in the run-up to the invasion, and that there was fear that she may leak pieces of information that she did not agree with. Lord [[w:Andrew Turnbull, Baron Turnbull|Andrew Turnbull]], former [[w:Secretary of the Cabinet|Secretary of the Cabinet]], however, said that these concerns were unfair, and that minority voices had been unfairly pushed to the sidelines.

[[w:Hilary Benn|Hilary Benn]], who took over Short's post after her resignation, is scheduled to give evidence before the inquiry today.

UNHCR: Somalia violence killed 258 civilians last month; tens of thousands displaced
{{date|February 3, 2010}}
{{Somalia}}The [[w:United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) has said that, in the last month, 258 civilians were killed and a further 80,000 displaced by the ongoing violence in [[Somalia]], between the government and rebel groups.

"According to local sources, intense clashes between government forces and militia groups fighting for control of the conflict- torn central regions have left at least 258 civilians dead and another 253 wounded, which makes January the deadliest month since last August," the [[UN]] agency said in a statement. "We estimate that more than 80,000 Somalis have been displaced since the beginning of the year. Thousands were also forced to leave their homes in other parts of Somalia."

The violence has made it difficult for humanitarian aid workers to access the population effectively. Andrej Mahecic, the spokesman of the UN refugees agency, noted: "So far, the deteriorating security conditions have made it hard, if not impossible, for humanitarian workers to access the needy population."

The [[w:Xinhua|Xinhua]] news agency reports that UNHCR intends to send relief and shelter supplies to upwards of 18,000 people in 27 locations, where displaced residents are living temporarily, when it is considered safe to do so.

Among those displaced were 18,000 people who fled their homes in the capital, [[w:Mogadishu|Mogadishu]]; meanwhile, 29,000 were displaced in [[w:Dhusamareebb|Dhusamareebb]], in the Galgaduud region, and 25,000 in [[w:Beledweyne|Beledweyne]] in the Hiraan region.

A total of 1.4 million Somalis are currently internally displaced, 560,000 more are refugees in adjacent countries; last year, 120,000 residents sought refuge, primarily in [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], and [[Yemen]].

The UN says Somalia is in its worst humanitarian crisis for eighteen years.

IPCC chief refuses to apologize for glacier error
{{date|February 3, 2010}}{{Climate change}}
[[image:Ragendra Pachauri.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Rajendra K. Pachauri, the chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) at a conference in Vienna, 22 June 2009.{{image credit|Evstafiev}} ]]

The chief of the [[w:UN climate change panel|UN climate change panel]], Dr. [[w:Rajendra Pachauri|Rajendra Pachauri]], admitted on Wednesday that a mistake in a 2007 report had raised questions about the body's credibility, in an interview with [[w:The Guardian|''The Guardian'']].

The [[w:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s (IPCC)  landmark [[w:IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]] in 2007 said the probability of glaciers in the [[w:Himalayas|Himalayas]] "disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high."

There is no evidence the claim was published in a [[w:peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal, thus calling into question its credibility.
{{QuoteLeft|"I think this (glacier) mistake has certainly cost us dear, there's no question about it,"|source=Rajendra Pachauri}}
He refused to apologize in the interview with ''The Guardian'' for the unverified claim. "I think this (glacier) mistake has certainly cost us dear, there's no question about it," Pachauri told the newspaper. "Everybody thought that what the IPCC brought out was the gold standard and nothing could go wrong."You can't expect me to be personally responsible for every word in a 3,000 page report," he said.


The IPCC issued a statement expressing regret for the mistake, but Pachauri said, "I don't do too many populist things, that's why I'm so unpopular with a certain section of society," defending his refusal for an apology.

Somali opposition group al-Shabaab to block WFP food aid
{{date|February 28, 2010}}

{{Somalia}}[[Al-Shabaab]], the [[Somalia|Somali]] opposition group, has said it will stop food operations by the [[United Nations]]' {{w|World Food Programme}} (WFP) in the country, accusing the agency of being politically motivated and disadvantaging local farmers.

{{missing image|Image:WFPlogo130.svg|thumb|left|[[w:World Food Programme|World Food Programme]] logo {{Image source|[[United Nations]]}}}}
Al-Shabaab said that the agency was ruining local farming, as the quantity of the food aid didn't allow farmers to sell their goods at reasonable prices.

A statement from the group read that "[g]iven the problems caused by the food WFP distributed, the movement of Shabab Al-Mujahideen banned the operations of the agency in Somalia generally starting from today. The contractors working with WFP must avoid collaborating [...] anyone working with the agency will be seen serving the interest of WFP."

The WFP, meanwhile, says that armed members of al-Shabaab have blocked off food aid to refugee camps in the city of {{w|Afgoye}}.

Peter Smerdon commented on the move to the [[BBC]], saying: "The WFP is extremely concerned about the health of the displaced families who rely on humanitarian assistance reaching them. The people in Afgoye last received a general food distribution from WFP in November 2009, so we fear that they are going very hungry."

"We fear they are suffering even more because food assistance cannot reach them, and some of them may be forced to leave Afgoye as conditions in the camp deteriorate," he added. A statement released by the WFP claims that its motivations in Somalia were "impartial and non political". On the agency's official website, the WFP describes Somalia as being "one of the most dangerous places in the world", and having "the highest humanitarian need for the size of its population".

The official Somali government does not control much of the country outside of the capital [[w:Mogadishu|Mogadishu]]; many areas in southern Somalia are controlled by al-Shabaab.

Polio vaccination campaign targets 85 million African children
{{date|March 7, 2010}}
{{Health}}
[[File:Polio EM PHIL 1875 lores.PNG|thumb|left|120px|An electron micrograph of the poliovirus {{Image credit|CDC/ Dr. Fred Murphy, Sylvia Whitfield}}]]
An extensive vaccination campaign across 19 [[w:West Africa|West]] and [[w:Central Africa|Central African]] countries is to begin today in an attempt to stem a year-long [[w:polio|polio]] epidemic in the region. The [[United Nations]] and international aid agencies plan to immunize 85 million children under five. More than 400, 000 volunteers and health workers will take part in the campaign, visiting children in their homes.

The current polio epidemic has been going on for a year and there have been outbreaks in the last six months in [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Guinea]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. These countries will be the focus of the campaign, along with [[Benin]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Togo]].

Efforts last year failed to halt the disease because not enough children were vaccinated. The program failed in part because local religious leaders told parents that the vaccines would sterilize their children, or cause [[w:AIDS|AIDS]]. As well as targeting more children, today's campaign features better training for volunteers. Vaccinations will be repeated on 26 March in the six key countries, and again on 24 April for all 19 countries involved. The campaign is funded by [[w:Rotary International|Rotary International]] who have provided $30 million.

In 2009 the [[World Health Organization]] reported that approximately 1,600 children were paralysed by the virus worldwide.

Up to one-half of Somali food aid diverted from needy
{{date|March 12, 2010}}
{{Somalia}}
{{missing image|File:WFPlogo130.svg|120px|left|thumb|Logo of the World Food Programme}}
According to a leaked [[United Nations]] report, up to one-half of all food aid to [[Somalia]] from the {{w|World Food Programme}} (WFP) is diverted to local contractors and militants.

The United Nations monitoring group in Somalia authored the report, which has not yet been publicly introduced, but was shown by diplomats to the ''{{w|The New York Times}}'', and is to be formally presented on March 16.  According to the document, food aid to Somalia is regularly diverted to a complex network of contractors for the United Nations within the country, who in turn have moved either the aid itself or monetary profits from the transportation of it to armed militant groups within Somalia.

A part of the report said that "A handful of Somali contractors for aid agencies have formed a cartel and become important power brokers—some of whom channel their profits, or the aid itself, directly to armed opposition groups."

The WFP, which is in charge of the aid, was heavily criticized for its actions regarding to Somalian aid, particularly the contracts for the movement of the aid, which the report claims are largely awarded to three Somali businessman who are alleged to have connections to militant groups.  The report also blames problems with the general distribution of aid in the country, where the lack of a functioning government has led to "ineffective, disorganized and corrupt" security forces.  It suggests that the only way to resolve these problems is to completely overhaul the aid system to break the control of aid by local forces.
{{QuoteLeft|The integrity of our organisation is paramount and we will be reviewing and investigating each and every issue raised by this report|4=Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Program}}

The WFP has denied previous allegations of corruption and abuse in Somalia, but it said that it would investigate the findings of the new report. The programs' executive director also released a statement saying, "The integrity of our organisation is paramount and we will be reviewing and investigating each and every issue raised by this report."

Allegations that food aid was being diverted also arose last year, which led the [[United States]] to reduce funding to Somalia, for fears that aid was ending up with the Islamic group {{w|al-Shabaab}}.  Since then, the WFP has been banned by al-Shabaab from operating in Somalia, a move that followed the WFP's suspension of operations in southern Somalia amid attacks from militants.

UN official: 90 Rwandan rebels killed in DRC by army troops
{{date|March 11, 2010}}
{{Rwanda}}
Madnodje Mounouba, a spokesman for the [[United Nations]]' mission in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC), said yesterday that DRC army troops killed 90 [[Rwanda]]n Hutu rebels in the eastern part of Congo.

He said that the deaths occurred during a two-week army operation by the DRC army targeting the {{w|Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda}} (FLDR) group, which was conducted with assistance from UN peacekeepers. The spokesman added that 68 rebels also surrendered, and two rebel bases were destroyed.

"In Nord-Kivu, two operations have been completed [at] Kashebere and Mayengara, with the following results: on the FDLR side, 23 killed, 40 surrendered and two bases destroyed," the spokesman said.

The Hutus have been accused of killing hundreds of DRC villagers in the eastern part of the country; last year, DRC and Rwandan troops conducted a short offensive against them. 

Eastern DRC has frequently seen violence since the {{w|Rwandan Genocide|1994 Rwandan genocide}}, as the militias believed to have played a part in them moved across the border.

[[File:EscombrosBelAir12.jpg|thumb|left|Two women walk by the body of a dead man, in the streets of the Port-au-Prince neighborhood of Bel-Air. {{image source|[[w:Agencia Brasil|Agencia Brasil]]}}]]
As reported the [[United Nations]], [[w:2010 Haiti earthquake|January 12 Haiti earthquake]] left exactly 222,570 deaths, 1,300,000 refugees in harbours, 766,000 displaced people, 310,000 injured and 869 disappeared. The report also mentioned economic loss suffered by the country, that reached 7.754 billion dollars, leaving 71 percent of the Haitians in extreme poverty.

The document was diffused in [[w:Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo de Guzmán]], between the preparatives of a conference about the reconstruction of [[Haiti]], that will take place next March 11 in [[w:New York|New York]].

Haitian Government representatives have asked to donors an additional help of 350 million dollars for the Haiti reconstruction, the most poor country in the Americas.

Ex-UN official says Pakistan disrupted talks with Taliban
{{date|March 21, 2010}}
{{Afghanistan}}The [[United Nations]]' former top official in [[Afghanistan]] has accused [[Pakistan]] of impeding negotiations between the [[Afghan Taliban|Taliban]] and Western nations.

The official, [[w:Kai Eide|Kai Eide]], said that the arrests of high-ranking Taliban officials by [[w:Pakistan|Pakistan]] had led to the disruption of talks between the Taliban and the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]] in Dubai.  According to Eide, the two parties had conducted “talks about talks,” but they had broken down completely after Pakistan's arrests.  In an interview with the BBC, he said that "the Pakistanis did not play the role that they should have played."  Pakistan's actions have prompted some speculation that the country was opposed to a peace deal between Western nations and the Taliban, or wanted to take a greater part in the talks.  Pakistan, however, has denied the arrests were intended to disrupt talks between the UN and the Taliban.

Eide said that the talks between both sides had begun around a year ago, and had continued until several weeks ago, with a pause for the [[w:Afghan presidential election, 2009|Afghan elections]]. While other avenues for communication exist, including via the Afghan government, Eide said that it would take at least several weeks for such talks to resume after the disruption.

Peace talks between the two sides are widely seen as necessary to gain peace with the Taliban, although the approaches taken by European countries and the [[United States]] are almost opposite.  The US announced a significant military buildup in Afghanistan last fall, and is trying to weaken the Taliban military before engaging in talks.  Western European countries are pushing for more immediate negotiations, and officials such as David Miliband, British foreign secretary, are focusing on engaging all but the most militant members of the Taliban.

United Nations: More people with access to cell phones than toilets in India
{{date|April 16, 2010}}
{{India}}
[[File:Clean toilet water rafting.jpg|thumb|left|Public toilet in India.{{image credit|John Hill}}]]
According to a [[United Nations]] survey, more people in [[India]], the second most populous country in the world, have access to mobile phones than to a proper toilet. Over half a billion cell phones are active in India, but only 366 million people there have access to a toilet.

"It is a tragic irony to think that in India, a country now wealthy enough that roughly half of the people own phones, about half cannot afford the basic necessity and dignity of a toilet," commented Zafar Adeel, Director of United Nations University's Institute for Water, Environment and Health (IWEH).

India's 545 million cell phones serve about 45 per cent of the population of more than one billion. Only 31 per cent (366 million) have access to modern hygienic amenities as of 2008. The United Nations University (UNU) recommends achieving the [[w:Millennium Development Goal|Millennium Development Goal]] (MDG) which aims to cut in half the number of people lacking safe water and proper sanitary arrangements. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), there would be a deficit of one billion people from that target aimed for 2015. 

"Anyone who shirks the topic as repugnant, minimises it as undignified, or considers unworthy those in need should let others take over for the sake of 1.5 million children and countless others killed each year by contaminated water and unhealthy sanitation," Adeel added. 

"Popular education about the health dangers of poor sanitation is also needed. But this simple measure could do more to save lives, especially those of young people, improve health and help pull India and other countries in similar circumstances out of poverty than any alternative investment. It can also serve as a very significant boost to the local economy," he said. "The world can expect, however, a return of between $3 and $34 for every dollar spent on sanitation, realized through reduced poverty and health costs and higher productivity — an economic and humanitarian opportunity of historic proportions."

The nine recommendations made by the UNU include changing the MDG target from 50 per cent by 2015 to 100 per cent coverage by 2025. Another suggested reform was to assign 0.002 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) to improving sanitation. Approximately 358 billion dollars would be required to achieve that MDG target, considering that a toilet costs 300 dollars.

UN report says death of Benazir Bhutto preventable; fault of government
{{date|April 17, 2010}}{{Pakistan}}A [[United Nations]] report released Thursday says that the death of [[w:Benazir Bhutto|Benazir Bhutto]] after a suicide bomber attacked her motorcade in 2007 was preventable and was caused by the failure of the government to live up to its obligations to protect her.
{{QuoteLeft|None of these entities [government agencies] took the necessary measures to respond to the extraordinary, fresh and urgent security risks that they knew she faced|4=A UN report on the assassination of Benizar Bhutto}}

The report, released by a three-person UN commission, accused the [[Pakistan]]i government of failing to take "the necessary measures to respond to the extraordinary, fresh and urgent security risks that they knew she faced."  Additionally, Pakistani investigators were said to have deliberately avoided solving the case, as they were afraid that the evidence would indict the government. 

According to the commission, "irreparable damage to the investigation" was caused by the actions taken directly after the assassination, including cleaning the area in which Bhutto was killed and failing to collect evidence pertaining to the crime. In an area that should have yielded thousands of pieces of evidence, UN investigators recovered only 23.

Supporters of Bhutto were also criticized; the report said that backup security for Bhutto was insufficient.  Such security was the responsibility of Bhutto's husband, [[w:Asif Ali Zardari|Asif Ali Zardari]], president of Pakistan.  Pakistani Interior Minister [[w:Rehman Malik|Rehman Malik]] was also singled out; he was accused of a "serious security lapse" in leaving the scene of the explosion that killed Bhutto.
{{QuoteRight|The commission believes that the failure of the police to investigate effectively Ms Bhutto's assassination was deliberate|4=A UN report on the assassination of Benizar Bhutto}}

The report was unexpectedly harsh, and provided damning accounts of specific security failures around the assassination. It said that "None of these entities [government agencies] took the necessary measures to respond to the extraordinary, fresh and urgent security risks that they knew she faced," and that "The commission believes that the failure of the police to investigate effectively Ms Bhutto's assassination was deliberate."

UN official: DR Congo is ‘rape capital of the world’
{{date|April 30, 2010}}
{{Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[File:Margot Wallström.jpg|left|thumb|Wallstrom is the current envoy on sexual violence in conflict]]
A top [[United Nations]] official has called the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] the "[[rape]] capital of the world". The UN's special representative on sexual violence in conflict, {{w|Margot Wallstrom}}, said that the [[UN Security Council]] needs to "punish the perpetrators in DR Congo".

Data collected by the UN shows that 200,000 cases of sexual assault have been reported in the last 14 years, 8,000 of which occurred last year and 1,244 of which occurred in the first three months of 2010. The UN's mission has been trying to combat the problem by escorting women when they go to market and working closely with the local officials. 

Wallstrom released a statement after returning from a visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She said: "Women have no [[women's rights|rights]], if those who violate their rights go unpunished. If women continue to suffer sexual violence, it is not because the law is inadequate to protect them, but because it is inadequately enforced.

The {{w|Harvard Humanitarian Society}} issued a report in April showing that in {{w|South Kivu}}, an eastern province in DR Congo, 60% of the women raped were raped by armed men. More than half were raped in their own home, and more civilians are committing the attacks than ever before. 

Despite the country's war ending in 2003, DR Congo is still plagued with militia violence.

Nineteen activists killed by Israeli commandos aboard aid convoy bound for Gaza
{{date|May 31, 2010}}
{{correction|label=Notice|date=August 24, 2015|explanation=The title of this article states nineteen were killed, whereas the body more accurately reflects the facts of the time by recording between nine and nineteen deaths. The correct figure at the time was in fact nine deaths.}}

[[File:Freedom Flotilla banner for press.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Freedom Flotilla banner. {{image credit|[http://www.flickr.com/photos/freegaza/4599521000/ Freegazaorg - Flickr]}}]]

Between nine and nineteen {{w|Free Gaza Movement}} activists died today in international waters when [[Israeli Defense Forces|Israeli Defense Force]] commandos {{w|Gaza flotilla clash|boarded vessels}} attempting to break the Israeli {{w|2007–2010 blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade of Gaza}}. 

[[Benjamin Netanyahu]] gave the death toll to be at least 10. Israeli television says that 19 people were killed and 36 were wounded in the confrontation. 

The six vessels, called the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, were carrying 10,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid destined for the [[Gaza Strip]], including water purifiers, prefabricated homes and medical equipment. Passengers include several {{w|European member of parliament|European members of parliament}} and MPs from [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[Algeria]] and [[Israel]]. 

Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister {{w|Danny Ayalon}} said that  "the organizers are well-known for their ties with global jihad, al-Qaida and Hamas. They have a history of arms smuggling and deadly terror." The Israeli military had declared it would not allow the ships to reach Gaza and said the activists were a "provocation intended to delegitimise Israel". The Israeli Navy had been transmitting messages throughout the night ordering them to turn back, stating: "If you ignore this order and enter the blockaded area, the Israeli navy will be forced to take all the necessary measures in order to enforce this blockade," and that the Gaza region was a protected military zone. 

{{w|Huwaida Arraf}}, one of the organizers, had said that the flotilla was "fully prepared for the different scenarios" that might arise, and organizers were hopeful that Israeli authorities would "do what's right" and not stop the convoy. She said, "we fully intend to go to Gaza regardless of any intimidation of threats of violence against us," and that "they are going to have to forcefully stop us." 

The pre-dawn boarding took place in international waters around 150 kilometres (90 miles) off the coast of Gaza. Footage from on the flotilla's lead vessel, the {{w|MV Mavi Marmara|MV ''Mavi Marmara''}}, and video released by the IDF, showed armed Israeli commandos boarding the ship from helicopters and fighting with activists. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the activists attacked the commandos with batons, knives and axes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said;
{{cquote|They were mobbed. They were clubbed, they were beaten, stabbed. There was even a report of gunfire and our soldiers had to defend themselves, defend their lives or they would have been killed.}}

A spokesman for the flotilla, Greta Berlin accused Israeli troops of indiscriminately shooting at "unarmed civilians". Israel said troops found weapons aboard the Gaza flotilla which were used against the IDF. The allegations were rejected by both the Free Gaza Movement, IHH and Egypt's foreign minister, who said the boats had been searched before they left port. 

{{QuoteLeft|The images are certainly not pleasant. I can only voice regret at all the fatalities|40px|40px|{{w|Binyamin Ben-Eliezer}} Israeli trade and industry minister.}}

{{w|Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General}}  of the United Nations [[Ban Ki-Moon]] said he was "shocked by reports of killings and injuries of people on boats carrying supplies for Gaza" and called for "a full investigation to determine exactly how this bloodshed took place" and urged Israel to "urgently provide a full explanation". Palestinian Authority President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] called for three days of mourning to commemorate what he called the "massacre" of protesters. {{w|Ismail Haniya}}, the Hamas leader in Gaza, has dubbed the Israeli action as "a crime". 

[[Turkey]]'s prime minister describes Israeli raid as '{{w|state terrorism}}' and said Israel violated international laws. Some of the ships were sailing under Turkish flags and media reports indicate that Turkish nationals are among the dead. Turkey demanded an "urgent explanation" from Israel and  warned of "irreparable consequences" after the incident. Netanyahu said the raid was self defense. Turkey is withdrawing its ambassador to Israel and is calling on the U.N. Security Council to convene in an emergency session about Israel.

The [[European Union]]'s foreign policy chief, {{w|Catherine Ashton}}, has called on Israeli authorities to launch a "full inquiry" into the killing. She "reiterates the European Union's position regarding Gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive." [[Germany]]'s Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said he was "deeply concerned" and [[France]] said "nothing can justify" the incident. [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], [[Greece]] and [[Spain]] have said it was important to "quickly establish" what happened, and have summoned the Israeli ambassadors.

[[File:Gaza flotilla clash demonstration in Belfast 3.jpg|thumb|right|Gaza flotilla clash demonstration in Belfast. ]]
The [[United Kingdom|British]] Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] has called on the Government of Israel to open all crossings for aid to enter Gaza and said Israel should "address the serious concerns about the deterioration in the humanitarian and economic situation and about the effect on a generation of young Palestinians‪." Russia calls attention to the fact that the Israeli interception of a Gaza-bound international aid flotilla took place in international waters, which it said represents a gross violation of international law.

[[European Parliament]] President {{w|Jerzy Buzek}} has urged the international Middle East mediators [[Russia]], the [[United States]], the [[United Nations]] and the European Union to persuade Israel to end its blockade of Gaza. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Europe. In [[Greece]] and [[France]] there was clashes with police. There were protests in cities around the [[Ireland]], [[UK]] and [[Italy]]. In the Middle East there were protests in [[Turkey]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Iran]].

The White House said that the [[United States]] "deeply regrets" the loss of life and injuries and was working to understand the circumstances surrounding this "tragedy". The {{w|Organization of the Islamic Conference}}, comprising of 57 countries, described the flotilla incident as "a serious escalation and a flagrant violation of the international law and human values." 

The media has not been given access to the politicians, activists and journalists who were in the convoy or information about deaths and injuries. Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld police say it will deport the roughly 50 of the 671 activists in the flotilla except those who refuse to cooperate. The other activists have been sent to jail in the southern desert town of Beersheba after refusing to identify themselves and will remain in detention. 

Irishman {{w|Dennis Halliday}}, a former assistant secretary general of the United Nations and the [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, {{w|Mairead Corrigan Maguire}}, are aboard the only boat left in the convoy, the Irish {{w|MV Rachel Corrie|MV ''Rachel Corrie''}} vessel, named after {{w|Rachel Corrie}}. The vessel is now on the way to the Gaza Strip. The Irish Prime Minister Mr Cowen said he believed Israel’s blockade of humanitarian assistance to Gaza was illegal under international law.

Second round of Bonn UN Climate Change negotiations continue
{{date|June 3, 2010}}
{{United Nations}}
The {{w|2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference}} {{nowrap|(COP 16)}} negotiations continued this week in {{w|Bonn, Germany|Bonn}}, {{w|Germany}}.  The 4,500 attendees include government delegates from 182 governments, representatives from business and industry, environmental organizations and research institutions.  COP 16 is scheduled to take place November 29 &ndash; December 10, 2010 in {{w|Cancún}}, {{w|Mexico}}.

{{w|Luis Alfonso de Alba}}, [[Mexico]]'s special representative for climate change, told Reuters, "Mexico does not want to raise false expectations but we certainly are ambitious". He criticised the outgoing head of the U.N.'s climate secretariat, {{w|Yvo de Boer}}, and the European Union's climate commissioner {{w|Connie Hedegaard}} for their scepticism.

Negotiating under the  {{w|United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change}} {{nowrap|(UNFCCC)}}, the next negotiating session is scheduled to take place in August, followed by another, final one-week intersessional meeting, before Cancún.  The talks were designed to discuss issues that were not resolved at the {{w|United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference}} {{nowrap|(COP 15)}} in {{w|Copenhagen}}.

The two working groups are the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action {{nowrap|(AWG-LCA)}} and the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex {{nowrap|(AWG-KP)}}. These groups were specifically designed to negotiate a long-term response to climate change. 

The AWG-LCA is the negotiating group tasked to deliver a new "COP16 negotiative text" ahead of the June negotiating session.  The AWG-KP is to focus on emissions reduction commitments for the 37 industrialised countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol for the period beyond 2012.

There are also two UNFCCC standing committees meetings, the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice {{nowrap|(SBSTA)}} and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation {{nowrap|(SBI)}}.

The conference is officially referred to as the 16th session of the Conference of the Parties {{nowrap|(COP 16)}} to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 6th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties {{nowrap|(CMP 6)}} to the {{w|Kyoto Protocol}}.

UN Security Council imposes more sanctions against Iran
{{date|June 11, 2010}}
{{United Nations}}
[[File:United Nations Security Council.jpg|thumb|left|UN Security Council Chamber in [[New York City|New York]]]]
The [[United Nations Security Council]] has passed {{w|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929|Resolution 1929}} imposing a fourth round of sanctions against [[Iran]] over its alleged {{w|Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program}}.

The Security Council voted 13 to 2 to impose new sanctions on Iran unless it reveals more details of its nuclear programme. [[Brazil]] and [[Turkey]] voted against the resolution, while [[Lebanon]] abstained. 

The sanctions do not include major blockades, but do include measures against Iranian banks abroad, a cargo inspection regime, and provisions that all countries shall prevent the supply, sale or transfer to Iran of battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, large calibre artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, missiles, or missile systems.

President [[Obama]]  praised the Security Council vote and said, "This resolution will put in place the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government, and it sends an unmistakable message about the international community’s commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons".

Brazil and Turkey criticised the sanctions, saying they could undermine further diplomatic efforts. They had previously offered to mediate the dispute, an offer which was accepted by Iran. Iran recently reached a deal with them to ship most of its enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for low-level nuclear fuel to run a medical reactor.

Brazilian President {{w|Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva}}: "Sadly, this time it was Iran who wanted to negotiate, and those who didn’t want to negotiate were those who think that force resolves everything. I think that taking this decision was a mistake. I think the Security Council threw out a historic opportunity to negotiate calmly on Iran’s nuclear program and also to discuss in a deeper way the deactivation in countries with nuclear bombs."

Iran responded to the UN vote by threatening to reduce its ties to the {{w|International Atomic Energy Agency}} (IAEA) and to continue its uranium enrichment program. Iran’s ambassador to the the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said "No matter how many resolutions are passed, Islamic Republic of Iran will not stop its enrichment activities, which is in full accordance with its right under the statute of IAEA and {{w|Non-Proliferation Treaty}}".

US prisoner in North Korea 'attempts suicide'
{{North Korea}}
{{date|July 10, 2010}}
{{missing image|File:North korean leader.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The North Korean government has reported that an American prisoner, Aijali Mahli Gomes, has "attempted suicide".  {{image source|Alexandermacpherson}}}}
According to the [[North Korea]]n government, a [[United States|US]] citizen, Aijali Mahli Gomes, has attempted {{w|suicide}} in a North Korean prison. In April, Gomes was sentenced to eight years of hard labour for illegally attempting to cross into the reclusive country in January, though his reasons for doing so remain unclear. 

In addition to the prison term, the man was also fined the equivalent of {{w|united States dollar|US$}}700,000 for a "hostile act".

"Driven by his strong guilty conscience, disappointment and despair at the US government that has not taken any measure for his freedom, he attempted to commit suicide," the North's [[Korean Central News Agency]] reported. This report did not specify where and how Gomes attempted suicide, or his state at present, only adding that Gomes "is now [being] given first-aid treatment at a hospital", and that [[Sweden|Swedish]] diplomats at their [[Pyongyang]] embassy who handle diplomatic affairs between the US and North Korea have been made aware of Gomes' condition.

Gomes was an English teacher in [[South Korea]] before trying to cross into the North. Gomes had also attended rallies that supported human rights activist {{w|Robert Park (activist)|Robert Park}}, who crossed into the North to protest the Communist country's poor human rights record. Park was later expelled from North Korea 40 days after he entered.

North Korea's international relations remain tense after the [[South Korean navy ship sinks off North Korean coast|sinking of the South Korean warship ''Cheonan'']], and this report was issued just hours before the [[United Nations]] {{w|UN Security Council|Security Council}} was expected to pass a resolution censuring the explosion of the Cheonan. North Korea has denied any involvement in the sinking of the warship and has declared that any sanctions from the international community will lead to war.

Kosovo independence ruled legal by International Court of Justice
{{date|July 22, 2010}}{{Politics and conflicts}}Judges from the [[United Nations]] {{w|International Court of Justice}} ruled Thursday that [[Kosovo]]'s [[Kosovo declares independence from Serbia|declaration of independence]] from [[Serbia]] in 2008 was not in violation of international law.

Despite protests from Serbia, which claimed that Kosovo's independence threatened its sovereignty and was illegal under international law, ten of the ICJ's fourteen judges supported the non-binding motion declaring Kosovo's independence legal. The move was supported by the [[United States]] and most [[Europe]]an countries, while other countries, including [[Russia]] and [[China]], opposed the ruling.

In its opinion on the matter, the court said that it "considers that general international law does not contain any prohibition on declarations of independence. Accordingly, it concludes that [Kosovo's] declaration of independence on the 17th of February 2008 did not violate general international law."

Even before the ruling, 69 members of the UN, out of a total of 192, had recognized Kosovo's independence, and observers say that more may do so in light of the ICJ's ruling.

Kosovo's president, {{w|Fatmir Sejdiu}}, said that "[t]he decision finally removes all doubts that countries which still do not recognise the republic of Kosovo could have," while Serbian president {{w|Boris Tadic}} said that "Serbia will never recognise the unilaterally proclaimed independence of Kosovo."

Bus crash kills six, injures Iraqi minister in Jordan
{{date|July 31, 2010}}
{{Jordan}}
On Thursday evening, a bus crash in [[Jordan]] killed two [[UK|British]] women and four [[Iraq]]is and injured 28 people, including the Iraqi minister of science and technology {{w|Raed Fahmy Jahid|Raed Fahmy}}.

Officials say the bus was returning from the Dead Sea to the Jordanian capital of [[Amman]], when it overturned on a steep turn near the Dead Sea. The two women killed were employees of the [[United Nations]] Development Program.

Police say four Iraqis, including Fahmy, remain hospitalized. Fahmy, who is said to have broken his shoulder, is being treated at the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman.

The British Embassy in Amman refused to give any more details about the crash or its victims.

Naomi Campbell testifies against former Liberian president
{{date|August 5, 2010}}
{{Sierra Leone}}

[[File:NaomiCampbell.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Campbell claims being in court was "a big inconvenience." {{image credit|Jesse Gross}}]] Supermodel {{w|Naomi Campbell}} testified for prosecutors on Thursday in a war crimes case against former [[Liberia]]n president [[Charles Taylor]].

Taylor allegedly gave an uncut {{w|blood diamond}} to Campbell in 1997 when they met for dinner in [[South Africa]], according to Professor David Crane of Syracuse University.

Crane told ''Voice of America'', "The testimony itself is important because the prosecution wants to show that Charles Taylor has the mindset or what we call the ''{{w|mens rea}}'' to use the blood diamonds that were mined by Sierra Leoneans chained to pits in the Kailahun and Kenema area. And, he was using them for various reasons: to buy guns, to use cash to deposit, and also to buy influence."

Taylor denies he possessed any uncut diamonds.

Campbell said in her testimony, "When I was sleeping I had a knock on my door. I opened my door and two men were there and gave me a pouch and said, 'A gift for you.'" She said the men gave her "very small, dirty looking stones." 

She continued, "At breakfast I told Miss [Mia] Farrow and Miss [Carole] White what had happened and one of the two said, well that's obviously Charles Taylor, and I said, yes I guess it was."

Campbell was not sure Taylor sent her the blood diamonds and she claimed she assumed it was the accused and continued stating it was unlikely anyone else gave her the gift.

The [[Special Court for Sierra Leone|Special Court]] for [[Sierra Leone]] in [[The Hague]], [[The Netherlands]] ruled that no one may sketch, take photographs, or make videos of Campbell, due to her high profile.  Photographers were barred from taking photos of Campbell entering or leaving the courthouse, but her testimony was recorded as usual.

Hiroshima marks 65th atomic bombing anniversary
{{date|August 7, 2010}}
{{Japan}}
[[Image:Hiroshima aftermath.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Hiroshima aftermath]]
The 65th anniversary of the {{w|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first use of an atomic bomb against people}} has been remembered in a ceremony Thursday in {{w|Hiroshima}}, [[Japan]].

The atomic bomb, code-named "{{w|Little Boy}}", was dropped on Hiroshima at precisely 08:15 local time on August 6, 1945 by the specially converted {{w|United States Army Air Force}} {{w|B-29 Superfortress}} bomber {{w|Enola Gay}} piloted by Colonel {{w|Paul Tibbets}}, who later retired as a brigadier general in the {{w|United States Air Force}}.

Diplomats from 75 countries attended this anniversary including the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] for the first time. [[United Nations]] secretary-general [[Ban Ki-moon]], who was also attending this ceremony for the first time said "Together, we are on a journey from ground zero to global zero &mdash; a world free of weapons of mass destruction, and that is the only sane path to a safer world. For as long as nuclear weapons exist, we will live under a nuclear shadow."

U.S. Ambassador to Japan {{w|John Roos}} also attended, marking the first time that a U.S. representative has attended the ceremony. Meanwhile, some conservatives in the United States have criticised the choice for Roos to attend. Gene Tibbets, the son of retired Brigadier General Tibbets said on {{w|Fox News}},  "It's making the Japanese look like they're the poor people, like they didn't do anything. They hit Pearl Harbor, they struck us. We didn't slaughter the Japanese. We stopped the war."

Three days after Hiroshima, another atomic bomb, "{{w|Fat Man}}", was dropped on nearby {{w|Nagasaki}}. The Japanese Government surrendered unconditionally on August 15, and signed the formal surrender on the {{w|USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri''}} on September 2 in {{w|Tokyo Bay}}.

Approximately 140,000 people died within days from the initial blast of the Hiroshima bomb and during the following year from radiation. The total death toll was almost half of Hiroshima's population.

Mia Farrow, Carole White testify in Charles Taylor's war crimes trial
{{date|August 11, 2010}}
{{Sierra Leone}}

[[File:Mia Farrow.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Farrow appeared in a [[United Nations|UN]]-backed court at The Hague to testify in a war crimes trial against Taylor. {{image|hdptcar on Flickr}}]] Actress {{w|Mia Farrow}} and Carole White have testified in former-[[Liberia]]n president [[Charles Taylor]]'s war crimes trial at the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone|Special Court]] for [[Sierra Leone]] in [[The Hague]], [[The Netherlands]].

Farrow and White's testimonies contradict supermodel {{w|Naomi Campbell}}'s testimony from last week.

White said Campbell was "mildly flirtatious" with Taylor at a dinner in [[South Africa]] in 1997. Taylor, she alleged, told Campbell he would send her diamonds. White continued to say Campbell communicated with Taylor and awaited the diamond. Campbell was "very excited" about the diamonds according to White.

"[Taylor's men] came in and they sat down in the lounge and we sat opposite them... they then took out a quite scruffy paper and they handed it to Miss Campbell and said 'these are the diamonds.'"

Farrow claimed Campbell told her Taylor received diamonds in the middle of the night. She testified, "[Campbell] said that in the night she had been awakened, some men were knocking at the door, and they had been sent by Charles Taylor, and they had given her a huge diamond."

Last week in Campbell's testimony, she did not know who sent her diamonds, but testified her then-agent White told her who probably sent the diamonds. White and Farrow testified Campbell said the diamonds were from Taylor. She claims she gave the diamonds to Jeremy Ractliffe who gave them to police.

Police spokesperson Musa Zondi confirms Ractliffe had uncut diamonds. "Yes, they are real diamonds.  We cannot tell whether they are '{{w|Blood diamond|blood diamonds}}' or not. That will be part of the investigation," Zondi said.

Taylor faces eleven counts for violating international law including, murder, rape, sexual slavery, enlistment of children under the age of fifteen, pillaging, enslavement, and "outrages upon personal dignity."

Taylor allegedly traded "blood diamonds" for weapons and supplying the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of Sierra Leone with weapons during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war from 1991 to 2002]]. This war conscripted child soldiers, an international crime. The prosecutors for the Special Court say Taylor trained the rebels and had them rape, murder, mutilate, and decapitate the civilians of Sierra Leone. Over 100,000 people died in the Sierra Leonean civil war. Taylor plead not guilty to all charges.

Linking the blood diamonds, used to support the RUF, to Taylor is a high priority for the prosecution.

'Enough, enough, enough, enough': 1700 women march against mass rape in DR Congo
{{Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
{{date|October 18, 2010}}

Over 1,700 women from more than 40 nations marched through {{w|Bukavu}}, [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) yesterday, to protest sexual violence against their gender. The [[United Nations]] calls the nation the "rape capital of the world" and estimates 15,000 rapes were committed last year in the DRC. One local activist said "They [the women] have had enough, enough, enough, enough. Enough of the [civil] war, of the rape, of nobody paying attention to what's happening to them."

Both rebel groups and government troops are accused of rape, with march organisers hoping to draw international attention to {{w|War rape|rape as a weapon in war}}. Eastern Congo is worse affected, and aid groups have suggested the actual figure may be higher as victims are unlikely to come forward. The UN states mass rapes have occurred in the area for at least 15 years. Some rape victims left hospital to participate in the march.

The third "World March of Women" followed several days of talks aimed at changing the social acceptance of violence, especially against women, in the Congo. Peace and development were also on the agenda for women from nations including [[Togo]], [[South Africa]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Brazil]]. Some men also joined the discussions.

Myanmar Junta threatened with sanctions by UN body
{{date|November 21, 2005}}

The [[United Nations|UN]] [[International Labour Organisation]] (ILO) has warned the generals that make up the military government of [[Myanmar]], more commonly known as Burma, that they may face sanctions should they not improve their record over forced labour.

The call to change policy and attitudes towards forced labour that the ILO issued following a meeting of their governing body in [[Geneva]] late last week was countered by promises from the regime that they would not withdraw from the organisation.

The warning issued by the ILO has been followed by calls from the [[European Union|EU]] for the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] and Secretary General of the UN to get involved in efforts to reform the country.  The EU Parliament passed its resolution on Burma by a significant majority, only three members opposed and two abstained.

Korean Peninsula on the 'brink of war': DPRK
{{Politics and conflicts}}
{{date|November 25, 2010}}
[[File:Southkorean president lee.JPG|thumb|180px|left|South Korean President {{w|Lee Myung-Bak}} has put the  South Korean military on its highest alert. {{image|Henrik Hansson Globaljuggler}}]]
Tensions continue to rise between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] following the {{w|Shelling of Yeonpyeong|shelling}} of South Korea's [[Yeonpyeong Island]] by the {{w|North Korean Navy}}, and return fire by South Korean forces. Both sides have issued statements of increasingly hostile language, and South Korean President {{w|Lee Myung-Bak}} put the military on its highest alert. 

On his website, the President warned North Korea that "indiscriminate attack on civilians can never be tolerated" and promised "enormous retaliation" if North Korea should attack again. The state-controlled {{w|Korean Central News Agency|North Korean Central News Agency}} issued its own statement, threatening more strikes if South Korean naval forces cross the maritime border by "even 0.001 millimetre".

World leaders have been quick to condemn the North Korean shelling. [[United Nations]] {{w|Secretary General of the United Nations|Secretary General}} [[Ban Ki-Moon]] issued a statement in which he called the attacks "one of the gravest incidents since the end of the Korean War", but expressing his hope that differences be resolved by non-military means. The [[United States]], which currently has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea, called on the North to end the shelling, and affirmed its policy of defense of South Korea. The [[China|Chinese]] foreign ministry also issued a statement, saying that the country had "taken note of relevant reports" and expressed its hope that both sides return stability to the region. South Korea's defense minister {{w|Kim Tae-Young (R.O.K. Army general)|Kim Tae-Young}} has resigned amid criticism of his handling of the situation. When asked about the shelling on the Glenn Beck Show, former U.S. Vice Presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] remarked that "Obviously, we gotta stand with our North Korean allies" &mdash; a gaffe quickly corrected by Beck.

UN convoy attacked by gunman in Ivory Coast as peacekeeping forces ordered to leave country
{{Ivory Coast}}
{{date|December 18, 2010}}

The [[United Nations]] mission in [[Abidjan]], [[Ivory Coast]] has said that one of its convoys and mission headquarters was attacked by masked gunmen in military uniforms. According to the mission, a civilian vehicle with six men inside approached the convoy. When the convoy approached the compound's entrance the gunmen opened fire.

"[A convoy] was followed by a group of six armed men dressed in military clothing on board a civilian vehicle. On arriving outside the UNOCI headquarters in Sebroko, the occupants of the civilian vehicle fired shots in the direction of the UNOCI patrol as it entered the mission compound," said a statement from the United Nations Operation in [[Cote d'Ivoire]] (UNOCI). Shots were fired back at the gunmen, but none were hit. There were no reports of any injuries.

The attack comes as President [[Laurent Gbagbo]] ordered all UN and [[France|French]] peacekeeping forces to leave the country. "The government demands the departure of the UNOCI and LICORNE [French] forces in Ivory Coast and is opposed to any renewal of their mandate," said government spokesman Jacqueline Oble. Gbagbo claimed victory in the nation's elections on November 28. [[Alassane Ouattara]] won the presidential {{w|run-off election}} on December 3 according to the country's electoral commission. However, the Constitutional Council has contested the announcement.

Though the results are backed by the nation's top legal body, deadly protests have erupted with demonstrators and Ouattara calling the election a fraud. The French government and the UN have also rejected the election results. On Thursday, according to [[Amnesty International]], nine unarmed demonstrators were fatally shot by Ivorian security forces during a mass protest in Abidjan.

South Korea and US hold joint exercises; North does not retaliate
{{date|December 20, 2010}}
{{Politics and conflicts}}

[[South Korea]] held joint military exercises with the [[United States]] on Monday on [[Yeonpyeong Island]], which was shelled by [[North Korea]] last month. North Korea had warned of an "unpredictable self-defensive blow" if the exercises went ahead, but the country did not retaliate, saying it was "not worth" attacking, despite "reckless provocations" from the South.

[[File:F-15E - Controlling The Sky.JPG|thumb|left|South Korean officials reported the drills, involving {{w|McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|McDonnell Douglas F-15K fighter aircraft}}, lasted less than two hours. {{image|United States Air Force}}]]

The [[United Nations Security Council]] held an eight hour emergency meeting as tensions escalated on the Korean peninsula before the exercises began. The controversial issue divided opinion within the council; [[China]] and [[Russia]] both asked South Korea to call off the exercise over fears it could start a war on the peninsula, but the US supported its ally, saying the drills were "fully consistent with South Korea's legal right to self defence".

Officials in [[Pyongyang]] had threatened a "catastrophe" if the exercises, taking place on an island close to the border with the North, went ahead. They did not attack the South, however; state media quoted a North Korean military official as saying: "The world should properly know who is the true champion of peace and who is the real provocateur of a war." South Korea had said they would retaliate "immediately and sternly" to any attack from the North. 

South Korean officials reported the drills, involving {{w|K9 Thunder}} guns and {{w|McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15K fighter aircraft}}, lasted less than two hours. During the drill, civilians on Yeonpyeong Island moved into air-raid shelters, which, the [[BBC]] reported, was part of the planned procedure for the exercise.

Yeonpyeong Island, which, although controlled by the South, is visible from the North, and came under attack from the North last month. Nearly 200 rounds of artillery were fired at the island in the attack; four people were killed and another 14 were injured in the attack. At the time of the attack, the South had been holding annual military exercises with the US. Troops on the island returned fire, firing nearly 80 rounds of artillery, but no damage was reported on the North Korean side.

French citizens told to leave Ivory Coast as UN warns of civil war
{{date|December 23, 2010}}
[[File:LocationCotedIvoire.svg|right|300px|thumb|Map highlighting location of the Ivory Coast. {{image credit|[[Commons:User:Vardion|Vardion]]}}]]
The [[France|French]] government has urged its citizens to leave the [[Ivory Coast]] (Côte d'Ivoire) as the [[United Nations]] (U.N.) warned that the country was heading towards a civil war. According to the U.N., there has been an increase in the use of intimidation methods by elements of the national security forces loyal to incumbent president [[Laurent Gbagbo]].

"The international community must act and act decisively. I emphasize again today what I have said earlier: any attempt to starve the United Nations mission into submission will not be tolerated. Any attack on the United Nations and its staff must be considered an attack on the international community," said U.N. Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] in a statement. He added that the techniques of intimidation include "abductions and killings and the propagation of hate speech through the state broadcasting corporation."

Meanwhile, the French government urged its citizens to leave the country. "We ask those who can, to leave Ivory Coast temporarily until the situation normalises," said {{w|Francois Baroin}}, a government spokesperson.

On Saturday, Gbagbo ordered the U.N. and French peacekeepers to leave the country saying, "The government demands the departure of the UNOCI and LICORNE [French] forces in Ivory Coast and is opposed to any renewal of their mandate." Gbagbo claimed victory in the nation's elections on November 28. [[Alassane Ouattara]] won the presidential {{w|run-off election}} on December 3 according to the country's electoral commission. However, the Constitutional Council has contested the announcement. The French government and the U.N. have also rejected the election results. Gbagbo offered for several entities to investigate the election results, which was rejected by Ouattara who said "we've finished with these games."

"I am ... ready to welcome a committee... headed by the [[African Union]], involving ECOWAS, the Arab League, the United Nations, [[United States]], the [[European Union]], [[Russia]] and [[China]], which will have permission to analyse objectively the facts of the electoral process ...to solve this crisis peacefully," Gbagbo said in a statement.

The U.N. said it has no plans to leave the country saying, "the president-elect is Ouattara and he hasn't asked us to leave" and that they intend to "fulfill its mandate and will continue to monitor and document any human rights violations, incitement to hatred and violence, or attacks on U.N. peacekeepers."

Also on Saturday, a U.N. convoy and the mission headquarters in {{w|Abidjan}} was attacked by masked gunmen in military uniforms. According to the mission, a civilian vehicle with six men inside approached the convoy. When the convoy approached the compound's entrance the gunmen opened fire. No one was injured in the attack. Shots were fired back at the gunmen, but none were hit.

UN probing allegations US is 'torturing' soldier over leaks
{{date|December 23, 2010}}
{{Wikileaks}}
The [[United Nations]] is reportedly beginning an investigation into claims that Pfc. {{w|Bradley Manning}} is being "tortured." Manning was arrested in May, after allegedly leaking over 250,000 classified diplomatic cables to the whistleblowing website [[WikiLeaks]].

Last week, it was announced that supporters for Manning lodged a complaint with the Office of The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], saying that the conditions of his cell and the treatment he is receiving, amount to "torture." According to {{w|Salon.com|Salon}}, Manning is not allowed to exercise, is denied bed sheets and pillows, and has been held in solitary confinement for 23 hours of every day since his arrest. According to Manning's attorney, David Coombs, a former [[United States]] Army major, and veteran of the [[Iraq]] War, Manning is only allowed to walk in a small room for exercise.

"[Manning is] taken to an empty room and only allowed to walk, normally just walks figure eights in the room. If he indicates that he no long feels like walking, he is immediately returned to his cell," stated Coombs to Salon.

{{w|The Pentagon}} denies that Manning is being tortured, saying he is being treated "fairly. We've been reviewed ... No concerns have been voiced from a ({{w|US Department of Defense|Department of Defense}}) perspective."

UN says it won't leave Ivory Coast
{{date|December 20, 2010}}
{{United Nations}}
The [[United Nations]] and [[France|French]] peacekeeping forces say they will not leave the [[Ivory Coast]] despite orders from incumbent president [[Laurent Gbagbo]] to leave the country.

Secretary General of the UN [[Ban Ki-moon]] said in a statement that the UN in the Ivory Coast will "fulfill its mandate and will continue to monitor and document any human rights violations, incitement to hatred and violence, or attacks on U.N. peacekeepers." He also called the orders for all peacekeeping troops to leave the nation irrelevant and without effect, adding that the UN does not believe Gbagbo is the legal president.

"The president-elect is [[Alassane Ouattara|Ouattara]] and he hasn't asked us to leave," added the UN.

Saturday, Gbagbo called for all French and UN peacekeeping troops to leave the country. A government spokesperson said Saturday, "the government demands the departure of the UNOCI and LICORNE [French] forces in Ivory Coast and is opposed to any renewal of their mandate. [The] UNOCI has interfered seriously in the internal affairs of Ivory Coast." The government added it would defend the nation's sovereignty and that next Friday "the total liberation of Ivory Coast [begins]."

Egypt to open Gaza Strip crossing for humanitarian and medical aid
{{date|June 1, 2010}}
{{Israel/Palestine conflict}}
[[File:Rafah Crossing.jpg|thumb|left|Rafah Border Crossing{{image credit|gloucester2gaza}}]]
[[Egypt]] will open a [[Gaza Strip]] crossing for humanitarian and medical aid.

Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] ordered the opening of the [[Rafah Border Crossing]]. Food and medical supplies will be allowed, but not concrete or steel. It will be made available for ill and injured [[Palestine|Palestinians]] seeking medical treatment.

Rafah is the only point on the Gaza border not controlled by [[Israel]]; a 2005 agreement put Palestine and Israel in charge of the border, with observation from the [[European Union]]. [[United Nations]] officials had demanded an end to the [[Gaza blockade]].

This comes after there has been {{w|International reactions to the Gaza flotilla clash|international criticism}} of the death of activists when {{w|Gaza flotilla clash|Israeli commandos}} raided Turkish ships in the international waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The six-ship “Freedom Flotilla” was carrying some 10,000 tonnes of supplies and was planning to breach the Gaza blockade. Details are unknown, with information limited to Israeli military briefings.

Many dead in Egyptian resort blasts
{{date|July 22, 2005}}
[[Image:LocationEgypt.png|thumb|200px|Location of Egypt]]
A string of at least three explosions in [[Egypt]]ian resort towns in the [[w:Sinai|Sinai]] early Saturday morning has left at least 88 people dead and over 200 more wounded.

One blast occurred at 1am in [[w:Sharm el-Sheikh|Sharm el-Sheikh]], apparently in the market area, and two others about 15 minutes later in Naama Bay, a nearby resort. The explosions reportedly occurred outside hotels. A witness told the AP that the four-star hotel ''Ghazala Gardens'' has "completely burned down".

In October of last year, 34 people were killed in explosions in [[w:Taba (Egypt)|Taba]] and Ras Shitan, nearby resort areas popular with [[Israel]]i tourists. Due to this, officials blamed those attacks on violence related to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].

=== Casualty reports ===

So far the local police have confirmed that at least 88 people have been killed and between 120 and 200 were wounded. Reuters news agency quotes doctors at the scene saying many of the injured are in critical condition. Reuters also indicates that the explosions may have been caused by car-bombs.

Most of the casualties are Egyptians, there are [[UK|Britons]], [[France|French]], [[Spain|Spaniards]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Italy|Italians]], [[Czech Republic|Czechs]], [[Qatar]]is, and [[Kuwait]]is.

=== Responsibility ===

A group calling itself ''[[w:Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]] Brigades'' has claimed responsibility for the attacks. On a website the group stated that  "holy warriors targeted the Ghazala Gardens hotel and the Old Market in Sharm el-Sheikh" and claimed it has ties to [[Al-Qaida]]. The authenticity of this statement has not been verified.

=== Reactions ===

In a televised statement Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] said that the terrorists will only make his country "more determined to pursue terrorism and dig it out by the roots". He added that "we will not give in to its blackmail, or seek a truce".
Egyptian Interior Minister Habib al-Adli called the attacks an "ugly act of terrorism".

U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] condemned the attacks saying that the "United States stands with our friend and ally Egypt. Together we will confront and defeat this scourge that knows no boundaries and respects no creed."

[[Russia]], [[Japan]], the [[United Nations]], and the Palestinian Authority have also condemned the blasts.

The British Foreign Minister, [[w:Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], also condemned the attacks. While being questioned about who was responsible for the bombings, Mr Straw said: "Almost certainly they are evil people who will claim &mdash; wrongly &mdash; to have done this in the name of [[Islam]]."

Danish minister of Foreign Affairs [[w:Per Stig Møller|Per Stig Møller]] says: "I condemn, in the strongest possible ways, the terror attacks in Sharm el-Sheikh, that yet again target defenseless and innocent people. This can in no way be justified. My deepest sympathies to the wounded, the families and the people of Egypt."

In a telegram to the Egyptian President this morning, Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of [[Iran]], offered her condolences to the "brother nation of Egypt" on the death of, and injury to, a large number of Egyptian and foreign nationals during the bombings in Sharm al-Sheikh last night. She prayed for patience for the families of those killed and quick recovery for those injured. Mrs. Rajavi underscored, "Islamic fundamentalism and the terrorism emanating from it constitute the biggest threat to world peace and security. The heart of this ominous phenomenon is beating in Iran under the mullahs' regime, the leading sponsor of terrorism in the world today." She expressed hope that with the overthrow of the inhuman regime and the establishment of democracy in Iran, the world would see the eradication of the ideology of hate and violence, falsely propagated under the name of Islam, the great religion of compassion, friendship and tolerance. It is worthy of note that on Wednesday, the daily Kayhan, the mouthpiece of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, brazenly boasted, "Iran has an incalculable capacity to destabilize the entire Middle East. Given the circumstance, this destabilization could include a wide range of activities from limited local clashes to plunging the entire region into chaos and clashes."

UN criticises Israel's latest settlement plan, angry reaction from US and UK
{{date|November 19, 2009}}{{Israel}}[[File:Israel 7 010 Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|190px|View of [[w:East Jerusalem|east Jerusalem]]{{image credit|Daniel Maleck Lewy}}]][[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] spokespeople have added to criticism from [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] that [[Israel]]'s decision to authorise a further 900 homes in [[w:East Jerusalem|east Jerusalem]] will "undermine efforts for peace and cast doubt on the viability of the two-state solution".

A spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon stated, "The Secretary-General deplores the Government of Israel’s decision today to expand Gilo settlement, built on Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 war."

The US rebuked Israel for their decision. "We are dismayed at the Jerusalem planning committee's decision to move forward on the approval process for the expansion of Gilo in Jerusalem," said [[w:White House|White House]] spokesperson [[w:Robert Gibbs|Robert Gibbs]]. "At a time when we are working to relaunch negotiations, these actions make it more difficult for our efforts to succeed," he said, referring to the attempts by the US to lead the peace process. "Neither party should engage in efforts or take actions that could unilaterally pre-empt, or appear to pre-empt, negotiations."

[[w:United States Department of State|US Department of State]] spokesperson [[w:Ian Kelly|Ian Kelly]] added, "We object to this, and we object to other Israeli practices in Jerusalem related to housing, including the continuing pattern of evictions and demolitions of Palestinian homes."

{{QuoteLeft|The Secretary-General deplores the Government of Israel’s decision today to expand Gilo settlement, built on Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 war.|source=Spokesperson for [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]]}}The British consulate in Jerusalem issued a statement on behalf of Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] that read, "The Foreign Secretary has been very clear that a credible deal involves Jerusalem as a shared capital. Expanding settlements on occupied land in East Jerusalem makes that deal much harder. So this decision is wrong and we oppose it."

According to [[w:Israel Army Radio|Israel Army Radio]], Prime Minister [[w:Benjamin Netanyahu|Benjamin Netanyahu]] rejected a request from the US [[Middle East]] envoy [[w:George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]] on Monday to halt building in the area on the grounds that that Gilo was "an integral part of Jerusalem". "Prime Minister Netanyahu […] is willing to adopt the policy of the greatest possible restraint concerning growth in the West Bank, but this applies to the West Bank," said the Prime Minister's spokesperson [[w:Mark Regev|Mark Regev]]. "Jerusalem is Israel's capital and will remain as such."

Following the suspension of peace talks last year, the [[w:Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian National Authority]] has demanded a halt to all construction of settlements before it will return to negotiations. President [[Mahmud Abbas]] said that the breakdown in talks left him with no choice but to seek international recognition of a Palestinian state unilaterally, despite requests from the United States and the [[European Union]] to resume peace talks. "We feel we are in a very difficult situation," he said in [[Cairo]] after talks with his [[Egypt]]ian counterpart [[Hosni Mubarak]]. "What is the solution for us? To remain suspended like this, not in peace? That is why I took this step."

This comes as another blow to United States President [[Barack Obama]], whose attempts at brokering a deal to halt settlement expansion are meeting with little success. With the credibility of the US leader diminishing, [[France|French]] President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] has recently started meeting with a number of Middle East leaders in the past week, attempting to reconcile with [[Syria]] and meeting with [[w:Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] of [[Saudi Arabia]].

Indian foreign minister criticized after reading wrong speech at UN summit
{{date|February 14, 2011}}
{{India}}
[[File:India-eam-krishna.jpg|left|thumb|165px|S.M. Krishna in 2009{{image source|[[w:User:Naveah|Naveah]]}}]]
[[India]]'s foreign minister has been criticized by Members of Parliament after he read out the wrong speech at a [[UN]] summit. {{w|S.M. Krishna}} accidentally read out the speech belonging to the foreign minister of [[Portugal]] for three minutes before he was corrected by officials. Both members of the opposition party and that of Krishna's spoke out against his mistake.

{{w|Satyavrat Chaturvedi}}, the Congress spokesman, said, "the ministry is supposed to be vigilant enough. This ultimately reflects on the Government of India… especially when we are seeking to become a permanent member of the [[UN Security Council|Security Council]]." While the senior opposition party leader {{w|Venkaiah Naidu}} said, "was it a negligence or mistake? Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] should explain to the nation why and how it happened at a world forum and he should also explain what are the steps being taken in this regard."

Krishna has commented on his mistake himself releasing a statement saying "Unfortunately, it happened. There was nothing wrong in it. There were so many papers spread in front of me so by mistake the wrong speech was taken out."

This is not the first time that the wrong speech has been read out at a UN summit. In 2009 US President [[Barack Obama]] accidentally read out the speech of the [[Ireland|Irish]] prime minister because the speeches got mixed up on the teleprompter.

Swine flu claims first UK victim
{{date|June 15, 2009}}
{{Swine Flu infobox}}Yesterday, the first fatality in the UK caused by [[swine flu]] was announced.  Jacqueline Fleming, who was 38, from [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], died at the Royal Alexandria Hospital in Paisley.  She had been admitted to hospital two weeks earlier after the premature birth of her baby son, Jack.  Reports suggest that she was admitted having suffered a {{w|stroke}} and suffered further complications, in part related to the birth of Jack.

[[File:H1N1 United Kingdom Map - Region 2.svg|thumb|left|100px|Map of the UK colour coded by severity of H1N1 outbreak, as of 14 June.{{image credit|[[w:user:AxG|AxG]]}}]]
Professor Hugh Pennington, a bacteriologist at {{w|Aberdeen University}} was quoted as saying that underlying health problems were likely to have been a significant factor in Jaqueline's death.  He also dismissed speculation that the virus was getting worse, saying "This is what the authorities have been saying will happen for a long time.  It does not point to the virus getting nastier. All the evidence to date suggests the virus is not changing at all."

Her son Jack died today in the special care unit of the same hospital at the age of two weeks, having been born 11 weeks early.  He was not affected by the H1N1 virus.

Jaqueline's husband stated today "My beautiful son was born on the first of June 2009, 11 weeks early. He suffered from a number of complications and despite his brave fight he passed away earlier this evening at the Special Care Baby Unit at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley." 

On Friday, the {{w|Health Protection Agency}} said confirmed swine flu cases in the UK had reached 1004.  Recently, the [[World Health Organisation]] declared the outbreak to be a worldwide {{w|pandemic}}.

[[France|French]] police have today confirmed that they are holding five suspects in the {{w|11 December 2007 Algiers bombings|December 11 Algiers bombings}}. The bombings killed at least 37 people, including 17 [[United Nations]] staff members.

The men were arrested with three others, who have since been freed, in a raids on Tuesday in [[Paris]] and {{w|Rouen}}. They are believed to be part of the support network for {{w|Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb}} (formerly Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat), which has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Darfur rebels threaten to pull out of peace talks
{{date|October 6, 2007}}
[[Image:Darfur_map.png|right|300px|thumb|Map showing Darfur, and neighboring Libya.]]
The leader of an important rebel group in the [[Darfur]] region of [[Sudan]] has threatened to withdraw from scheduled peace talks if more than two other rebel groups are invited to the talks.

{{w|Khalil Ibrahim}}, leader of the {{w|Justice and Equality Movement}} (JEM), said that only the JEM, the {{w|Sudanese Liberation Movement}} (SLM), and the Sudanese government should be involved in the procedures.  He expressed displeasure with the way the peace talks are being handled, and said that the [[United Nations]]-[[African Union]] leadership is currently unprepared for the talks scheduled for October 27th in [[Libya]].

"The AU and [[UN]] mediation until now have failed to detail very precisely who will be invited to the peace talks," {{w|Reuters}} news agency quotes him as saying. "If the mediation fails to take this decision by 27 October, then JEM is not attending the peace talks. We don't want to start with chaos." Ibrahim also said the SLM had to "reform itself and make one delegation and one position".

When the conflict in Darfur began in 2003, there were only two rebel groups opposing the Sudanese military.  In the past four years, the rebel movement has splintered into more than 15 disparate groups, some of which are nothing more than armed outlaws.  

SLM leader {{w|Abdel Wahed Mohammed el-Nur}} has  refused to take part in the negotiations until a UN force is deployed in Darfur, and the pro-government militias are disarmed.

He has also chastised the choice of location of the peace talks, saying his group was not consulted and that a more neutral site should have been chosen. 

"Even if we were to attend the negotiations it will not be {{w|Tripoli}}," he said. "We think that any negotiation is supposed to happen in a place which is not related to the conflict."  Libya has been an important influence in the Darfur conflict.  They are believed to have first armed militias with weapons and {{w|Pan-Arab}} ideology in the 1980's, militias which became the current {{w|Janjaweed}}. 

Meanwhile, {{w|Andrew Natsios}}, the US {{w|Special Envoy}} to Sudan, has said that the relationship between the governments of north and {{w|south Sudan}} is growing increasingly toxic.  He added that the two-year-old {{w|Comprehensive Peace Agreement}} would have to be discussed at the peace talks before the situation grew more dire.  The agreement, signed in 2005, was aimed at bringing the two governments together as allies and partners in peace.  

Mr. Natsios said that this has not happened, and that the north and south Sudanese governments are still opponents unable to find common ground.

"We are deeply concerned with the health of the CPA. The important deadlines have been missed... and trust is slowly being lost," said Mr. Natsios.

Speculation on the peace talks also includes questions about the deployment of the 26,000 strong force of {{w|The United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur}} (UNAMID).  The deployment of the force has been delayed because {{w|Khartoum}} and the AU have rejected non-African troops, and not enough African nations with well-trained and well-equipped soldiers have pledged to help.

Honey bee decline spreading globally
{{date|March 12, 2011}}
[[File:Bee1web.jpg|right|thumb|150px|<center>Western Honey Bee.  {{image|Jon Sullivan}}</center>]]
Scientists working for the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Environment Programme|Environment Programme}} (UNEP) reported Thursday that the collapse of {{w|Western honey bee|honey bee}} colonies is becoming a world wide phenomenon and will continue unless humans work to restore habitats for bees. The insects are necessary for {{w|Pollination|pollinating}} crops and the report calls for profound changes in how humans {{w|Planetary management|manage the planet}}.

The decline in managed bee colonies, first noticed in [[Europe]] and the [[U.S.]], is now seen in [[China]] and [[Japan]], and there are signs of {{w|Colony collapse disorder|colony collapses}} in [[Egypt]]. According to the {{w|United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture}}, honey-producing colonies in the U.S. have declined from 5.5 million colonies in 1950 to 2.5 million in 2007. A co-author of the report, Peter Neumann, said changes in rural areas during the past 50 years have contributed to decline of wild bees and other {{w|Pollinator|pollinators}}. Additional factors include the declines in flowering plants, the use of harmful chemicals and insecticides, the increase in air pollution and a worldwide trade system that spreads bee {{w|Pathogen|pathogens}} and pests. 

The world's growing {{w|World population|population}} means more bees are needed to pollinate the crops to feed more people. According to the U.N. report, of the 100 crop species that supply 90 percent of the world's food, bees pollinate more than 70 percent. Noting that humans seem to believe that they can operate independent of nature through technological innovations, Achim Steiner, the executive director of the UNEP said, "Bees underline the reality that we are more, not less dependent on {{w|Ecosystem services|nature's services}} in a world of close to 7 billion people." 

The report calls for such measures as incentives for farmers and land owners to encourage them to restore habitats that are friendly to pollinators.

UN Security Council approves Libya no-fly zone
{{date|March 17, 2011}}
{{Libya}}
The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] has approved the establishment of a {{w|Libyan no-fly zone|no-fly zone}} over [[Libya]] after a vote on Thursday evening.  

A meeting in [[New York City]] resulted in the approval of a resolution that would mark the beginning of "all necessary measures short of an occupation force to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas" in Libya. The vote on the measure passed with ten of the fifteen members of the Security Council in support and {{w|Russia}}, {{w|China}}, {{w|India}}, {{w|Germany}} and {{w|Brazil}}  absenting.

The resolution had been proposed by the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Lebanon]]. In his remarks introducing the measure before the Council, {{w|Alain Juppe}}, the French foreign minister, said that "[w]e cannot let these warmongers do this, we cannot abandon civilians."

Air attacks on government forces in Libya could take place within hours, flown by the French and British air forces, after [[NATO]] meets to review plans for military action.

In response to the vote, a statement aired on Libyan state TV said that "[a]ny foreign military act against Libya will expose all air and maritime traffic in the Mediterranean Sea to danger, and civilian and military [facilities] will become targets of Libya's counterattack." 

Libya's ruler, [[Muammar Gaddafi]], also said that government troops planned to move against [[Benghazi]] Thursday night. "No more fear, no more hesitation, the moment of truth has come. [...] There will be no mercy. Our troops will be coming to Benghazi tonight."

The UK ambassador to the UN, {{w|Mark Lyall Grant}}, said after the vote that "[t]he international community has come together in deploring the actions of the Gaddafi regime and demanding that the regime end this violence against the Libyan people."

In Benghazi, rebels celebrated the passage of the resolution with fireworks after a live broadcast of the vote was shown on an outdoor projection.

United Nations says Ivory Coast shelling may be 'war crime'
{{date|March 18, 2011}}
{{Ivory Coast}}
After 25 people were killed Thursday by shells fired into the city of [[Abidjan]] in the [[Ivory Coast]], the [[United Nations]] has issued a statement condemning the incident.

The shelling on Thursday resulted in around a hundred casualties, 25 of which were deaths. At least six shells were reportedly fired from military barracks into the district of {{w|Abobo}}, a region that supports [[Alassane Ouattara]], the internationally recognized president of the Ivory Coast after elections in late 2010.

According to the UN, forces loyal to [[Laurent Gbagbo]], who also claims to have won the election, were responsible for the shelling, though Gbagbo's supporters deny this.

The UN said that the incident was an act that "perpetrated against civilians, could constitute a crime against humanity." Secretary General {{w|Ban Ki-Moon}} said that the UN will "continue to take the necessary steps to protect the civilian population" in the country.

A spokesperson for Gbagbo, Ahoua Don Mello, however, denied responsibility for the shelling, claiming that the UN allegations were part of a "conspiracy" with Ouattara and [[France]], the Ivory Coast's former colonial ruler, that would result in the removal of Gbagbo from power.

France also condemned the shelling, saying it was "deliberate massacre of civilians," and requested that the {{w|United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council}} impose sanctions against Gbagbo and his allies.

Unrest since the presidential election is estimated to have killed 410 people and caused 450,000 people to leave their homes.

UN carries out first review of US human rights record
{{date|March 19, 2011}}
{{United Nations}}
The [[United Nations]] has completed its first ever assessment of the [[United States]] [[human rights]] record, which began last November. They made 228 recommendations for improvements. On Friday, the U.S. accepted about 174 of these, agreeing to such recommendations as the humane treatment of terror suspects and repudiation of torture, but rejected the recommendation to drop the [[death penalty]].

The {{w|Legal Adviser of the Department of State}}, {{w|Harold Hongju Koh|Harold Koh}}, listed nine core areas in which the  U.S. agreed to make improvements, including [[civil rights]], [[immigration]],  and the humane treatment of suspects held at  [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. Koh said [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] agreed to  push for ratification of conditions under the {{w|Geneva Conventions}} and to add protections for international armed conflict detainees. Koh refused to drop the death penalty as many European countries requested, arguing that it was legal under international law.

Some nations wanted the U.S. to reduce  {{w|prison overcrowding}}, prevent {{w|racial profiling}}, and ratify international treaties protecting the rights of women and children. [[China]] and [[Russia]] wanted Guantanamo to be shut down. [[Cuba]], [[Iran]] and [[Venezuela]] said the U.S. was ignoring too many recommendations.

The Obama administration joined the 47-nation {{w|UN Human Rights Council}} two years ago, allowing for increased international scrutiny. This  is the first time the five-year-old council has reviewed the U.S. record of human rights. Nations are held accountable to make the improvements in the recommendations that they agree to.

In criticism of the U.S.,  the director of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s human rights program, Jamil Dakwar, noted that the U.S., unlike 100 other countries, lacks an independent human rights monitoring commission.

French aircraft on flights over Libya; US missiles launched at targets
{{date|March 19, 2011}}
{{Libya}}
[[File:USS Barry (DDG-52) launching a Tomahawk missile in support of Operation Odyssey Dawn.jpg|thumb|The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG 52) launches a Tomahawk missile in support of Operation Odyssey Dawn.{{image credit|[[:File:USS Barry (DDG-52) launching a Tomahawk missile in support of Operation Odyssey Dawn.jpg|U.S. Navy photo]]}}|left]]
[[France|French]] military aircraft began flying missions over [[Libya]] today in support of a no-fly zone the [[United Nations]] approved Thursday.

President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said that "[o]ur air force will oppose any aggression by Colonel Gadhafi [...] As of now, our aircraft are preventing planes from attacking the town [and] are prepared to intervene against tanks, armored vehicles threatening unarmed civilians." One of the planes deployed has reportedly fired against a ground military vehicle.

The intervention is believed to be the first such action since the no-fly zone [[UN Security Council approves Libya no-fly zone|was approved]]. {{w|Dassault Rafale}} fighter jets have been deployed from {{w|Saint-Dizier – Robinson Air Base|Saint-Dizier}}, France, and have reportedly encountered no problems during their missions.

This action was followed by [[United States]] warships launching {{w|Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk}} cruise missiles at targets in [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] and {{w|Misrata}}.

Other countries are preparing to assist in enforcing the no-fly zone. [[Italy]] has offered to allow aircraft use at their air bases, and [[Canada]] has already sent an aircraft to the region, though they will not immediately begin flying missions.

In [[Benghazi]], government forces have reportedly launched an attack on the rebel stronghold, though Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] has denied this claim. Pro-Gaddafi forces have apparently shot down a rebel aircraft. 

Some 200,000 people are estimated to have fled the city, according to the UN.

[[File:Las Vegas 63.jpg|left|thumb|200px|<center>The Las Vegas Strip to go dark</center>]]
The {{w|World Wide Fund for Nature}} (WWF), organizers of the fifth annual {{w|Earth Hour}}, is asking people all over the world to turn off lights tonight from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. local time in support of energy conservation and  awareness of climate change. In 2010, 128 countries,  4,000 cities and  1,000 landmarks worldwide  participated in Earth Hour, including 13 million people in the [[UK]].

In a statement on their website, the WWF said, "Every year Earth Hour asks individuals, businesses and communities worldwide to show their commitment to the environment. This Earth Hour, we hope you will turn off your lights. But when the lights go back on, we want you to go beyond the hour and think about what you can change in your daily life that will benefit the planet. Let’s work together to create a better future. Our actions can add up." 

Promotion by world leaders such as {{w|Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General}} {{w|Ban Ki-moon}} is encouraging wide participation in  Earth Hour 2011. This year about 130 countries are expected to take part. Such world landmarks as the {{w|Eiffel Tower}},  {{w|Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer statue}} in [[Brazil]], {{w|Big Ben}}, the {{w|Las Vegas Strip}}, the {{w|Burj Al Arab|Burj al Arab Hotel}} in [[Dubai]], the {{w|Acropolis in Athens}}, the {{w|Sydney Opera House}} and   {{w|Forbidden City|Beijing's Forbidden City}} are expected to go black. The 15 100-foot-tall "iconic" towers at the {{w|Los Angeles International Airport}} will turn green and then go black for an hour, the airport announced in a press release. 
{{QuoteLeft|WWF's Earth Hour has a unique ability to unite and empower people around the world|source=Richard Dixon, WWF Scotland}}
In 2011, [[Scotland]] became  the first country in the world to obtain Earth Hour cooperation from all of its cities and local jurisdictions, reported  Dr Richard Dixon, director of WWF Scotland, emphasizing that Scotland was going all out this year for Earth Hour. He said, "With record support from cities, local authorities, iconic landmarks, schools and other organisations people will be left in no doubt that Scotland cares about tackling climate change."

Dixon praised the efforts of   the organizers of Earth Hour: "WWF's Earth Hour has a unique ability to unite and empower people around the world."

UN workers killed by Afghans over burning of a Qur'an in Florida
{{date|April 2, 2011}}
{{Afghanistan}}
[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|150px|thumb|left]]
An Afghan mob attacked a [[United Nations]] compound last Friday, killing seven UN workers and setting fire to the compound. The attack occurred  after several hours of peaceful protests, broadcast online, over the burning of a {{w|Qur'an}} by a [[Florida]] pastor.

The protest occurred in the northern [[Afghanistan]] city of {{w|Mazar-e-Sharif}} and was in response to reports that controversial [[US]] pastor {{w|2010_Qur'an-burning_controversy#Pastor_Terry_Jones|Terry Jones}} had instigated the burning of a Qur'an on March 20 by his colleague Wayne Sapp at the {{w|Dove World Outreach Center}} in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], Florida. 

Jones drew {{w|2010 Qur'an-burning controversy|criticism last year}} when he announced plans to burn Qur'ans on the anniversary of [[9/11]]. At that time there were several protests in Afghanistan. Jones was persuaded not to carry out his plans, influenced by a phone call from  Afghanistan commander {{w|David Petraeus|US Gen. David Petraeus}} who feared burning the Qur'an would result in the deaths of US military personnel.

Friday's attack occurred after several hours of protests by approximately 2000 demonstrators in front of the UN compound in Mazar-e-Sharif that was broadcast online. Demonstrators began to  throw stones, tried to climb the compound walls, and then overwhelmed the  UN guards positioned outside the compound, taking their weapons and shooting at Afghan police. They set parts of the compound on fire.
  
According to {{w|Reuters}}, three UN staff and four {{w|Gurkha}} guards were killed. The  UN victims included personnel from [[Nepal]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Romania]]. The UN is still in the process of determining the exact death toll and the extent of the damage. At least four demonstrators were killed also.

Nine killed as protests spread to Kandahar over Qur'an burning
{{date|April 2, 2011}}{{Audio box 2|filename=Nine killed as protests spread to Kandahar over Qur'an burning.ogg|text=Listen to this article|date=2011-04-04}}{{Afghanistan}}
[[File:Quran cover.jpg|left|thumb|150px|<center>Front of the Qur'an</center>]]
Violent protests  over the burning of a  {{w|Qur'an}} by a US church spread on Saturday to the southern [[Afghanistan]] city of [[Kandahar]], a day after an angry mob attacked a [[United Nations]] compound at {{w|Mazar-e-Sharif}} in northern Afghanistan, killing seven UN workers and four Afghan protesters.

According to Kandahar officials,  the protests over the {{w|2010 Qur'an-burning controversy|desecration of the Qur'an}} in [[Florida]] a month ago started peacefully but became violent when   mobs began roaming the streets, vandalizing buildings and burning cars. {{w|Afghan National Police|Afghan police}} and [[US]] soldiers tried to protect a complex of government buildings when a mob attempted to storm them. 

Nine people were killed, and 73 injured. Some witnesses said that people who refused to join the violence were beaten and stoned. Others said Afghan police shot demonstrators. The police have denied shooting anyone. "There [was] gunfire into the air in order to bring the people under control, and luckily not one has been killed as a result of the gunfire," said Zemarai Bashari,  {{w|Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Interior Ministry}} spokesperson as reported by [[CNN]]. 

Zalmai Ayoubi, spokesperson for the governor of [[Kandahar province]], said that Afghan police arrested 17 people, seven of whom were armed and are suspects in the  shooting  of protesters. He blamed Taliban insurgents and their supporters  for infiltrating the demonstration.

A [[Afghan Taliban|Taliban]] spokesperson, [[Zabiullah Mujahid|Zabiullah Mojahed]],  denied that the Taliban was responsible for any deaths during Saturday's violence: "It was the Afghan police that killed the innocent people of Kandahar while they were expressing their feeling against the burning of holy Quran in Florida."

Kandahar is seen as a stronghold of the Taliban insurgency and in the last two months the province has seen several assassinations and suicide bombings.

Sudan preemptively rejects Security Council resolution on war crimes extradition
{{date|March 29, 2005}}
In anticipation of a [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] vote on trying alleged Darfur war criminals at the {{w|International Criminal Court}}, [[Sudan]] announced today it would reject any [[United Nations]] resolution that required war crimes suspects to be tried abroad. The resolution before the UNSC was drafted by the [[France|French]] delegation, and is expected to be voted on this week.

Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said, "Any resolution that is going to include the taking of a Sudanese &mdash; whether he is a rebel or government official &mdash; outside the Sudan: we are totally against it." In contrast, some rebel groups are in favor of the resolution. Tajeddin Nyam, of the rebel group "Justice and Equality of Movement," said he thought the resolution would contribute to peace.

Perhaps in an effort to avoid such extradition, Sudan has begun arresting officials in relation to [[human rights]] abuses in Darfur.  Government officials announced that 15 members of the military and security forces in Darfur had been arrested this week, and were to be sent immediately to local courts.

The region of Darfur has been the center of civil strife for over two years, during which time tens of thousands of people in the black African population have been killed, and many more wounded or abused, by government-supported Arab militias.  It has often been suggested that this qualifies as {{w|genocide}}, and that Darfur is enduring the world's most severe and localized abuse of civil rights.

UN attacks Gbagbo military positions in Ivory Coast
{{Ivory Coast}}
{{date|April 5, 2011}}
[[File:Gbagboci.jpg|thumb|left|200px|File photo of Laurent Gbagbo {{Image source|Zenman}}]]
A spokesman for the [[United Nations]] has announced that UN helicopters attacked an encampment of President [[Laurent Gbagbo]]'s fighters in [[Ivory Coast]] (Cote d'Ivoire) to stop the use of heavy weapons and shelling of civilians.

"We launched an operation to neutralise heavy weapons Gbagbo's special forces have been using against the civilian population for the last three months. We destroyed them in four locations", said spokesman Hamadoun Toure in an email. In concert with the UN, France has deployed an additional 350 peacekeepers to compliment its 7,500 troops already in the country. It was also reported that the French were in control of the airport in [[Abidjan]].

The recent violence in Ivory Coast stems from Gbagbo's refusal to accept his loss in  the recent presidential elections. He has  stated that he will not transfer power to his  successor [[Alassane Ouattara]], the declared winner. Gbagbo's spokesman, Abdon George Bayeto, told the [[BBC]] the elections were rigged as an "international plot against the incumbent" and was going to continue fighting forces loyal to Ouattara.

Lieutenant Jean-Marc Tago of the Ivory Coast army announced the return of {{w|Philippe Mangou|General Phillippe Mangou}}. Although it has been reported that the general's family was being held hostage by Gbagbo forces,  Tago claims this is untrue, saying, "The general is with us, and has always been with us. Our plan is to defend the institutions of the republic against all its enemies, against the rebels, against the mercenaries, against the [United Nations] and all those who are attacking the institutions of the republic commanded by President Laurent Gbagbo."

British foreign secretary William Hague said in a statement, "We call for an end to the violence, for defeated former president Gbagbo to step down, for all human rights abuses to be investigated, and for the International Criminal Court to investigate the crimes which appear to have taken place."

The crisis has created a humanitarian problem as one million of Abidjan's four million people has been displaced.

Disputed Ivory Coast president Gbagbo negotiating surrender
{{date|April 6, 2011}}
{{Ivory Coast}}
The [[United Nations]] has announced that three [[Ivory Coast]] military leaders are in the process of negotiating a potential surrender for disputed president [[Laurent Gbagbo]].

After several days of fighting, during which forces loyal to internationally-recognized president [[Alassane Ouattara]] moved south towards the city of [[Abidjan]], Gbagbo is reported to have taken shelter in a bunker underneath the presidential palace in Abidjan.  Pro-Ouattara forces are reported to have surrounded the palace.

According to the UN and [[France|French]] officials, an agreement that would see Gbagbo relinquish power is close to being finalized. Military forces loyal to Gbagbo have already declared a ceasefire.  According to France's foreign minister, {{w|Alain Juppe}}, "[w]e are very close to convincing him [Gbagbo] to leave power."

The military officials involved &mdash; the heads of the army, police and guard forces &mdash; are reported to be requesting guarantees of safety in return for Gbagbo's surrender.  A Gbagbo spokesperson, Ahoua Don Mello, said that "direct negotiations based on African Union recommendations" had taken place, though Gbabgo himself said that "on a political level, no decision has yet been taken."

Ivorian rebels say South African mediators ‘discredited’
{{date|September  2, 2005}}

On Thursday, the Ivorian rebel group Forces Nouvelles responded to the [[South Africa]]n mediator’s Wednesday testimony to the [[UN Security Council]] by saying that South Africa had become “discredited” by taking the side of Ivorian president [[Laurent Gbagbo]]’s government in {{w|Abidjan}}.

“We categorically do not want the South African mediation continuing here in [[Cote d'Ivoire]]” said the rebel group in a statement.  The Forces Nouvelles spokesman further demanded that "the African Union, and especially AU president Olusegun Obasanjo, take his responsibility and find a new way," calling on regional leader [[Nigeria]] to intervene in the crisis.

The statements are the latest in a series of setbacks to Cote d’Ivoire’s beleaguered peace process, which also include the failure of the rebels to meet the July 31st disarmament deadline, and the rejection of October 30 as a feasible date for the national elections.

Special Representative of the Secretary-General to Cote d'Ivoire, Pierre Schori, expressed his support for the continued South African mediation and stated that conducting free and fair elections in Cote d’Ivoire was more important than sticking with the set dates.

Iran voices defiance towards nuclear deadline
{{date|August 29, 2006}}
{{Iran nuclear program}}
President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] of [[Iran]] expressed his unwillingness to conform to [[UN]] [[UN Security Council| Security Council]] demands on Tuesday. Ahmadinejad said, "Peaceful nuclear energy is the right of the Iranian nation. The Iranian nation has chosen that based upon international regulations, it wants to use it and no one can stop it." Iran has until Thursday to comply with a U.N. Security Council demand to stop its {{w|uranium enrichment}} program. If Iran does not comply by Thursday, the UN has left open the possibility of economic sanctions. Ahmadinejad says that he is willing to listen to negotiations related to changing Iran's nuclear program but that, "...any kind of dialogue should be based upon the certain rights of the Iranian nation."

While the rights of which Ahmadinejad speaks are not currently available for public viewing, Iranian academics point to the six issues in Iran's standard diplomatic policy.

Iran has consistently claimed that it is enriching uranium and building plutonium-producing reactors for solely peaceful purposes—for the generation of electricity, the exporting of materials for other civilian nuclear industries, and the creation of medical radioisotopes—while many western nations have accused the country of running a clandestine {{w|nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons}} program. They have cited as evidence for this Iran's continual investment in {{w|dual-use technology}} which could be used for either civilian or military purposes, as well as alleging that Iran has not been forthright in disclosures of its nuclear developments.

Iran provoked international controversy in April 2006 when it announced an earlier nuclear success: the enrichment of a small amount of uranium to reactor-grade levels (3.5% of the isotope {{w|uranium-235}} using {{w|gas centrifuge}} technology. Concern was raised by some that if Iran was able to scale up its enrichment facilities to thousands of centrifuges, they could be used to produce bomb-grade uranium (90% uranium-235).

Iran has insisted that under the terms of the 1968 {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty}}, of which it is a signatory, it is guaranteed the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. None of Iran's facilities currently have the ability to produce weapons-grade nuclear material, and most experts say it would be at least a decade for Iran to be able to build a functional nuclear weapon.

Iran dismisses United Nations resolution imposing sanctions
{{date|December 24, 2006}}

A unanimously passed [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution imposing sanctions on [[Iran]] has been dismissed by Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] as a "piece of paper." Ahmadinejad said that it is in "the best interest of the West" to have a "nuclear Iran" and that Iran will not stop enriching {{w|uranium}}.

[[Image:Flag of Iran.svg|right|200px|thumb|Flag of Iran.]] "It is a piece of torn paper ... by which they aim to scare Iranians ... It is in the Westerners' interests to live with a nuclear Iran," said Ahmadinejad.

Ahmadinejad also goes on to say that anyone who "backs" the U.N. resolution will "soon regret" their acts. He also added that in "February, Iranians will celebrate" the nation becoming a nuclear power.

"This resolution will not harm Iran and those who backed it will soon regret their superficial act. Iranians are neither worried nor uncomfortable with the resolution ... we will celebrate our atomic achievements in February," added Ahmadinejad.

[[Image:Flag of the United Nations.svg|left|200px|thumb|Flag of the United Nations.]] On December 23, 2006, the U.N. stated that the resolution is "determined to give effect to its unmet 31 July demand that Iran suspend all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. The Security Council today imposed sanctions on that country [Iran], blocking the import or export of sensitive nuclear material and equipment and freezing the financial assets of persons or entities supporting its proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or the development of nuclear-weapon delivery systems," reported the press release on the U.N.'s website.

The U.N. also said that Iran must suspend all uranium enrichment and that the sanction would be lifted if the country complies with the U.N..

"Unanimously adopting {{w|resolution 1737|resolution 1737 (2006)}} under Article 41 of the Charter’s Chapter VII, the Council decided that Iran should, without further delay, suspend the following proliferation sensitive nuclear activities:  all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development; and work on all heavy-water related projects, including the construction of a research reactor moderated by heavy water. The halt to those activities would be verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)."

The U.N. also stated that "specifically, all States [countries] should prevent the supply, sale or transfer, for the use by or benefit of Iran, of related equipment and technology, if the State determined that such items would contribute to enrichment-related, reprocessing or heavy-water related activities, or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems. The Council decided it would terminate the measures if Iran fully complied with its obligations, or adopt additional ones and possible further decisions if the country did not."

Iran also said that beginning on "Sunday morning, we [Iran] will begin activities at Natanz" which has "3,000 centrifuges" which they "will drive them with full speed" in response to the U.N.'s resolution.

"From Sunday morning, we will begin activities at Natanz, the site of 3,000-centrifuge machines, and we will drive it with full speed. It will be our immediate response to the resolution," said Ali Larijani, the top nuclear negotiator for Iran.

The U.N. will review the resolution and Iran's activities in 60 days.

Iran to end nuclear cooperation
{{date|January 14, 2006}}
[[Image:LocationIran.png|right|280px|thumb|Map highlighting Iran]]
[[Iran]]ian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] spoke out in a rare news conference on Saturday against statements made by [[Europe]] and the [[United States]], saying that if any country refers it to the [[U.N. Security Council]] over its nuclear program, that it will end their voluntary compliance with surprise inspections and other nuclear cooperation with the [[U.N.]] nuclear watchdog, the [[IAEA]]. He also warned that Europe will lose the chance of reconciliation if it pursues sanctions.

President Ahmadinejad said that even if Iran is referred to the Security Council for possible sanctions, the action would still not stop its nuclear program. "They keep on threatening us that we have to either accept what they say or they will send us to the Security Council," President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said during a news conference in the Iranian capital of {{w|Tehran}}.

Iran's statements came as Europe and the U.S. began to build support for reporting Iran to the U.N. Security Council. However, [[China]] has been cautious and has warned the move could only escalate the confrontation.

Meanwhile, President [[George W. Bush]], and Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], urged U.N. intervention. "The world needs to send a common message to Iran that their behavior...is unacceptable," Bush said.

The U.S. and Europe continue to have growing concerns that Iran is trying to produce nuclear weapons.

On Tuesday, Britain, France and Germany issued a statement declaring that 2 1/2 years of tense negotiations with Tehran were a "dead end" and urged the U.N. Security Council to intervene.
[[Image:UN security council 2005.jpg|left|290px|thumb|The U.N. Security Council]]
Iranian Foreign Minister, Manoucher Mouttaki, said to the press yesterday that "the West will bear the consequences if Iran is sent to the Council. Iran does not need to have permission from any country. It is our legal right to have nuclear energy."

In response the Bush administration, along with Chancellor Angela Merkel, said that they "cannot allow countries such as Iran to blackmail peace-loving countries like themselves."

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that his "country does not need nuclear weapons. They are needed only by people who want to solve everything through the use of force." He then went on to say, "Leaders who believe they can create peace for themselves by creating war for others are mistaken."

Tehran has always said it has the right under Article VI of the {{w|nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty}} &mdash; which the nation has signed but not ratified &mdash; to research nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

Arab League calls for Libyan no-fly zone
{{date|March 12, 2011}}
{{Libya}}
The [[Arab League]] joined calls to impose a {{w|no-fly zone}} over [[Libya]] after a meeting of the 22-nation group in [[Cairo]] on Saturday.

The proposal was settled upon during a six-hour-long emergency meeting at the Arab League's headquarters, with only [[Algeria]] and [[Syria]] in opposition. According to League officials, the group had been in contact with rebels engaged in fighting prior to the meeting.

According to {{w|Amr Moussa}}, the organization's secretary general, it had "officially requested the [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] to impose a no-fly zone against any military action against the Libyan people." Moussa went on to say that he was "talking about a humanitarian action&nbsp;... supporting the Libyan people in their fight for freedom against a regime that is more and more disdainful."

According to onlookers, some members of the League, including Saudi Arabia and Algeria, are concerned about establishing a no-fly zone because they have experienced protests as well, and they worry that uprisings similar to the Libyan one could occur. Additionally, even though the League voted in favor of a no-fly zone, other analysts say internal dissent could lead to them going no further than stating their support.

During the meeting, Libyan protesters gathered outside the headquarters building in support of a no-fly zone. One protester, originally from the Libyan city of [[Benghazi]], said that "[w]e want the Arab League to show the same resolve on this situation as the rest of the world...if they don't, it will be embarrassing for them in front of their own peoples and everyone else."

[[NATO]] considers the support of regional powers essential if a no-fly zone is to be established, as some members believe that it could be seen as outside interference by Western powers. According to [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] Foreign Secretary, [[William Hague]], "You need support within the region from the Arab world" for a no-fly zone and "[the UK] would like Arab nations to participate in it militarily."

US and UK forces join Libyan attack
{{date|March 19, 2011}}
{{Libya}}
After [[France|French]] aircraft began missions over [[Libya]], attacks from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] have begun.

Upwards of 110 {{w|Tomahawk missiles}} have been fired by US and UK warships and submarines in the Mediterranean Sea. Targets include the capitol of [[Tripoli]] and military installations around the country. The attacks have been code-named "Operation Odyssey Dawn."

In addition to French aircraft, [[David Cameron]] said that British aircraft are also taking part in airstrikes. Cameron said that "[[Muammar al-Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] has made this happen. He has lied to the international community. He has promised a ceasefire. He has broken that ceasefire. He continues to brutalise his own people. The time for action has come."

Gaddafi has issued a letter to several international leaders in which he said that "Libya is not yours. Libya is for the Libyans. The [[UN Security Council|security council]] resolution is invalid.  You will regret it if you dare to intervene in our country."

Iran 'suspends' releasing British soldiers; Shots fired near Iranian Consul in Basra, Iraq
{{date|March 29, 2007}}
{{2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel}}

[[Iran]]'s National Security Council has announced that it will "suspend" the releasing of 15 [[United Kingdom|British]] sailors and marines detained by Iranian forces on March 23.

"We had decided to release the lady in the group, but with the political ballyhoo by London, this decision will be for the time- being suspended," said {{w|Iranian National Security Council}} Secretary {{w|Ali Larijani}}.
On Wednesday, Iran had said that at least one soldier, 26 year-old {{w|Faye Turney}}, would "be released very soon."

"British leaders have miscalculated this issue. This case may face a legal path" if we are faced with "fuss, and wrong behavior from Britain," added Larijani.

{{QuoteLeft|We are not seeking to put Iran in a corner. We are simply saying, 'Please release the personnel who should not have been seized in the first place|4=Spokesman for British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]}} Britain says that they will not negotiate the release of their soldiers saying that there will be "no bargaining."

"The important thing for us is to get them back safe and sound, but we can't enter into some basis of bargaining. What you have to do when you are engaged with people like the Iranian regime, you have to keep explaining to them, very patiently, what it is necessary to do and at the same time make them fully aware there are further measures that will be taken if they're not prepared to be reasonable. What you can't do is end up negotiating over hostages; end up saying there's some quid pro quo or tit for tat; that's not acceptable," said [[Tony Blair]], the U.K.'s Prime Minister.

Iran also stated on Iranian state-run radio that if the United Kingdom goes to the [[United Nations Security Council]] or further freezes relations with the nation, they will further delay the release of the soldiers.

According to the Reuters news agency, the United Kingdom is circulating a  15-page draft statement for approval by the U.N. Security Council "deploring" the continuing detention and endorsing UK's stand that the soldiers "were operating in Iraqi waters as part of the Multinational Force-Iraq under a mandate from the Security Council ....and at the request of the government of Iraq. Members of the Security Council support calls for the immediate release of these MNF personnel."

"We are not seeking to put Iran in a corner. We are simply saying, 'Please release the personnel who should not have been seized in the first place," said a spokesperson for British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]].

The sailors and marines from the frigate {{w|HMS Cornwall (F99)|HMS ''Cornwall''}} had been inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1723, a ship that was believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq, though it was subsequently cleared after inspection when Iranian gunboats surrounded the sailors and arrested them at gunpoint.

Shots have been reported to be fired at the Iranian Consul in {{w|Basra, Iraq|Basra}}, [[Iraq]].

The Iranian Consul said that "British soldiers had surrounded [their] office in the southern city and fired shots into the air" calling the incident a "provocative act" and that the incident "could worsen the situation of the British sailors."

Britain stated that the incident did take place but it was a "geographical coincidence" and that no shots were fired into the air.

"A vehicle approached the rear of one of our convoys. A number of rounds were fired. The vehicles returned fire. Nobody dismounted and the vehicle disappeared. There is absolutely no linkage with the location other than geographical coincidence. There was no encirclement and no rounds were fired in the air," said Major David Gell, a spokesman for the British forces in Basra.

No injuries or casualties have been reported.

Iran demands that IAEA end surveillance of its nuclear program
{{date|February 7, 2006}}
[[Image:Flag of IAEA.svg|190px|thumb|Symbol of the IAEA]]
[[image:Flag_of_Iran.svg|right|225px|thumb|Flag of Iran]]
Shortly after ending its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency ([[IAEA]]), the government of [[Iran]] has now ordered the IAEA to discontinue some of its surveillance of Iran's  nuclear facilities. Tehran has also asked the agency to remove any and all signage from their nuclear sites by the end of next week.

This is in response to the Saturday resolution by the IAEA to report Iran to the [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]], which was made without waiting for the director of the IAEA, [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], chairman of the IAEA, to finish preparing a report on {{w|Iran's nuclear program|Iran's civilian}} (and {{w|Iran and weapons of mass destruction|allegedly military}}) nuclear programs for the regular IAEA meeting scheduled for March 6. ElBaradei had given Iran until March to answer IAEA questions. By a vote of 27 to three (with five abstentions), and without the information in ElBaradei's report planned for March 2006, the IAEA recommended that the matter of the Iranian nuclear program be brought before the Security Council.

The recommendation claims that there are serious concerns about Iranian nuclear aims, and the agency does not have confidence that the program is intended solely for civilian or other non-military use. Although the meeting was taken without waiting for ElBaradei's March report, the recommendation requests ElBaradei to make his report anyway, including a list of "steps Iran needs to take to dispel suspicions about its nuclear ambitions" by March 6.

The IAEA's resolution calls for Iran to reinstate a freeze on its nuclear programs, consider ending construction of a plutonium-producing heavy water reactor, and to continue allowing the IAEA's purposes and actions in Iran. However, the council will not implement any further action until ElBaradei makes his full report on March 6.

ElBaradei also reported to the IAEA Monday that Iran would also demand a reduction in the amount of facilities inspections from the agency, and that they would discontinue their agreement to the Additional Protocol of the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty}} (NPT) if the agency reported Iran to the Security Council. This protocol entitles the IAEA to hold unannounced inspections of facilities, increased surveillance capability, and placing IAEA seals on nuclear equipment.

Other diplomatic ventures are being planned. On February 16, Iranian officials will meet with the Russian government in Moscow to discuss the possibility of [[Russia]] enriching uranium for export to Iran in exchange for a halting of its nuclear enrichment program. And Wang Guangya, [[China]]'s ambassador to the UN, said Monday that "Even with the adoption of this IAEA resolution, it is the belief of most of the members there that a diplomatic solution is the way out within the framework of the IAEA."

IAEA suspends nuclear aid for Iran
{{date|March 9, 2007}}
{{Iran nuclear program}}
Governors of the [[United Nations]] nuclear agency [[IAEA]] approved cuts in technical aid to [[Iran]] in accordance with UN sanctions. The move reflected [[UN Security Council]] {{w|Resolution (law)|Resolution}} 17-37 passed last December that bans the transfer of technology or expertise that might aid in producing nuclear fuel. 

The 35-nation board, which is often split over issues on Iran, came to a consensus in ratifying the recommendation of the IAEA's Secretariat to suspend 22 of 55 technical aid programs involving Iran. These consist of four national programs in Iran and 18 regional or trans-regional programs that involve the country. The board did not suspend 33 other programs (11 national and 22 regional) all of which focus on medical and agricultural radio-pharmaceuticals and isotopes. 

The [[United States]] and [[France]] who fund much of the IAEA's special aid programs had originally demanded more sweeping reductions.

Ali Akbar Velayati, international affairs advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] said on Thursday that the IAEA's decision was "politically-motivated". 

Ali-Asghar Soltanieh, Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, said his nation will not stop uranium enrichment activities and that suspended programs are not part of Iran's nuclear enrichment program and the sanctions will have no effect on it. 

He stated "The enrichment program has been indigenous and independent, nobody, even the IAEA, have co-operated or worked with us. Therefore these projects will continue as planned under the supervision of the IAEA." 

Soltanieh declared that the action had been dictated by the U.N. Security Council, and that this was an illegal act undermining the IAEA's professional independence.

IAEA board members joined in supporting IAEA's Director General [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] call for a "double suspension" where both enrichment and sanctions would stop concurrently.

Only North Korea and Saddam Hussein's Iraq have been stripped of nuclear aid because of fear of weapons development.

[[Mohamed el-Baradei]], head of the [[U.N.]] watchdog group [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), may go directly to [[Tehran]] some time this week with a compromise plan to reduce the possibility that [[Iran]] may make use of its uranium enrichment program to produce nuclear arms.

Under a compromise plan negotiated last week between the {{w|EU-3}} (consisting of [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]]) and the [[United States]], a loose agreement was reached where the final stages of nuclear enrichment within Iran, uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas, would be transferred to [[Russia]].

Gholamreza Aghazadeh, who heads the nuclear program in Iran, rejected the proposal on Saturday, insisting that the uranium enrichment program must be carried out in Iran. The rejection came after a meeting with Russian foreign minister of affairs {{w|Igor Ivanov}}. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, {{w|Hamid Reza Assefi}}, denied the meetings were to develop a nuclear program partnership with Russia that specifically relates to the new IAEA proposal.

The IAEA board will meet on November 24, when they may decide to refer Iran for possible economic sanctions before the [[U.N. Security Council]]. The U.S. secretary of state, [[Condoleezza Rice]], has distanced the United States from the short deadline for Iran to conform to the new plan. A state department spokesman, Adam Ereli said on Thursday that, "The secretary does not conduct diplomacy by deadline."

Enriched uranium can be used to generate energy or to make nuclear weapons, a capability Tehran claims is their right to pursue for the peaceful purposes of generating electricity.

Iran resumes nuclear research
{{Iran nuclear program}}
{{date|January 10, 2006}}

[[Iran]] resumed full atomic fuel research today, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] announced, adding that "the research will involve small-scale enrichment of uranium, usable in power plants or weapons."

"There is a difference between research and producing nuclear fuel ... The production of nuclear fuel is still under suspension," said Mohammad Saeedi, deputy head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation.
[[File:LocationIran.png|thumb|left|200px|Location of Iran]]
The [[United States]] has said that any enrichment of uranium would be a "serious escalation." A {{w|Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House}} spokesman also stated that Iran risks referral to the [[UN]]'s [[UN Security Council|Security Council]], which could impose sanctions, if it pursues its current nuclear course.

[[UK|British]] Foreign Secretary {{w|Jack Straw}} said the conflict with Iran would need to be resolved through diplomatic means and that "military action is not on our agenda."

[[Mohamed ElBaradei]], head of the IAEA, told the 35-nation governing board that "Iran intended to carry out limited uranium enrichment at its Natanz facility, where it broke UN seals as IAEA inspectors watched."

"Iran plans to install a small-scale gas ultracentrifuge cascade in its pilot fuel enrichment plant at Natanz," said a Western diplomat, reading from ElBaradei's report.

European diplomats have said that they will hold an emergency IAEA meeting to consider referring {{w|Tehran}} to the UN for further action and or sanctions. The United States said "this now looks inevitable."

Tehran denies wanting nuclear technology for anything but civilian energy programs to satisify the countries "booming" demand for electricity.

Western powers disregard Iran's claim and say that "Iran is to refrain from any work that could help it develop atomic weapons." The EU said Iran's latest action was "eroding international confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear program".

In [[Berlin]], [[Germany|German]] Foreign Minister {{w|Frank-Walter Steinmeier}} warned that by removing the seals of its atomic plants, Tehran had "crossed a line". Steinmeier said "that the Iranians knew they would face consequences as a result of their action". He also added that he hopes Tehran would return to a "path of reason".

Today, [[China]] also urged Tehran to continue talks with the [[European Union|EU]] trio, with foreign ministry spokesman Kong Quan saying "all parties should show restraint and make efforts to build mutual trust".

Iranian news network Khabar reported that the Iranian parliament backed the decision by President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] to resume the research work, terming it a "source of national pride".

The White House said that if Iran continues on its current nuclear course, it will leave the {{w|international community}} no choice but to refer Tehran to the UN Security Council for possible actions.

US ambassador links India's civil nuclear initiative to Iran vote
{{date|January 26, 2006}}
[[image:Bush Singh Ovaloffice july18 2005.jpg|right|300px|thumb|President Bush with India's Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, during their meeting in the Oval Office in July 2005]]
The [[United States]] Ambassador to [[India]], David Mulford, has reportedly hinted that the U.S. civil nuclear energy pact with India may face problems getting approved by Congress if India refused to vote against [[Iran]] at the upcoming meeting of the [[United Nations]] nuclear watchdog committee.

The nuclear pact was made after a July 2005 policy shift by U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] that offered cooperation in India's development of civilian atomic power industry in exchange for its support of the {{w|International Atomic Energy Agency}}'s (IAEA) nonproliferation standards.

The U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stated at a Wednesday briefing that, "The ambassador was expressing his personal opinion about what the potential political outcome might be. He was giving his personal assessment of how the Congress might react to such an action by India." McCormack added that, "We certainly would encourage and hope that they (India) vote for referral this time around."

The IAEA is scheduled to meet February 2 to discuss Iran's referral to the [[U.N. Security Council]] over its resumption of uranium enrichment. The U.S. claims that Iran's nuclear program is aimed at developing weapons, a claim that Tehran denies.

India's foreign ministry rejected any attempt to tie its stance on Iran to the deal with the U.S. on acquiring nuclear know-how.

India has previously supported the IAEA's declaration in September of 2005 that Iran had failed to comply with its international obligations. 

The U.S. also opposes the negotiations, begun in 1994, on a proposed gas pipeline between India and Iran which is intended to provide India with increased energy capacities.

Gbagbo forces reported to have gained ground in Ivorian city of Abidjan
{{date|April 9, 2011}}
{{Ivory Coast}}According to the [[United Nations]], forces loyal to disputed [[Ivory Coast]] president [[Laurent Gbagbo]] have resumed fighting in the city of [[Abidjan]]. According to reports, the troops regained control of parts of the city.

After a brief lull in fighting, while it was reported that Gbagbo officials were negotiating a surrender, violence resumed. A U.N. official said that Gbagbo forces "clearly used the lull of Tuesday as a trick to reinforce their position," and now control the Plateau and Cocody regions of Abidjan.

Gbagbo forces are reportedly using heavy weaponry, including {{w|rocket launchers|rocket launchers}} and grenade launchers, as well as tanks and armored troop transports. The [[France|French]] ambassador's house was reportedly attacked, resulting in counter-strikes by French helicopters. Gbagbo forces deny being involved in the attack.

Toussaint Alain, an advisor to Gbagbo, has denied reports that Gbagbo forces are in possession of heavy weapons, claiming that previous French attacks had destroyed their weaponry. He said that "France is just looking for a pretext to get rid of President Laurent Gbagbo."

Iran promises retaliation for Israeli action against nuclear facilities
{{date|January 25, 2006}}
[[image:Flag_of_Iran.svg|right|225px|thumb|Flag of Iran]]
[[Iran]] is referencing the conditions of the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)}}, as justification for defending what it believes is its right under Article IV of the NPT to have nuclear technology and hold on to its developing nuclear program, despite great pressure from the West and others to abandon certain nuclear technological capabilities. Article IV defines ''...the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I and II of this Treaty.''

The ''Associated Press'' reported today that Tehran is planning a retaliation contingency against [[Israel]] should the country go forward with a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities in early March, as Ariel Sharon said may occur, before he suffered a debilitating stroke in December 2005.

General Mostafa Mohammad Najjar, Iran's minister of defense, articulated Teheran's position on any military action against Iran's nuclear capability, saying that "Zionists should know that if they do anything evil against Iran, the response of Iran's armed forces will be so firm that it will send them into eternal coma, like (Ariel) Sharon". He also proceeded to question the resolve of the United States and Israel to attack Iran on the grounds of violating international conventions concerning nuclear energy.

The [[United States]] government says that it wants Iran to comply by discontinuing uranium enrichment in its facilities, and said Iran will be sent to the [[United Nations Security Council]] (UNSC) over this dispute if Tehran maintains its refusal to comply with the international community

Both sides are clearly determined in their position, which leads to an interesting development of [[Mohamed ElBaradei|Mohammad elBaradei]], the head of the {{w|International Atomic Energy Agency}} (IAEA), saying that the US and other nuclear powers should themselves disarm as well if they don't want to be hypocrites, ''ArabicNews.com'' reports. Article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty states that: ''Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.'' The United States has signed the NPT, but Israel has not.

Another development which may foment further controversy also came Wednesday when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed the United States for a series of bombings in Ahvaz, a town near the border of Iraq, which left at least nine civilians dead. "Traces of the occupiers of Iraq is evident in the Ahvaz events. They should take responsibility in this regard," Ahmadinejad remarked to Iranian state television stations today.

Mohamed ElBaradei: Highly enriched uranium found in Iran is "of little significance"
{{date|May 14, 2006}}

[[Image:Iran_nuclear_illustration.png|right|200px]]
Back in 2003, inspectors had discovered several sites in Iran that tested positive for highly enriched uranium, but the uranium was believed to have come from equipment that was previously from [[Pakistan]].

On Friday, [[Reuters]] published a report quoting [[UN]] diplomats from Vienna who wish to remain anonymous alleging that preliminary analysis of microscopic dust collected from equipment at the now razed {{w|Lavizan-Shiyan}} research center in [[Iran]] in January of 2005, contained traces of "highly enriched {{w|uranium}}".  "It's no smoking gun. There could be many explanations. But it increases pressure on Iran to come clean about Lavizan," Reuters reported the European diplomat as stating.

According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the [[IAEA]], said today that the finding of the highly enriched uranium is "of little significance at the current juncture."  ElBaradei also pointed out that the investigation into where it came from is continuing and that the uranium could have come from equipment that was imported to Iran, but that "time is still needed to reach a conclusion in this respect."

ElBaradei also highlighted that he is aware of the right for Iran to use nuclear material for "peaceful purposes" and that "a balance between Iran's nuclear rights and concerns of the international community would not be created through verbal disputes, but rather dialogue would be the solution."

Speaking on Friday about the allegation, former UN weapons inspector and former head of the Institute for Science and International Security, David Albright said, "even if it is the same contamination, this is a significant finding because it indicates something was going on at Lavizan. It could be part of Iran's known centrifuge program or a parallel program."

In response, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi asserted, "these comments lack any importance and do not come from a real source."  Denying that his country had carried out any work at the Lavizan-Shiyan facility, Asefi added that the UN claims were "baseless and without importance."

On Friday Iran's President, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] responded to the UN allegations saying, "they are trying to frighten our country by waging a propaganda campaign using strong words. The people of Iran and the country are not afraid of them" and that "this whole thing is just psychological propaganda, but they know the Islamic republic nation of Iran is a strong nation. I think they have better sense than to have a war with Iran. Every country has the right to defend its right in accordance with the agreed way."

Iran started to enrich uranium at its Natanz nuclear facility April 11, and continues to claim its program is for peaceful purposes.

Israel to build new settlements in West Bank
{{date|March 13, 2011}}
{{Israel}}
[[Israel]] announced Sunday that it plans to build several hundred new housing facilities in the occupied {{w|West Bank}}, days after several Israelis were {{w|Itamar attack|killed}} in an attack on Friday.

According to officials, a meeting on Saturday of a government committee resulted in the decision to build up to 500 new housing units, all within existing settlements.  The new buildings are to be constructed in areas that Israel expects to retain control of in the event of any potential peace accord with [[Palestine]].

A Palestinian spokesperson said that Israel's decision was "wrong and unacceptable and will only create problems." The building of settlements by Israel is widely criticized; in February fourteen of the fifteen [[United Nations Security Council]] members, with the [[US]] the only exception, supported a resolution that would demand Israel stop further construction.

The announcement of the new buildings came days after five Israelis were stabbed to death on Friday night, in an attack suspected to be of Palestinian origin. In response to the attack, residents of the area had asked the Israeli government to build new housing facilities. 

The attacks were referenced by Prime Minister {{w|Benjamin Netanyahu}}, who said in a statement that he had "noticed that several countries that always hasten to the U.N. Security Council in order to condemn Israel, the state of the Jews, for planning a house in some locality, or for laying some tiles somewhere, have been dilatory in sharply condemning the murder of Jewish infants."

Red Cross ambulances hit by Israeli strike
{{2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
{{date|July 26, 2006}}

Six ambulance workers and their patients were wounded when [[Israel|Israeli]] missiles struck {{w|International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross}} ambulances on a rescue mission in south [[Lebanon]]. The attack took place near Qana when an ambulance from {{w|Tyre}} arrived intending to evacuate three patients from the border town of Tibnin. Two ambulances were completely destroyed as their roofs were pierced by missiles. According to one of the drivers, two guided missiles were fired at each ambulance. It is claimed that the ambulance headlamps were on, the blue light overhead was flashing, and another light illuminated the Red Cross flag at the time. 

The patients, the Fawaz family, all had minor injuries before the missiles struck the ambulance. Now the son is losing his leg and the other is treated for shrapnel wounds.  

The Lebanese Red Cross demanded that Israel guarantee their safety through the [[United Nations]] or the International Red Cross or they would cease all rescue missions. The South Lebanon ambulance service is run entirely by volunteers. This means that 100,000 people of the Tyre district, villages below the Litani river, would have no ambulance transport to reach hospital. 

Red Cross volunteer Mr Shaalan says although this is the first time ambulances have been hit by Israel in this war, it was only a matter of time. A lorry from the {{w|United Arab Emirates}} carrying medical supplies was hit in eastern Lebanon last week killing its driver and injured six Lebanese Red Cross workers. Yesterday afternoon the Red Cross office in Tyre trembled when two missiles landed in the building across the road.

An {{w|The Australian|''Australian''}} correspondent reports from the city of {{w|Tyre}} that at least 10 Lebanese ambulances bearing the International Red Cross emblem have been targeted in Israeli air strikes in the south of Lebanon that have killed more than a dozen civilian passengers on transport to hospitals. 

An Israeli army spokesman said, “The incident in which vehicles were hit last night occurred in an area known to be one of the main sources of the launching of hundreds of missiles.” 
 
The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement said it had set up two southern bases, in the port of Tyre and the town of Marjayoun further east.

Iran stands defiant on Uranium enrichment
{{date|May 21, 2006}}

[[Iran]] has rejected [[European Union]] incentives to give up its {{w|uranium}} enrichment program. Foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that any plan has to acknowledge Iran's legal rights under {{w|international law}}, including Article IV of the [[s:Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)]].

It is believed that [[UK|Britain]], [[France]], and [[Germany]], all member states of the EU, are developing incentives for Iran to give up its enrichment programming in an attempt to defuse mutual fears and perceptions of threats by [[US]], [[Israel]]i, and Iranian governments. The incentives are believed to include a raft of security, trade and technology benefits.

The proposal by the three EU members encourages other nations to support the construction of {{w|Light water reactor|light water power generation reactors}}, to set up a nuclear fuel bank and the relaxation of [[United States]] trade restrictions to allow Iran to purchase commercial planes built in the US. These incentives are conditional upon Iran renouncing its rights under Article IV of the NPT, i.e. stopping its Uranium enrichment program, and cooperating with the [[United Nations]] [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) in ways additional to its present cooperation, which at present includes continuous monitoring of many key Iranian nuclear facilities by the IAEA.

If Iran doesn't comply, Britain, France and Germany will support economic sanctions against Iran, the refusal to issue visas to Iranian officials and a freeze on the assets belonging to individuals and corporations with ties to the Iranian regime.

Mr Asefi said he would not comment on the proposal at this stage. He said it would be "hasty to comment on a raw proposal that has been brought up in the media, and still neither officially nor unofficially given to us."

Mr Asefi said that any plan would have to recognise Iran's rights to be considered. "The basis of our work is that the Islamic Republic of Iran's rights must be recognised in any plan," he said.

"We cannot retreat. The proposal should provide ways to secure our rights," he said. "We will not stop enrichment."

Mr. Asefi warned Europe against economic sanctions saying that they would harm Europe. "We have broad trade and economic ties with European and non-European countries. These ties can be damaged and this damage will harm European countries even more." he said.

Iran announces its building of a second nuclear power plant
{{date|September 25, 2009}}

{{Iran}}The [[Iran|Iran]]ian government has announced that the nation is near completion of a second nuclear power facility. The announcement was made in a September 21 letter from the Iranian government to the [[United Nations Security Council]] that a second nuclear plant was being constructed in the city of {{w|Qom}}.

In the letter to the [[U.N.]], the Iranian government states that the plant will contain 3,000 {{w|Nuclear fuel cycle|centrifuges}} and produce roughly 5% {{w|uranium}}. 

According to {{w|CNN}}, the Iranian government made the announcement after the nation received word that the [[United States]] had already known about the facility. CNN cites an unnamed U.S. government official as saying the U.S. was made aware of the facility at some point during the presidency of [[George W. Bush]]. Today the U.S., along with [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], condemned the new plant.

"Iran's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the non-proliferation regime.  The size and configuration of this facility is inconsistent with a peaceful program," said U.S. president [[Barack Obama]] during a press conference.  French president {{w|Nicolas Sarkozy}} and Prime Minister of the UK {{w|Gordon Brown}} stood next to Obama as he made the statement.

The Iranian government has repeatedly stated that their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and for the production of electricity.  In response, the country's President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] said that the new plant was not a secret and that the {{w|International Atomic Energy Agency}} knew the plant existed.  He also called the statements made by Obama, Brown, and Sarkozy a "mistake."

"It's not a secret site. If it was, why would we have informed the IAEA about it a year ahead of time. They (U.S., UK & France) will regret this announcement. If I were Obama's adviser, I would definitely advise him to refrain from making this statement because it is definitely a mistake. It would definitely be a mistake," said Ahmadinejad to reporters in {{w|New York, New York|New York City}} in the U.S.

The U.N. Security Council has passed several resolutions ordering Iran to stop its enrichment of uranium, or face sanctions. The first resolution, {{w|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1696|1696}}, passed the council in July of 2006 with 14 nations agreeing to the resolution and one opposing it. The resolution ordered Iran to stop enrichment and in December 2006, the council unanimously voted on {{w|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737|1737}}, which enacted sanctions banning the supply of nuclear related materials to the country, and froze assets of individuals and companies connected to the country's nuclear program.

France, Italy, UK sending military advisers to Libya; photojournalists killed in Misrata
{{Libya}}
{{date|April 21, 2011}}
[[File:3843 -  La Russa, Ignazio - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 9-July-2007.jpg|thumb|left|La Russa in 2007. {{image  credit|[[commons:User:G.dallorto|G.dallorto]]}}]]

[[France]] and [[Italy]] have announced along with the [[United Kingdom]] that they will be sending military advisers to help [[Libya]]n rebels in their fight against the forces of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]].

Italian Minister for Defence {{w|Ignazio La Russa}} said Wednesday that his country will send ten instructors. French officials said they would send fewer than ten. The British Foreign Secretary, [[William Hague]], said they would send a team that could possibly contain up to twenty advisers.

La Russa said in a news conference that the advisers' roles had yet to be determined, "They won't be on the battlefield. They'll be mentors, they won't accompany them. Training is one thing, participation another." 

He further said of the rebels, "They're rich in enthusiasm, they want to fight for liberty, but naturally they are poor in experience and arms." However, La Russa believes that not all the arms the rebels have were taken from the {{w|Libyan Army}} stockpiles, stating, "I don't think they only have arms from the Gaddafi army. Some help arrived." He did not elaborate on the final statement.      

Meanwhile, [[United States|U.S.]] officials say President [[Barack Obama]]'s administration plans to give the Libyan opposition {{w|USD|$}}25 million in non-lethal assistance. The officials say the assistance could include items such as vehicles, fuel trucks, protective vests and non-secure radios.

{{missing image|File:Libya Brega rebel fighters 10 March 2011 - VOA Ittner.jpg|thumb|left|Libyan rebels on the outskirts of Brega on March 10, 2011. {{Image source|VOA - Phil Ittner}}|itsdeadjim=x}}
Libya's foreign minister, {{w|Abdul Ati al-Obeidi}}, criticized the dispatch of foreign military advisers, saying it will harm chances for peace in the  country.  In an interview with the BBC, Obeidi called for a ceasefire  followed by a six month period to prepare for an election. "We think any military presence is a step backwards, and we are sure that if this bombing stopped and there is a real ceasefire we could have a dialogue among all Libyans about what they  want — democracy, political reform, constitution, election. This could not be done with what is going on now," said Obeidi.

The move comes as [[United Nations|UN]] officials condemn the use of {{w|cluster bombs}} that are in use by pro-Gaddaffi forces, a tactic banned under the {{w|Convention on Cluster Munitions}}, of which Libya is not a signatory. 

{{w|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights}} {{w|Navi Pillay}} stated, amidst reports of snipers attacking civilians in many towns, that use of such munitions would "inevitably lead to civilian casualties", whilst also calling for [[NATO]] forces to "exercise the utmost caution and vigilance so as not to kill civilians by mistake". Pillay praised the Libyan government for allowing on Monday a U.N. humanitarian base in the capital city of [[Tripoli]].

Meanwhile, fighting has continued between rebel and pro-government forces this Wednesday in the besieged western port city of {{w|Misrata}}, where residents are pleading for international intervention. 

British photojournalist {{w|Tim Hetherington}}, who co-directed the documentary film ''{{w|Restrepo}}'', which was nominated for an {{w|Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature}} this year, died from wounds he suffered in an {{w|Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG}} attack in the city. 

{{QuoteRight|In besieged Libyan city of Misrata. Indiscriminate shelling by Qaddafi forces. No sign of NATO.|source=Tim Hetherington's last tweet}}
His colleagues, photographers {{w|Chris Hondros}} and Guy Martin were also severely wounded. Hondros suffered a severe brain injury leaving him in a critical condition and eventually succumbed to his injury at a triage center and Martin, a British citizen, was injured by shrapnel, and is now receiving [[wikt:vascular|vascular]] surgery. Another with the group, Michael Christopher Brown also received shrapnel wounds which were not life-threatening. 

Hetherington last updated his [[Twitter]] account on Tuesday, which read, "In besieged Libyan city of Misrata. Indiscriminate shelling by Qaddafi forces. No sign of NATO."

Leaders in the rebel-held city called  for the urgent intervention of foreign ground troops to protect the  500,000 civilians there, the first  such request by anyone among Libya's  opposition forces. The rebels' civilian leadership, the Transitional National Council, has however rejected the presence of foreign troops on Libyan soil to help  their cause.

Meanwhile, across the country, NATO airstrikes again struck government installations in several cities.

A vocational nurse working for Dr. John Capriotti, a plastic surgeon, was accused of setting the fire that wounded several and killed three people in Houston, Texas on March 28.  She was allegedly trying to cover up the fact that she hadn't completed the paperwork for an upcoming audit.

The fire began in Dr. Capriotti's office on the fifth floor and quickly spread to the sixth.  Arson investigators from the Houston Fire Department, the FBI and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had been working to determine the source of the fire.

World leaders react to death of Osama bin Laden
{{date|May 3, 2011}}
{{Al-Qaeda}}
{{QuoteLeft|Osama bin Laden suggested that he was operating in the name of Islam, but in reality he makes a mockery of the fundamental values of his own and every other religion.|source=[[Angela Merkel]]}}
Leaders and officals around the world have issued varied reactions to the announcement that [[Osama bin Laden]] has been killed during a [[U.S.]] military operation in [[Pakistan]]. [[NATO]] has insisted it will continue fighting against militants in [[Afghanistan]], and the [[United Nations]] said the death of bin Laden marked a "watershed moment in our common global fight against terrorism."

Announcing that the [[al-Qaeda]] leader had been killed by U.S. special forces during a forty-minute raid on a compound in {{w|Abbottabad}}, near the capital [[Islamabad]], U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] said it was "a good day for America." Speaking at a ceremony to celebrate winners of the {{w|Medal of Honor}}, Obama praised the "anonymous heroes" who took part in the operation. He said: "We may not always know their names, we may not always know their stories, but they are always there on the front lines of freedom and we are truly blessed. As commander-in-chief, I could not be prouder of our men and women in uniform." 

{{w|Anders Fogh Rasmussen}}, the chief of NATO, vowed the organization would remain fighting in Afghanistan despite the death of bin Laden. "As terrorism continues to pose a direct threat to our security and international stability, international cooperation remains key and NATO is at the heart of that cooperation," he said in a statement. "NATO allies and partners will continue their mission to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for extremism, but develops in peace and security." 

The U.N. and the {{w|European Parliament}} also welcomed the news. [[Ban Ki-moon]], the U.N. secretary general, said: "The death of Osama bin Laden, announced by President Obama last night, is a watershed moment in our common global fight against terrorism. The crimes of al-Qaeda touched most continents, bringing tragedy and loss of life to thousands of men, women and children."

[[File:Barack Obama annoucing Osama mission crop.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Barack Obama]] announces the news that bin Laden had been killed. He said it was "a good day for America." {{image|{{w|White House}}}}]]
[[David Cameron]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] Prime Minister, said the news "will be welcomed right across our country" and was a "massive step forward," but warned the death of bin Laden "does not mark the end of the threat we face from extremist terror." [[Italy|Italian]] Prime Minster [[Silvio Berlusconi]] said: "This is a great outcome in the fight against evil, in the fight against terrorism, a great outcome for the United States and for all democracies".

[[Angela Merkel]], the [[Germany|German]] chancellor, said the killing of bin Laden was a "decisive strike" at al-Qaeda. "At his command and in his name, terror was enforced into many countries against men women and children, Christians as well as Muslims," she said. "Osama bin Laden suggested that he was operating in the name of Islam, but in reality he makes a mockery of the fundamental values of his own and every other religion."

Several Asian countries also said bin Laden's death was a step forward in the war against terrorism. [[China|Chinese]] spokeswoman {{w|Jiang Yu}} said "China has taken note of the announcement. We believe the death of Osama bin Laden is a milestone and a positive development for the international anti-terrorism efforts." [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] also welcomed the news.

[[Australia]] pledged not to withdraw forces from Afghanistan after the announcement. "Osama bin Laden declared war on innocent people and today he has paid the price for that declaration," [[Julia Gillard]], the Prime Minister, said. "The mission in Afghanistan will continue," she added, saying al-Qaeda "will continue". [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the President of [[France]], said bin Laden was a "promoter of the ideology of hatred and was the chief of a terrorist organization responsible for the deaths of thousands of victims, especially in Muslim countries," and "justice has been done" for the victims of al-Qaeda attacks.

Gaddafi loyalists allegedly using Red Cross helicopters to bomb rebel held city
{{date|May 8, 2011}}
{{Libya}}
[[File:Flag of the Red Cross.svg|left|thumb|The official flag of the Red Cross {{image credit|Jon Harald Soby}}]]

Forces loyal to besieged [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] have entered into the rebel stronghold of [[Misrata]], [[Libya]], in helicopters bearing [[Red Cross]] markings to drop naval bombs on the port city, continuing a two-month long attack. Gaddafi forces are attempting to cut off humanitarian aid that the rebels are receiving, which primarily comes from ships which dock in Misrata's port from humanitarian organisations. 

The helicopters reportedly flew over Misrata, the third largest city in the country and located on the northwest coast of Libya, on Thursday and Friday, disguised as aid workers from the Red Cross to circumvent the {{w|2011 military intervention in Libya|no-fly zone}}, which was approved unanimously by the [[U.N. Security Council]] in March. The no-fly zone aims at making it impossible for Gaddafi loyalists to perform airstrikes on the rebels.  

[[NATO]], who is aiding the rebels in striking Gaddafi strongholds, stated that helicopters had been spotted flying over Misrata on Thursday, but could not confirm that the helicopters bore the Red Cross logo. A spokesperson did, however, confirm that no humanitarian missions had been scheduled to fly that day. A rebel spokesman told {{w|CNN}} that helicopters flying over the city on Saturday had Red Cross markings. The same day, Gaddafi's troops were able to destroy six major fuel tanks in the city.  
 
The latest incidents come after [[Italy]] confirmed it has not and will not supply the rebels with weapons to use against Gaddafi and his forces, but will consider sending non-lethal weapons such as radars and satellites. However, the rebel {{w|National Transitional Council}} said opposition representatives were flying to Italy to sign a deal that would see Italy send arms to rebel forces.

Four U.N. staff dead after plane crash in Bolivia
{{date|May 10, 2011}}
{{Bolivia}}[[File:Los Yungas La Paz - Bolivia.jpg|thumb|left|{{w|Los Yungas}} is the largest producer of coca in [[Bolivia]]. {{image|Elias Bizannes}}]]
Six people, including four [[U.N.]] staff working for the anti-narcotics department in [[Bolivia]], have been killed in a plane crash in a remote area in the west of the country.

Two {{w|Bolivian military}} pilots are also among those killed in the accident, which happened in the {{w|Los Yungas}} area, northeast of the capital city, {{w|La Paz}}. The aircraft had been missing since Thursday and was found on Saturday morning according to a general in the {{w|Bolivian Air Force}}, who added the light {{w|Cessna}} aircraft hit a tall tree and then impacted the ground. 

Robert Brockmann, a U.N. spokesperson in Bolivia, said the aircraft "was completely destroyed and burned." Investigators have not yet determined what caused the accident, but Brockmann said the aircraft was in an area with overgrown trees and steep cliffs. 

The bodies of the pilots and U.N. personnel, who had been monitoring the transport of {{w|coca}}&mdash;a plant used to make {{w|cocaine}}&mdash;over several months, have yet to be recovered because of the remote location of the crash site. "The place is completly inaccessible in a very tall forest," the general said.

Iran determined to continue with nuclear program
{{Iran nuclear program}}
{{date|September 18, 2005}}

The President of [[Iran]], [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], announced Saturday the resolve of his country to proceed with the development of {{w|nuclear energy}}. He stated that Iran would not pursue {{w|nuclear weapons}}.

Mr. Ahmadinejad also noted that he was willing to allow international inspection of his program, and reaffirmed his claim of its peaceful nature.

At the [[United Nations|UN]] conference,  Mr. Ahmadinejad made clear that he felt that Iran had a right to nuclear energy, and that the nations of world practiced "nuclear apartheid" by refusing to let Iran pursue this course. "We're not going to cave in to the excessive demands of certain powers," he said, refusing to yield to international pressure to halt his country's nuclear course.

He said that talks should be restarted, this time including other nations such as [[South Africa]].

The speech was not in line with what the [[United States|US]] and others want for Iran; {{w|United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State}} [[Condoleezza Rice]] warned the UN that Iran's nuclear ambitions were dangerous. One British official was quoted as saying "This was an unhelpful speech on which we will now want to consult our partners on the International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors."

The [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] is slated to begin a discussion on Iran's nuclear program in {{w|Vienna}} on Monday.

Iran moves finances out of Europe's banks
{{date|January 20, 2006}}
[[Image:LocationIran.png|right|200px|thumb|Map highlighting Iran.]]
[[Iran]], has decided to pull its finances out of [[Europe]]an banks and into different foreign banks. A senior Iranian official stated that this is an attempt to pre-empt possible [[U.N.]] sanctions over its resumption of nuclear fuel enrichment activities. 

Comments by Iran's central bank governor Ebrahim Sheibani, carried on air by the ISNA student news agency, confirmed that Iran had started transferring funds.

"We transfer foreign reserves to wherever we see as expedient. On this issue, we have started transferring. We are doing that," Sheibani told the ISNA agency.

Ebrahim Sheibani also told the agency that the assets were being moved to an "undisclosed" location.

It is unknown exactly how much money is involved or whether or not Iran's investments in Europe would be affected by the move. Traders have said that they had already factored such a  possibility into the market.

Gary Samore, an expert on Iran and vice president for international programs at the McArthur Foundation in [[Chicago]], said "the move reflected concern by Tehran that the Europeans might take unilateral measures amid the crisis over its nuclear program." He also added that its decision to pull its assets from Europe "makes sense in terms of preparing for the possibility that Europe might take some measure to impose some financial sanctions. I don't know that it changes the diplomatic formula. The key issue is still the question of whether or not the Western group can engineer a formal referral to the [[UN Security Council|Security Council]]."

It is unclear if an asset freeze or other punishment is imminent in Iran, but it has happened before. The country's assets in the [[United States]] have been frozen since Iranians seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its staff hostage after the 1979 Islamic revolution.

An [[Italy|Italian]] court last year had ordered an Iranian bank account to be frozen at the request of U.S. plaintiffs who were seeking compensation for terrorist acts they believe were supported by the country (Iran).

Earlier the EU drafted a resolution that calls for referring Iran to the 15-nation council. But it is said to stop short of asking for punitive measures against Iran. The [[IAEA]] is expected to meet on February 2, 2006 to discuss Europe's draft.

France says Iran's nuclear program is a "military cover"
{{date|February 16, 2006}}

Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy of [[France]] went on French TV and accused [[Iran]] of having a "clandestine" nuclear program saying, "no civilian nuclear program can explain the Iranian nuclear program. So it is a clandestine Iranian military nuclear program. The international community has sent a very firm message by saying to the Iranians: 'Come back to reason. Suspend all nuclear activity and the enrichment of uranium and the conversion of uranium', but they are not listening to us. That is the reason why, for the first time for days, the international community is united. It's not just the Europeans -- France, [[Germany]] and the [[UK|British]], it's also [[Russia]] and [[China]]."

However, on a French radio station the Iranian chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani said, "contrary to all the propaganda against us, we are not seeking a nuclear bomb, since we are a signatory to (the nuclear) {{w|Non-Proliferation Treaty|(NPT)}}. We are a responsible country - it is Western propaganda that keeps on saying that Iran is seeking a bomb, but it is not true. We want to be in this camp of countries that have nuclear energy technology but no nuclear weapons, such as [[Brazil]] and [[Japan]]" 

China has expressed concern. Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang has said that [[Beijing]] wants a "peaceful solution by diplomatic means."

Iran resumed small-scale {{w|uranium enrichment}} on Tuesday, after the [[IAEA]] reported it to the [[UN Security Council]]. Iran had stopped the enrichment process nearly 2 1/2 years ago.
{{wikipediapars|the [[w:Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]]}}
"Now it's up to the Security Council to say what it will do, what means it will use to stop, to manage, to halt this terrible crisis of nuclear proliferation caused by Iran," added Douste-Blazy. During discussion of the crisis of nuclear proliferation less than one year earlier, in the month-long 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, several representatives of non-aligned states complained about the violation of Article VI of the NPT by the official nuclear weapons states, including France, who allegedly have not yet made significant moves towards nuclear disarmament as required under Article VI, and about nuclear proliferation to previously non-nuclear weapons states, such as Germany, under ''{{w|nuclear sharing}}'' arrangements.

US criticizes Iran for remarks at nuclear conference
{{date|May 4, 2010}}{{Politics and conflicts}}[[United States]] Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] has warned that [[Iran]]'s nuclear program is a threat to the world, shortly after Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] accused countries with nuclear capabilities of threatening those who were developing civilian nuclear technology.

The remarks by both came at a conference on the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty}} in [[New York]].  Ahmadinejad had criticized western nations, as well as [[Israel]], in his speech, which prompted delegations from the US, [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]] to walk out.  American officials said that Ahmadinejad's remarks were indicative of Iran's increased isolation by the international community.

Ahmadinejad had also been critical of nations with nuclear weapons for failing to disarm, saying that "production, stockpiling and qualitative improvement of nuclear armaments... now serves as a justification for the others to develop their own" and nuclear weapons were "a fire against humanity, rather than a weapon of defence. The possession of nuclear bombs is not a source of pride. Its possession is disgusting and shameful."

US White House spokesman {{w|Robert Gibbs}} said that it was "predictable" that Iran was continuing its silence on the treaty itself, which would see all signatories relinquish any access to nuclear weapons, through either disarmament or a pledge not to develop nuclear weapons.  He also said that Iran was making "wild accusations" about the treaty, the guidelines of which which it has so far failed to follow.  Iran continues to claim its nuclear program is for civilian purposes exclusively.

Clinton said in her speech that "Iran will do whatever it can to divert attention away from its own record in an attempt to evade accountability" and that "[Iran] has defied the [[UN]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]] and the [[IAEA]] and placed the future of the non-proliferation regime in jeopardy, and that is why it is facing increasing isolation and pressure from the international community."

Turkish teenager dies from bird flu
{{Avian Flu infobox}}
{{date|January 5, 2006}}

A 14 year old Turkish male has died from [[avian influenza|bird flu]] in [[Turkey]]. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), it is most likely the teenager died from the deadly {{w|H5N1}} strain of the virus.

The teenager's sister has also been infected with another sibling also suspected to have the virus. Eight other people, mostly from the same family have been hospitalized in the city of Van, Turkey with flu-like symptoms.

The children were from Dogu Beyazit, a farming town in eastern Turkey. It is believed that the children raised poultry on a small farm and may have been in contact with sick birds. The family also ate diseased poultry.

The young male was originally thought to have died from a {{w|pnuemonia}} related infection. Later tests revealed that the male had in fact died from bird flu.

According to Huseyin Avni Sahin, the head doctor of the hospital in Van where the teenager was treated, "(The boy) died of the H5N1 strain of bird flu". Turkish Health Minister Recep Akdag gave no specific details and said samples had been sent to the WHO and Britain for more tests.

If the teenager is confirmed to have had H5N1, it would be the first death from H5N1 in [[Europe]].

Huseyin Avni Sahin has requested more ventilators to treat the ill people.

While H5N1 remains difficult for humans to contract, authorities fear it may mutate into a form that is passable among humans. Such a mutation could kill millions of people around the globe.

UN accuses Australia of 'demonising asylum seekers'
{{date|May 27, 2011}}   
{{Australia}}
[[File:Navanethem_Pillay.jpg|thumb|left|180px|File photo of Navi Pillay in 2009 {{image credit|Antônio Cruz (Agência Brasil)}}]]
The [[United Nations]] Human Rights Commissioner has questioned [[Australia]]'s tough asylum seeker policies this week, stating that Australia's mandatory detention regime has "cast a shadow" over its human rights record. {{W|Navi Pillay}}, the UN's Human Rights watchdog, was particularly critical of Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]]'s asylum seeker trade deal with [[Malaysia]].

This bilateral agreement, if signed, would see 800 refugees attempting to get to Australia by boat immediately transported to Malaysia instead. In return, Australia would take 4,000 genuine refugees from Malaysia over a space of four years. However, Malaysia has not signed either the international Refugee Convention, or the Convention Against Torture.   In an interview with the ABC, Ms Pillay voiced concern over this, stating that Australia may "violate refugee law" by sending asylum seekers to a country where no laws are in place to protect them.

Pillay, a South African former anti-apartheid protester, also voiced distress over the omnipresence of political "demonising" of these asylum seekers stating, "[t]he consequence of the constant political refrain that Australia is being 'flooded' by people who are 'queue jumpers' has resulted in a stigmatisation of an entire group of people, irrespective of where they have come from or what dangers they have fled".

In her six-day trip to Australia, the UN Human Rights Commissioner visited two detention centres and said she was overwhelmed with the "grim despondency" of asylum seekers, many of whom wait over 18 months to have their case assessed.

The mistreatment of refugees was today reinforced with the release of an Australian Rights Commission report, which revealed extensive problems of self-harm and depression among detainees at the Villawood Detention Centre in [[Sydney]].

Afghan opium plantings expected to be up 40% from 2005
{{date|March 15, 2006}}
[[File:8651819 d63dee249d o.jpg|thumb|180px|Opium seized in Afghanistan]]
In spite of the [[U.S.]] Government's "five pillar counternarcotics strategy" for combating narcotics in [[Afghanistan]], approximately 140,000 hectares of poppies were planted in Afghanistan this year, according to the [[Associated Press]]. This would be an increase of about 40 percent from 2005. The [[United Nations]] Office on Drugs and Crime's Rapid Assessment Survey released last month indicates that poppy planting for 2006 increased in 13 provinces, decreased in only three and remained stable in 15.

Afghan government officials are asking the drug lords to invest their illegally earned profits in Afghanistan, according to Helmand Gov. Mohammed Daud, the governor of the biggest opium-growing region. 

During a trip to the region by U.S. Ambassador Ronald Neumann, Daud said; "We as a government will provide them the opportunity to use their money for the national benefit."

The narcotics trade currently accounts for 35 per cent of Afghanistan's income.
Doug Wankel, a former Drug Enforcement Administration official who is point man for the U.S. counternarcotics initiative at the American Embassy in Kabul, says the opium industry is "financing terrorism. It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism. ... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."

The USA's "five pillar strategy" includes public information, alternative livelihoods, eradication, interdiction, and law enforcement/justice reform.

Iran to abandon Nuclear Non Proliferation (NPT) if threatened to cut down on nuclear activities
{{date|February 11, 2006}}
Coming on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] has said that if forced to limit its nuclear activities, [[Iran]] will altogether abandon the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT}}. 

Ahmad said that the nuclear program is a peaceful pursuit to better "industry, medicine and economy".
Addressing large crowds in {{w|Tehran}}, he attacked the notion of a referral to the [[United Nations Security Council]], and the perceived bullying by the board of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].
He further warned, in reference to Article IV of the NPT which allows for civilian development of nuclear energy, in exchange for nuclear weapons states disarming (Article VI), that "On the other hand, if we are seeing that in total disregard for our following these rules and regulations that you still push to impose on Iranian rights- understand that it will not be tolerated and that the nation of Iran will reconsider its policies".

Although the vast majority of sovereign states (187) are ''party'' to the NPT, Iran would join the small minority of states that are not party to the NPT. {{w|North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea}} withdrew from the NPT on January 10, 2003. {{w|India and weapons of mass destruction|India}}, {{w|Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan}}, and {{w|Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Israel}} are not parties to the NPT. 

Having previously reiterated in 2004 that it would not leave the NPT, Iran performed a u-turn on its position towards treaty signatories, first showing signs during September 2005 when Iran's top nuclear negotiator that it would quit the NPT when {{w|Ali Larijani}} warned that Tehran could quit the NPT if brought before the [[United Nations Security Council|UNSC]].

NATO deploys helicopters in Libya
{{date|June 7, 2011}}
{{Libya}}
The [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] have begun helicopter attacks against Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s military forces in [[Libya]], as part of the [[NATO]] campaign to protect civilians. The {{W|Apache}} helicopters were launched from the [[UK|British]] ship HMS ''Ocean'' and the [[France|French]] assault ship ''Tonnerre'', and attacked a radar installation and a military checkpoint near {{w|Brega}}. Whilst in a separate mission, helicopters destroyed two ammunition bunkers in central Libya.

"The use of attack helicopters provides the NATO operation with additional flexibility to track and engage pro-Gadhafi forces who deliberately target civilians and attempt to hide in populated areas," NATO said in a statement. "NATO's operation is being conducted under the {{W|United Nations Security Resolution 1973}}, which calls for an immediate end to all attacks against civilians and authorized all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya."

The Libyan government has been under international pressure to step down after it had been accused of killing civilians indiscriminately with mortars, snipers, and bombings of suspected rebels in areas like [[Tripoli]] and {{w|Misrata}}. The government was also accused last month of using Red Cross Helicopters to evade the no-fly zone enforcement to bomb targets in Misrata.

UN passes LGBT rights resolution
{{date|June 18, 2011}}

{{LGBT}}The [[United Nations]] {{W|UN Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council}} has for the first time passed a proposal condemning discrimination against [[LGBT]] people. The vote in [[Geneva]] passed 23&ndash;19, with opposition coming from [[Africa]]n and Islamic Arab nations.

[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|left|upright|Flag of the [[United Nations]] {{Image source|Wilfried Huss / Anonymous}}]]
[[South Africa]] proposed the resolution, which calls for a report on global discrimination based upon sexual orientation and announces "grave concern at acts of violence and discrimination, in all regions of the world, committed against individuals because of their sexual orientation and gender identity." "The resolution before us today does not seek to impose values on other states," said South African delegate Jerry Matthews Matjila, presenting his nation's proposal on the final day of the council's latest eighteen-day session. "It seeks to initiate a dialogue which will contribute to us ending discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity."

{{QuoteRight|The resolution before us today ... seeks to initiate a dialogue which will contribute to us ending discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity.|4=South African delegate Jerry Matthews Matjila}}
The [[European Union]], [[United States]], and [[Latin America]]n nations including [[Brazil]] agreed. [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Russia]] were among the opposition; five members did not take either side &mdash; [[China]], [[Burkina Faso]], and [[Zambia]] entered abstentions, [[Kyrgyzstan]] failed to vote and [[Libya]] is suspended.

[[Nigeria]]n delegate Ositadinma Anaedu said, "We are dealing with a matter that falls outside of human rights," and [[Pakistan]]i Shafqat Ali Khan said on the {{W|Organisation of the Islamic Conference}}'s behalf "We are seriously concerned at the attempt to introduce to the United Nations some notions that have no legal foundation in any international human rights instrument."

[[Amnesty International]] rejected this notion. "The principle of non-discrimination and equal protection of the law applies even to people who are excluded sometimes based on their sexual orientation and gender identity," Whitney Brown said for the organisation. "You can see [the resolution] as an authoritative interpretation of binding treaty law, which does prohibit discrimination." Amnesty claims 76 nations prohibit same-sex relationships.

{{QuoteLeft|The Human Rights Council has taken a first bold step into territory previously considered off-limits.|4=Human Rights Watch}}
South Africa was accused by other African nations of failing to support its neighbours in favour of Western nations. A [[Mauritania]]n diplomat alleged the resolution seeks "to replace the natural rights of a human being with an unnatural right." South Africa is the first nation to specifically address sexual discrimination in its constitution, which was written in the 1990s.

{{W|Human Rights Watch}} welcomed the move. "The Human Rights Council has taken a first bold step into territory previously considered off-limits," said Graeme Reid, head of LGBT rights at Human Rights Watch. "Today’s resolution breaks the silence that has been maintained for far too long," said gay rights campaigners {{W|ARC International}}'s John Fisher. [[Hillary Clinton]], {{W|US Secretary of State}}, also welcomed the resolution: "This represents a historic moment to highlight the human rights abuses and violations that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people face around the world based solely on who they are and whom they love."

The review of anti-LGBT discrimination is anticipated to be over by the year's end.

UN report says 80 per cent of world's refugees live in poor countries
{{date|June 22, 2011}}
[[File:UNHCR DADAAB REGION, KENYA AFRICA DOD 2006.JPEG|thumb|left|125px|UNHCR aid delivered to {{w|Kenya}}. {{image source|DoD photo by: TSgt Steve Staedler}}]]

Reflecting an  "overwhelming imbalance", the  majority  of the  world's {{w|Displaced person|forcibly displaced refugees}} have been taken in by poor, {{w|developing countries}}, not  industrialized countries, according to the  2010 Global Trends report by the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|High Commissioner for Refugees}} (UNHCR) released on Monday. The report states that many of the poorest countries in the world have accommodated the largest numbers of refugees in absolute terms and also in proportion to their economies.

[[File:Nyanzale camp Congo.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|{{w|Nyanzale}}, in the {{w|Masisi}}, {{w|Congo}} refugee camp. {{image source|Julien Harneis}}]] 
There were 43.7 million people  displaced worldwide at the end of 2010, according to the report, more than half children.  UNHCR works in over 120 countries and includes both refugees forced to flee a country  as well as those forced out of areas in their own country. The global total is broken down into the following categories: 15.4 million {{w|refugee|refugees}}, 27.5 million internally displaced people, and another 840,000 people awaiting to be assigned to {{w|Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|refugee status}}. 

In addition, there are an  estimated 12 million {{w|Statelessness|stateless people}} around the world; people who lack even the basic identity  of a nationality. Since 2004, the  reported numbers of  stateless populations has steadily increased.

According to the report, [[Pakistan]]'s 1.9 million refugee population is the largest, followed by  [[Iran]] with 1.1 million and [[Syria]] with 1 million. The neighboring nations of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] accounted for the largest number of people fleeing.

The report states: "Pakistan also has the biggest economic impact with 710 refugees for each US dollar of its per capita {{w|Gross Domestic Product}} (GDP), followed by [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Kenya]] with 475 and 247 refugees respectively. By comparison, [[Germany]], the industrialized country with the largest refugee population (594,000 people), has 17 refugees for each dollar of per capita GDP."

[[File:Evstafiev-travnik-refugees.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Refugees arriving at {{w|Travnik}}, central [[Bosnia]], during the war in 1993. {{image source|[[:commons:User:Evstafiev|Evstafiev]]}}]] 
The new report depicts a very different situation than  when the UN refugee agency was founded in 1950 to deal with the  2.1 million Europeans displaced by {{w|World War Two}}. And it comes at a time when anti-refugee feelings are increasing in many industrialized countries.

{{quoteRight|Fears about supposed floods of refugees in industrialized countries are being vastly overblown or mistakenly conflated with issues of migration. Meanwhile, it's poorer countries that are left having to pick up the burden.|source=António Guterres, UN High Commissioner for Refugees}}
"Fears about supposed floods of refugees in industrialized countries are being vastly overblown or mistakenly conflated with issues of migration. Meanwhile, it's poorer countries that are left having to pick up the burden", said {{w|António Guterres}}, UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

UNHCR UK spokesman Mans Nyberg called for greater urgency in conflict resolution: "We are also concerned with the 7m people in protracted situations who are living in camps for more than 10 years, sometimes even 30 years. We are really appealing to the international community to put more efforts into conflict resolution so that these situations can be resolved."

The report notes that in  2010 [[Japan]] resettled 18 families from [[Myanmar]], becoming the first [[Asia]]n country to accept refugees.

The large number of people that fled [[Libya]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and Syria in 2011, were not tallied in the report.

Serving as a Soldier and Officer of the Republic for the last 20 years at home and on four deployments with honor, award and distinction. 

Completing my training and certification as an Air Traffic Controller in the {{w|Federal Aviation Administration}}. Continuing my education in Philosophy and Law when time, convenience and the rigors of leading a family easily could have dissuaded me. 

Running a principled [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressional]] Campaign which was based upon the {{w|United States Constitution|Constitution}} and the {{W|Liberty|anchor=Philosophy|Philosophy of Liberty}} and which NEVER personally attacked my opponent but engaged him rigorously on policy and the issues.

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''What historical or contemporary figures do you admire?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}The Philosophers who argued for the importance of Reason, Freedom and Liberty. The statespersons who were audacious enough to put those philosophies into practice, even at the expense of their own Lives, Liberty or Property. 

Every single Soldier, Sailor, Airperson, Marine, Doctor and/or Nurse who has fought with honor to defend the Republic, even if I will never know all their names, as well as their spouses who supported them in that endeavor. Every person -- great and not -- who has struggled for the full equality of the body politic. 

First among these for me are {{w|Leonidas I|King Leonidas}}, {{w|Pericles}} , {{w|Jesus Christ|Jesus}}, {{w|Cicero}}, {{w|Pelagius}}, {{w|Galileo Galilei}}, {{w|Leonardo Da Vinci}}, {{w|Sir Isaac Newton}}, {{w|John Locke}}, {{w|Voltaire}}, {{w|George Washington}}, {{w|Thomas Jefferson}}, {{w|Alexander Hamilton}}, {{w|Benjamin Franklin}}, {{w|John Adams}}, {{w|Thomas Paine}}, {{w|John Paul Jones}}, {{w|Frédéric Bastiat|Fredric Bastiat}}, {{w|Abraham Lincoln}}, {{w|Fredrick Douglass}}, {{w|Robert Gould Shaw|Col. Robert Gould Shaw}}, {{w|Settainte (White Bear)}}, {{w|Sitting Bear|Set-ankeah (Sitting Bear)}}, {{w|George Patton}}, {{w|John F. Kennedy}}, {{w|Martin Luther King, Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.}}, Charles Allen Rochelle, Dr. Richard Michael Settainte Harris, Sam W. Barnes, [[Ron Paul]] and {{w|Rand Paul}}. {{w|Aspasia}}, {{w|Hypatia}}, {{w|Mary Magdalene}}, every woman tortured to death for refusing to either declare herself a witch (or renounce the same) to the Church, {{w|Anne Boleyn}}, {{w|Mary Wollstonecraft}}, {{w|Betsy Ross}}, {{w|Annie Oakley}}, {{w|Margaret Brown|Molly Brown}}, {{w|Marilyn Monroe}}, {{w|Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Onassis Kennedy}}, {{w|Elizabeth Taylor}}, Rosalie Rochelle, {{w|Nicole Kidman}}, {{w|Danica Patrick}}, {{w|Debra Medina}}, D. Jill Barnes, and Jennifer R. Harris.      

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''Who did you support in the {{w|United States presidential election, 1996|1996}}, {{w|United States presidential election, 2000|2000}}, {{w|United States presidential election, 2004|2004}} and {{w|United States presidential election, 2008|2008}} presidential elections?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}{{w|Pat Buchanan}}, [[George W. Bush]], George W. Bush, [[Ron Paul]]. Earlier on in my adult life, my political activities were limited to voting for the same party candidates as had my parents. However, as I began to read the Constitution thoroughly, and in the wake of its many abuses perpetrated by those same candidates, I began looking for others who espoused to strictly follow the Constitution as well as the Founders' Philosophies which underlie it. 

This pursuit led me to Ron Paul and the discovery of Libertarianism. I will never again vote for any candidate based upon their party affiliation. What will now and forever dominate my decision is a candidate's demonstrated commitment to the Constitution and the Philosophy of Liberty.  

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''Have you run for public office previously?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}Yes, I was a {{w|United States House of Representatives elections in Oklahoma, 2010|anchor=Congressional District 4|U.S. Congressional Candidate from Oklahoma's 4th District}}. Due to no {{w|ballot access}} in Oklahoma for Libertarian Party Candidates at that time, I ran as a "Ron Paul" Libertarian {{w|Republican Party (United States)|Republican}}. Though Ron himself has a policy of non-endorsement of GOP [{{W|Republican Party (United States)|Republican}}] primary challengers against GOP incumbents, I was able to secure the endorsement of Senator {{W|Rand Paul}} for my congressional campaign.   

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''Why did you choose to run as a Libertarian?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}Because no other party so ardently champions the Philosophy of Liberty over {{w|Socialism}} and Constitutional Governance over Tyranny. Were they alive today, every single one of the Founders would be Libertarians. Since that age, each new generation's battle to tear down the scourges of racism, sexism, classism, bigotry, political persecution and/or religious intolerance, has been made possible by appeal to the principles espoused in the Constitution even if the people who ratified it were limited by the tolerance levels of their own generation. 

Thus has the time come for candidates running on our Founders' Platform to rise up, proud of the political lineage whose generations' long aim has been the complete equality of the body politic, yet humble and weary of how prejudice undermines that legacy as well as the Philosophy of Liberty itself. Giving in to socialism will not erase the moral mistakes of the past, but it will return our children to the states of slavery and involuntary servitude against which we have so long struggled. 

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''What do you feel sets you apart from your fellow contenders for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}I do more than preach Libertarianism, or [[wikt:prognosticate|prognosticate]] about all the ways the GOP or the DNC [{{W|Democratic National Committee|Democrat}}] candidates will most certainly carry on with their tyrannies and usurpations of power, given the opportunity. 

I articulate bold policy positions, as well as the means to institute them, based upon the Philosophy of Liberty and the Constitution with the aim of restoring Freedom, Liberty and the Republic. This is the definition of political courage, as taking these strong positions makes me a target for the bullets and blows of the enemies of Liberty. 

But we are in the fight of our age and we must have champions willing to trade blows with the enemy, not merely repeat Libertarian platitudes.  Educational campaigns have been the mainstay of the Libertarian Party since its founding; but if we are going to take that next step — to actually convince the body politic that we can put into policy that which we preach, then we must nominate a candidate who is not afraid step out, armed with the courage of conviction and lead on every issue. 

Of course our ability to do this is tied to cogent articulation of the philosophy which underlies our political ideology, but for too long have our other candidates engaged in academic debates for their own sake, and not actually deigned to apply that for which they argue to that which they will do. That being said, the biggest thing that separates me from my Libertarian Colleagues is that I am not running this race merely to educate or to increase the Party's ballot access; I am running to win and I believe with all my heart that we can be -- and that we must be -- victorious.   

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''How often do you campaign and how would that change if you won the nomination?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}I campaign for several hours each day. Once I win the nomination the only thing that will change is that I will have to add much more travel to the schedule. 

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''If elected, what would you do as president?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}I will defend the Republic and the Lives, Liberty and Property of {{W|We the People}}. This I will do by way of projecting to the world our strength at home and in {{W|International Waters}}; and by ending all government infringements of the Constitution and of the {{w|Natural and legal rights|People's Natural Rights}}. The authority to act on this promise is found in the {{w|Oath of office of the President of the United States|President's constitutional Oath of Office}} to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." I will do no more than this and certainly no less.

===Policy===
{{WNIQ|William Saturn}}'''What necessary freedoms are currently lacking in American society?'''

{{WNIR|R.J. Harris}}With the exception of the {{w|Third Amendment to the United States Constitution|3rd Amendment}}, the Natural Rights codified in, and the privileges and immunities established by, the remaining nine amendments of the {{w|United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights}}, along with elements of the {{w|Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th}} and {{w|Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th}} amendments, are routinely infringed by all {{w|Separation of powers|three branches of the federal government}} through their collective and Progressive Establishment of Socialism in place of Freedom and Liberty. 

These charges are made manifest by appeal to some of the very same made by the Founders of this Republic against the {{w|List of English monarchs|King of England}} for promulgating some of the same tyrannies which are now being foisted upon We the People by our own federal government. 

To enumerate only a few levied by the {{w|United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence}} our federal government has 

1. "…erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their Substance." 

2. "…kept among us, in Times of Peace, [and at our expense] standing Armies…" 

3. "…combined with others [<nowiki/>[[NATO]] and the [[United Nations]]] to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving [its] Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation." 

4. "…[cut]off our Trade with all Parts of the World [for products or services with which the elected majority finds disfavor]" 

5. "…[imposed] taxes upon us without our consent [by way of deficit spending which will have to be repaid by those not yet old enough to vote]" 

6. "…suspended {{w|Habeas Corpus}} and deprived "…us in many Cases of the Benefits of Trial by Jury [{{w|USA PATRIOT Act|The Patriot Act}} and {{w|Guantanamo Bay detention camp|GITMO}}] 

7. "…[taken] away our Charters, [abolished] our most valuable Laws, and [altered] fundamentally the Forms of our Governments" [this referring to the federal government's many infringements of out states' sovereignty] 

8. "…[declared] themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in [nearly] all Cases whatsoever" [by way of gross misuse of the {{w|Commerce Clause}}, the {{w|Supremacy Clause|Supremacy Clauses}} as well as many others to pass, sign and uphold onerous legislation which would never be countenanced by a free People] 

9. waged the {{w|War on Drugs|Drug}} and {{w|War on Terror|Terror}} "…War(s) against us [and in so doing] has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coasts, burned [or seized] our [property], [invaded our privacy, killed citizens attempting to defend their property, sexually assaulted women and children attempting to travel] and destroyed the Lives of our People."

"In every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble Terms [by begging for the cessation of: bailouts ({{w|Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP}}), social welfares ({{w|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obama Care}}), undeclared foreign Wars ({{w|Korean War|Korea}}, {{w|Vietnam War|Vietnam}}, {{w|Operation Gothic Serpent|Somalia}}, [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and {{w|2011 military intervention in Libya|Libya}}), {{w|No taxation without representation|taxation without representation}} and the devaluation of our Wealth ({{w|deficit spending}} and the over-printing of a declining and unconstitutional {{w|Banknote|paper currency}}), the theft and destruction of our Property ({{w|Eminent Domain}}) along with the killing and incarceration of our People (the Civil War on Drugs), the sexual assault of our Women and Children in the name of security ({{w|Transportation Security Administration|TSA}}), the gross infringements of our Privacy (the Patriot Act) ]: 

Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated Injury [after TARP came bailouts for a host of corporations, the social welfares are too numerous to list, the War in Libya goes on despite its gross unconstitutionality as does the {{w|War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan}} despite having met the objectives contained in the Letter of Reprisal authorizing our actions there, the debt limit is about to be raised once again, the {{w|Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve}} continues its {{W|quantitative easing}} (money printing), the Civil War on Drugs rages on despite the previous failure of prohibition and trillions spent to curb private behavior in the name of morality all to no avail, the sexual assaults being perpetrated by the TSA continue despite several state legislatures attempting to nullify them, the Patriot Act was just extended and all of this despite most of these actions not having the approval of the VAST majority of the People]. 

A Prince [or central Government] whose Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a free People." 
 
It should be clear then by the enumeration of this "long Train of Abuses and Usurpations," which represents but a tiny fraction of the same which our central government is using to pursue "invariably the same Object" and that it "evinces a Design to reduce [us] under absolute Despotism." 

Thus by the precedent established by the Declaration of Independence, and the Founding of the Republic itself under similar, if not even less trying circumstances, that it is the Right and Duty of We the People to use the political process still available to us to "throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for [our] future Security" as well as restore our Constitution and our Republic. 
 
As a potential Candidate for the Libertarian Party's Presidential Nomination I would encourage the People to begin this restorative political process by electing to the Office of President the MOST Constitutionally Libertarian Candidate available and to continue it by doing the same in the election of all future federal representatives to the [[US Congress|Congress]] REGARDLESS of their perceived political experience. 

For certainly it is the case that nearly every single member of all three branches of the federal government are very experienced career politicians and yet the state of our Republic and the condition of our Freedom and Liberty are worse off now that they have been at any time since our founding.                

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''When is government necessary?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}To protect the Lives, Liberty and Property of the Citizens of the Republic.

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''In a market with little or no government regulation, what prevents an entity from seizing the entire means of production and becoming the new main regulator?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}The freedom and innovation of inventors and the entrepreneurialism of their investors to produce substitute markets, products and/or services to compete with any of the same being seized or monopolized.  

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''In context of government's role, what are your stands on the legality of {{w|incest}}, {{w|bestiality}} and {{w|child pornography}}?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}As reprehensible as are incest and bestiality, policing them remains a matter of state sovereignty under the {{w|Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|10th Amendment}}. However, allowance of child pornography entails the government's enforcement of {{w|Fifth Amendment to the United States Consitution|5th}}, 13th and 14th Amendment violations against children and could therefore be policed by the Federal Government should the States or {{W|Indigenism|Native Nations}} fail to do so.   

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''Do you disagree with any parts of the Bill of Rights?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}No.

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''Should the people of the United States have a right to constitutionally amend the Bill of Rights to increase the power of the federal government and limit individual rights?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}Yes, according to {{W|John Locke|Locke}}, our Founders, {{W|Bastiat}} and the Philosophy of Liberty, no government actions conducted outside the consent of the People are legitimate. The Constitution is our codification of that consent and, as such, it is supreme over all other political ideologies. Of course I would very publicly argue, using the Philosophy of Liberty, for the People to NEVER consider such measures but it is their right to affect them by way of the amendment process. 

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''Should the lives of American citizens be valued above citizens of other nations?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}As it applies to the Natural Rights, those being Life, Liberty and Property, of all People found to be under the jurisdiction of the United States; no. However, as it applies to providing for the common Defense of We the People and the Republic; yes.      

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''What are your views on immigration?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}I will fight to eliminate the social {{w|welfare state}} and the high taxes required to pay for it, which are chasing our jobs and prosperity overseas. Simultaneously, I will seek from the Congress a very robust and permissive immigration policy to help grow our {{w|American middle class|middle class}}, making us more competitive with other emerging markets around the world.

I will deploy the {{w|United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals}} backed up by the {{W|US National Guard|National Guard}} to protect Border State property owners from violent cross-border organized crime enterprises and syndicates. 

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''When is war necessary?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}When the Lives, Liberty or Property of We the People are being infringed by a foreign entity.

{{WNIQ|WS}}'''Are you a {{w|9/11 Truth movement|truther}}, {{w|Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birther}}, neither or both?'''

{{WNIR|RH}}Neither, although I do intend to ensure the highest level of executive and administrative transparency which will do much to resolve the propensity of some towards conspiracy theories, as well as expose potential conspiracies before they can fully develop. Since this {{w|Open government|transparency}} has been sorely lacking from our government of late, I will direct the {{w|United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice}} to fully investigate any reasonably perceived recent lapses in the executive oversight of the federal government's activities.

Libyan rebels and Gaddafi troops in battle on two fronts
{{date|March 17, 2011}}
{{Libya}}
[[Libya]]n government forces and rebel fighters have been fighting in two different cities Wednesday, in both the east and west of the country.

Fighting was reported in the cities of {{w|Ajdabiya}}, an eastern city that is the last settlement before [[Benghazi]], the main rebel location, and in {{w|Misrata}}, the only town still controlled by rebels in western Libya.  Rebels claimed to have held off government troops in both cities, though dozens of people are reported dead in the latest violence.

Control of Ajdabiya has reportedly shifted between government and rebel troops in the past two days. Government forces apparently captured the city during the day on Tuesday, but retreated by evening. On Wednesday, the city was under attack by airplanes, tanks and mortars. At the end of the day, the rebels still appeared to control much of the city.

According to a doctor in the city, at least 26 people have died in Ajdabiya in the past two days. On Tuesday, Libyan state TV reported that Ajdabiya was "totally controlled and is being cleansed of armed gangs." However, a rebel official later said that "[t]here's heavy, sustained tank shelling and earlier there were air strikes, but now the revolutionaries managed to take seven tanks from those dogs and, God willing, we will succeed."

Rebel leaders also claimed that warplanes and a helicopter under their command had been involved in the fighting, and said they had superior weapons than government forces. Outside the city, however, government forces were reported to be amassing several hundred troops, as well as increasing supplies of ammunition and weaponry.

In Misrata, rebels claim that they had repelled government forces using tanks and other artillery weapons, though this could not be confirmed. Eleven people are reported to have died on Wednesday in Misrata.

International diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation continue. [[France|French]] president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] wrote to the [[UN Security Council]] in support of a proposed resolution that includes the establishment of a no-fly zone in Libya. The international community is still split on the idea of military intervention, though; while the {{w|Arab League}} supports a no-fly zone, a [[G8]] meeting on Tuesday ended without support for the idea.

Former Rwandan government minister Nyiramasuhuko convicted of genocide
{{date|June 24, 2011}}
{{Rwanda}}
[[File:Genocide Victims Rwanda Photo by Sascha Grabow.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mass grave memorial for victims of the 1994 Rwandan  genocide {{image source|[[:commons:User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]}}]]
A [[United Nations]] court today convicted a woman, a former minister in the [[Rwanda]]n government, for her role in the {{w|Rwandan Genocide|1994 genocide}} in the ethnic war between the {{w|Tutsi}} and the {{w|Hutu}} peoples. 

{{w|Pauline Nyiramasuhuko}}, 65, was found guilty of seven charges including publicly inciting {{w|genocide}} and {{w|International_Criminal_Tribunal_for_Rwanda#Rape|rape}}, and conspiracy to commit genocide "as part of a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population on political, ethnic and racial grounds," said the {{w|International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda}} (ICTR), a UN backed court in {{W|Arusha}}, [[Tanzania]]. 

Nyiramasuhuko, who was the Rwandan of Minister of Family and Women's Affairs in {{W|Juvénal Habyarimana}}'s government in 1994 when about 800,000 mostly ethnic Tutsis were killed, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison today. Her son, Arsene Shalom Ntahobali, a {{w|militia}} leader charged with {{w|Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity}}, [[war crimes]], and rape, was also convicted and sentenced to life. Four local officials were  found guilty on genocide charges and given prison sentences ranging from 25 years to life.

According to prosecutor Holo Makwaia, Nyiramasuhuko intended to "destroy in whole or in part the Tutsi ethnic group in Butare". Following the genocide, she fled Rwanda and was arrested in {{W|Nairobi}}, [[Kenya]], in 1997.

Presiding Judge William Sekule read the judgment: "Many were physically assaulted, raped and taken away to various places in Butare, where they were killed. During the course of these repeated attacks on vulnerable civilians, both Nyiramasuhuko and Ntahobali ordered killings. They also ordered rapes. Ntahobali further committed rapes and Nyiramasuhuko aided and abetted rapes."

Nyiramasuhuko is the first woman convicted of genocide by the ICTR, which was established in 1994 after approximately 800,000 Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus were massacred during the genocide.

UN General Assembly opens with rhetorical appeals by both Bush and Ahmadinejad
{{date|September 20, 2006}}
[[Image: UN General Assembly 2006.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The UN General Assembly convened with 192-member nations in New York City. ]] 
During the opening day of the 61st annual [[UN]] {{w|United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly}} on Tuesday, [[Iran]]ian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Ahmadinejad]] used his address to challenge the effectiveness of the {{w|UN Security Council}}.

"Can a council in which they [the [[United States]] and [[UK|Britain]]] are privileged members address their violations? Has this ever happened?" President Ahmadinejad asked the assembly. "In fact we have repeatedly seen the reverse."

"The persistence of some hegemonic powers in imposing their exclusionist policies on international decision making mechanisms, including the Security Council, has resulted in a growing mistrust in global public opinion, undermining the credibility and effectiveness of this most universal system of collective security," President Ahmadinejad said.  

The US President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] address earlier on Tuesday spoke both to the assembly and the world Islamic population.

"Freedom, by its nature, cannot be imposed &mdash; it must be chosen. From Beirut to Baghdad, people are making the choice for freedom. And the nations gathered in this chamber must make a choice, as well: Will we support the moderates and reformers who are working for change across the Middle East &mdash; or will we yield the future to the terrorists and extremists?" President Bush asked.

"My country desires peace. Extremists in your midst spread propaganda claiming that the West is engaged in a war against Islam. This propaganda is false and its purpose is to confuse you and justify acts of terror," said President Bush. "We must seek stability through a free and just Middle East where the extremists are marginalized by millions of citizens in control of their own destinies."

"To the people of Iran," President Bush said, "You deserve an opportunity to determine your own future, an economy that rewards your intelligence and your talents, and a society that allows you to fulfill your tremendous potential. The greatest obstacle to this future is that your rulers have chosen to deny you liberty and to use your nation's resources to fund terrorism, and fuel extremism, and pursue nuclear weapons."

President Ahmadinejad was not present for the mid-afternoon address by President Bush.
Ahmadinejad also did not attend the UN's traditional banquet for visiting presidents, princes and prime ministers, where dignitaries have a chance to mix informally, because alcohol (the consumption of which is forbidden in Islam) was served at the banquet. The banquet this year was held in honor of UN Secretary {{w|Kofi Anan}}, who will step down after two consecutive 5-year terms ending December 31.

[[Image:Darfur map.png|right|200px|thumb|Darfur region in western Sudan]]
{{date|November 18, 2006}}

Speaking in {{w|Khartoum}} today, {{w|Jan Egeland}}, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator of the [[United Nations]], said “this is the moment of truth. We are playing with a powder keg”. This followed disagreement about the role that UN would play in providing a force to help deal with the crisis in [[Darfur]].

[[Kofi Annan]], retiring {{w|UN Secretary General}}, yesterday announced agreement of African, Arab and European leaders to provide a 20,000 force to supplement the 7,000 [[African Union]] peacekeepers trying to cope with the situation that had resulted in 240,000 being killed and 2.5 million being displaced during three years of conflict in the western region. 
[[Image:Kofi Annan.jpg|thumb|right|Annan—disagreement over joint peacekeeping force]]
However, {{w|Lam Akol}}, the [[Sudan]]ese foreign minister, said: "What we agreed upon in [[Addis Ababa]] was the [[African Union]] (AU) force assuming full command, while the UN role would be confined to providing technical and logistical assistance to the AU mission." No dates had been agreed for the deployment of the UN forces.

Egeland said that the delay would cause the situation to become infinitely worse and would prevent the ingress of humanitarian aid to the millions affected.

===New violence===

The African Union is reported as saying that Birmaza, a northern village, has been attacked by the Sudanese government troops and {{w|Janjaweed}} militia with air support. 70 dead are reported. The Sudan government has denied that it supports the Janjaweed.

===Darfur conflict threatens to spread===

[[Chad]] Prime Minister {{w|Pascal Yoadimnadji}} says that “mercenaries in the pay of the Sudanese” have invaded towns in northeast [[Central African Republic]]. He said troops would be sent to help the Republic resist these incursions. Sudan continues to deny supporting the mercenaries.

Former Prime Minister of Finland Harri Holkeri dies aged 74
{{date|August 9, 2011}}
{{Finland}}
[[File:Holkeri.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Holkeri was Prime Minister from 1987 until 1991]]
{{w|Harri Holkeri|Harri Holkeri}}, former {{w|Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister}} of [[Finland]] and renowned peacemaker, has died at the age of 74. He was known for his role as co-chairman of the multi-party talks to resolve the conflicts in [[Northern Ireland]]. His efforts helped form the {{w|Belfast Agreement|Good Friday agreement}}. Holkeri also served as [[U.N.]] {{w|United Nations General Assembly|foreign=suppress|General Assembly}} president and as a special representative to [[Kosovo]].

After serving as Prime Minister of Finland from 1987 until 1991 and unsuccessfully running for President in 1982 and 1988, Holkeri focused his attention outside of Finland. He co-chaired the Northern Ireland talks with former [[US]] [[US Senate|Senator]] {{w|George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell}} and retired [[Canada|Canadian]] General {{w|John de Chastelain}}, and honoured with a knighthood from [[Queen Elizabeth II]] after the Good Friday agreement was made.

Northern Irish politician and leader of {{w|Sinn Féin}} [[Gerry Adams]] said "Harri Holkeri enjoyed a distinguished career as prime minister of Finland, and in several prominent UN roles, including in Kosovo. But it will be for his work here alongside George Mitchell in co-chairing the talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement for which he will be most remembered internationally."

Current Prime Minister of Finland, {{w|Jyrki Katainen|Jyrki Katainen}} said "Holkeri ... was the person who was able to build the confidence of people in difficult situations. This was one of the important personal characteristics that helped him achieve results in important international roles."

In 2003 he became the U.N special representative to Kosovo but resigned less than a year later due to ill health. He was badly injured in 2008 after he was knocked to the ground by a thief escaping from a store. 

He is survived by his wife, two children and six grandchildren.

Pakistan government must investigate killings and abductions of journalists, says UN
{{date|August 23, 2011}}
{{Crime and law}}
The [[United Nations]] (UN) on Friday called on the government of [[Pakistan]] to investigate numerous killings and abductions, particularly of journalists. 

“In the past eight days alone we have received reports on the killing of one journalist, Munir Shakir, in {{w|Balochistan}} on August 14 2011, and the disappearance of another journalist, Rehmatullah Daparkhel, three days earlier in {{w|North Waziristan}} on August 11,” said spokesperson for the {{w|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights}}, Rupert Colville.

According to the {{w|Committee to Protect Journalists}}, nine journalists have been killed in Pakistan this year, and at least 16 were killed in 2010. None of the killings had been investigated satisfactorily, Colville said. 

Colville said that the UN would like to see the government review all of the incidents. “We call on all responsible parties to immediately stop such violations of human rights, and we urge the government to take immediate steps to independently investigate these cases,” he said. 

[[Amnesty International]] has also urged the government of Pakistan to ensure the protection of journalists and media workers in the country. They have further called upon the Pakistani authorities to investigate attacks on journalists and to try those responsible in line with internationally recognised standards of human rights.

Colville said that the recent attacks on journalists were not uncommon in Pakistan and that many journalist groups regard the country as one of the most dangerous places to work.

Shakir was shot dead after covering a protest organized by a Baloch separatist organization. Irshad Matsoi, the bureau chief for the ''Online News Network'' where Shakir worked, said that the killing was linked to the journalist’s work. Journalism in Balochistan is becoming “an endangered profession,” Matsoi said. 

{{w|''Reporters Without Borders'' }} (RWB) have appealed for punishment of those responsible for the murder. According to RWB, journalists do not feel free to report in Balochistan, which has led to self-censorship in the region.

The whereabouts of Daparkhel, kidnapped on August 11, is still unknown. The worldwide press freedom organization said that the government must do everything they can to find him immediately. “It is unacceptable that local journalists have to do the job of the police and investigate on their own using their contacts,” the organization said. 

The {{w|Human Rights Commission of Pakistan}} (HRCP) has condemned the incidents. “There is a growing sense of insecurity among media persons who increasingly interpret each attack on journalists as a warning to ‘behave,’” the HRCP said last Monday. The HRCP also said that in almost all cases of violence against journalists in the last few years, those responsible have not been identified or punished. 

“The HRCP calls upon the government to respond through effective action and not mere words in the next few days, sending a strong message to the mischief makers that it would no longer stand by as a mere spectator as journalists are killed and snatched,” the Commission said.

Delhi earns UN carbon credits
{{date|September 26, 2011}}
{{India}}

[[File:DMRC Bombardier.jpg|thumb|left|One of the new technologically advanced, Bombardier-made trains. {{Image source|[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ghalibonagiddy/  Le Rétroviseur]}}]]
The [[UN]] has certified that the [[Delhi]] {{w|Delhi Metro|Metro}} has aided in the reduction of {{w|greenhouse gases}}, earning 'carbon credits'.  This makes the Delhi Metro the first of its kind in the world to do so.

This comes under the {{w|Clean Development Mechanism}} (CDM) of the UN under the {{w|Kyoto Protocol}}. The UN said the rail based system has helped to save 630,000 tonnes of {{w|pollution}} a year. The credits to the {{w|Delhi Metro Rail Corporation}} (DMRC) are worth $9.5 million for each of the next seven years.  More credits would be given for more passengers on the system.

The credits are designed as a financial incentive for {{w|developing countries}} to reduce greenhouse emissions.

The Delhi Metro was started in 2002. According to the DMRC, it has reduced road traffic by more than 91,000 vehicles per day.

The [[Philippines]] has welcomed the world's seventh billion baby as the {{w|world population}} reaches 7 billion on Monday, October 31, 2011. 

The baby girl was born in {{w|Jose Fabella Hospital}} in {{w|Manila}} weighing 5lbs 5oz. She was given a symbolic cake by the [[United Nations]] and her birth was also witnessed by the symbolic sixth billion baby who is now 12 years old.

The United Nations has declared October 31 as Seven Billion Day when the world's population reaches the seven billion mark.

The Philippines is currently the world's 12th largest country in terms of population with over half of the people under the age of 25. According to the UN Population Fund, 10 percent of girls ages 15-19 are already childbearing. The organization has stated that the birth could highlight the country's population related issues.

UNESCO votes in favor of Palestine membership
{{date|November 2, 2011}}
{{Palestine}}
[[File:UNESCO logo.svg|thumb|left|Emblem of UNESCO]]
The {{w|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization}} has voted in favor of [[Palestine|Palestinian]] membership in the organization. This coincides with the Palestine bid for [[United Nations]] membership also known as {{w|Palestine 194}}.

In early October, the UNESCO executive committee voted in favor for a resolution that allows a vote by all of its 193 members that will decide the membership of the [[State of Palestine]] into the organization. 

UNESCO decided in a meeting of its General Council in [[Paris]] on Monday to admit Palestine as a full member. 107 votes approved entry, 14 opposed, and 52 abstained. 

The move coincides with the Palestinians' bid for full membership in the United Nations. The [[United Nations Security Council]] is currently reviewing the application. Becoming a member of UNESCO is generally perceived as having a positive impact on all of its future bids.  

The Palestinians have been demanding full membership of the United Nations, and this is seen as being one part of that effort. The [[Palestinian National Authority]] is now likely to have greater control to nominate potential world heritage sites on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, such as the {{w|Church of the Nativity}} in [[Bethlehem]].

Ban on cluster bombs adopted by 111 countries
{{date|May 30, 2008}}

Today, representatives of 111 countries have adopted a formal ban on {{w|cluster bombs}}. The ban is to be signed and ratified by each country during December 2-3 in {{w|Oslo}}, [[Norway]], the country that initiated the discussions on the ban.

Following almost two weeks of negotiations, the ban was agreed upon at a ceremony held in {{w|Dublin}}, [[Ireland]]. Signatories will be required to completely get rid of cluster bomb stockpiles within eight years.

Cluster bombs are characterized by the small "bomblets" that they release while falling. Many are opposed to this type of munition because the "bomblets" spread over a large area, meaning that they can easily injure or kill innocent civilians even when aimed at a specific enemy target.

Despite [[U.N.]] {{w|U.N. Secretary-General|Secretary-General}} [[Ban Ki-moon]] voicing his hopes that all nations would agree to the ban, many countries have boycotted the ban, including the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Israel]], [[Pakistan]] and [[India]]. Military analyst Marc Garlasco of the organization [[Human Rights Watch]] noted that these nations will be less likely to use the munitions due to the stigma that will be attached to them.

While widely celebrated, some criticize the pact for not being strong enough in its implications. For example, signatories will still be allowed to cooperate on military operations with non-signatories.

The ban will go into effect in mid-2009.

Gbagbo appears at international court for alleged crimes against humanity
{{date|December 5, 2011}}
{{Ivory Coast}}
[[File:IC Gbagbo Motta eng 195.jpg|thumb|left|[[Laurent Gbagbo]] in 2007. {{image|{{w|Voice of America}}}}]]
Former [[Ivory Coast]] President [[Laurent Gbagbo]] today appeared before the {{w|International Criminal Court}} (ICC) in [[The Hague]] to hear charges against him.  The ICC has charged him with four counts of crimes against humanity regarding events following last year's Ivorian presidential election.

Following the election on November 28, [[Alassane Ouattara]] was internationally recognized as the winner, but Gbagbo maintained he had won.  Subsequent violence killed about 3,000 people.  Gbagbo was arrested in April.

Gbagbo is charged as an "indirect co-perpetrator" in "widespread and systematic" crimes "over an extended time period".  He was moved from Ivory Coast to The Hague last week, which his supporters called "political kidnapping".

Human rights groups have also called for investigation of Ouattara's supporters.  ICC chief prosecutor Louis Moreno-Ocampo said "there is more to come".  [[UN]] high commissioner for human rights Navi Pillay noted that "In all of our reports, we made it clear there were violations of human rights on both sides".

Since the ICC was established in 2002, this is the first time an ex-head of state has been brought before it.  All the cases now being heard by the ICC are African, although some non-African preliminary investigations are underway.  To date, the ICC has never successfully convicted anyone.

Two politicians jailed for life over Rwandan genocide
{{date|December 22, 2011}}
{{Rwanda}}
The {{w|International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda}} (ICTR), supported by the [[United Nations]], has convicted two [[Rwanda]]n politicians in relation to the {{w|Rwandan Genocide|Rwandan genocide}} of 1994.

The court has sentenced then-{{w|National Revolutionary Movement for Development}} (NRMD) chairman Matthieu Ngirumpatse and Edouard Karemera &mdash; at that time, Ngirumpatse's deputy &mdash; to {{w|Life imprisonment|life imprisonment}} having found them guilty over their involvement in a variety of crimes including [[wikt:genocide|genocide]], {{w|War crime|war crimes}}, and {{w|Crimes against humanity|crimes against humanity}}, for failing to stop or punish crimes such as rape and murder committed by the youth militia of their party, the {{w|Interahamwe}}, in 1994.

{{w|Hutu|Hutus}} considered to have extremist views reportedly murdered 800,000 {{w|Tutsi|Tutsis}} and Hutu moderates in the space of one hundred days, between April and July 1994. The ICTR determined that "the rapes and the sexual crimes carried out on Tutsi girls and women by soldiers and militia, including the Interahamwe, are a natural and predictable consequence of the joint criminal enterprise seeking to destroy the Tutsi ethnic group" before "unanimously condemn[ing] Ngirumpatse to life in jail" and subsequently providing a similar punishment to Karemera. Joseph Nzirorera, a third man accused alongside Ngirumpatse and Karemera, died while the trial was underway.

The ICTR found Ngirumpatse had approved weapons distribution amongst the Interahamwe in April 1994. "At that point in the genocide", the ICTR panel stated, "it could be assumed the weapons were going to be used to kill Tutsis".

The ICTR were set up in the city of {{w|Arusha}} in [[Tanzania]] with the specific purpose of trying those accused of being most responsible for the crimes relating to the Rwandan genocide. Recently, Theoneste Bagosora &mdash; suspected of being amongst those of highest responsibility in the Rwandan genocide &mdash; had his life imprisonment punishment reversed by appeal judges at the ICTR and reduced to a 35 year prison sentence. ''{{w|BBC News Online}}'' reported anger amongst some Rwandans over this decision for the chief of staff of the defence ministry at the time.

North and South Korean border guards exchange fire
{{date|August 1, 2006}}

[[North Korea]]n and [[South Korea]]n border guards exchanged fire yesterday across the border, the first such incident in about a year. 

The exchange occurred on July 31, 2006 at sundown, when, according to a claim from Major Kim-Tae-hoon of South Korea, North Korean soldiers fired two shots at a South Korean guard post in the eastern Korean de-militarised zone.

Major Kim Tae-hoon also said that South Koreans returned six rounds of fire.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (the North) and the Republic of Korea (the South) have been at war since 1950, the beginning of the {{w|Korean War}}, which had no peace treaty which was signed by the two parties. The [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Military Armistice Commission|Military Armistice Commission}}, which supervises the armistice that stopped major hostilities during the Korean War, will investigate the event and ask the North Koreans for an explanation.

Two Syrian journalists killed around New Year's Day
{{date|January 3, 2012}}
{{Syria}}
The last two journalists reported killed at the turn of the year were [[Syria]]ns; just at a time when {{w|2011–2012 Syrian uprising|protests}} and violence in the country are escalating, and the {{w|Arab League}} begins its initial assessment of the situation.

Shot on December 30, and the first journalist to die in 2012, was veteran journalist Shukri Ratib Abu Burghol. The senior journalist was shot in the face after arriving home from work at a radio station in {{w|Darayya}}, on the southern outskirts of the capital city {{w|Damascus}}. According to {{w|Reporters Without Borders}}, he died three days after the shooting at Al Mouwsat Hospital.
[[File:Sy-map.png|thumb|180px|left|The Syrian uprising began 11 months ago with a "Day of Rage" on February 3, last year. Homs, north of Damascus, has been a flashpoint of the revolution.]]
Burghol, 56, was a journalist for about 21 years, working for the newspaper ''Al-Thawra'' (''The Revolution'') whilst also hosting a weekly show for Radio Damascus. A source told the Xinhua news agency Burghol had received threats. 

Basil Al-Sayed became the last journalist to die in 2011, shot on December 29 by a sniper in the city of {{w|Homs}}. The Arab League has confirmed that the Syrian government have been seen using snipers against protesters elsewhere in {{w|Daraa}}. The shooting of Al-Sayed took place in the Bab Amr section of Homs. The city has been one of the {{w|Siege of Homs|hot spots}} for protests against {{w|Bashar al-Assad}}'s government during 2011. In the last week of the year, the Bab Amr neighbourhood was {{w|Free Syrian Army|attacked}} by the Syrian military and experienced heavy violence.

The 24-year-old camera operator was a {{w|Citizen journalism|citizen journalist}} who uploaded his videos to {{w|Video hosting service|video-sharing}} sites to spread information about the protests. {{w|Photojournalism|Photojournalists}} and {{w|Camera operator|camera operators}} have been some of the the most at-risk during the Arab uprisings in {{w|Tunisian revolution|Tunisia}} and {{w|2011 Libyan civil war|Libya}}. {{w|Ferzat Jarban}} &mdash; the first known journalist to be killed in Syria &mdash; was a freelance camera operator, arrested on November 19 whilst filming protests in {{w|Al-Qusayr, Syria|Al-Qusayr}}, {{w|Homs Governorate}}. He was found dead the following day. In Syria, citizen journalists like Al-Sayed, and freelancers like Jarban, have been risking their lives by openly recording videos of protests which may serve as documentary evidence of human rights' abuse. 

Currently information is hard to verify and reliable independent sources are largely banned or restricted inside Syria. Foreign journalists have been barred from the country, and from covering the protests.
{{HYS question left|What do you think of people risking their lives to get video footage of the Syrian protests?}}
At the end of 2011 Arab League observers had sent out observers to different cities in Syria to monitor the situation, whilst one of its advisers called for the organization to retreat after Al-Assad's government reneged on agreements to halt the crackdown.

According to {{w|Navi Pillay}}, {{w|High Commissioner for Human Rights}} at the [[United Nations]], more than 5,000 people have been killed during the Syrian uprising, a figure that includes around 300 children.

Three journalists are now known to have been killed in Syria.

In December, the {{w|Committee to Protect Journalists}} (CPJ) addressed an open letter to Syrian President Al-Assad calling for the release of all journalists in detention; the CPJ documented 29 cases of journalists being detained in 2011.

The CPJ reported that 45 journalists were killed worldwide in 2011, whereas &mdash; using differing criteria &mdash; Reporters Without Borders state that 66 journalists around the world died in 2011, and assert that, by almost every indicator, violence and censorship against international journalists was worse in 2011, up 16% on their 2010 figures.

Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world
{{date|January 13, 2012}}
{{Human rights}}
This week [[US]] citizens observed National [[Human trafficking|Human Trafficking]] Awareness Day through acts of education, legislation, and enforcement; whilst, around the world, other people highlighted or tackled this global problem in their own countries.

According to an annual report on human trafficking released by the {{w|United States Department of State|US State Department}} in June last year, 27 million men, women and children are exploited through human trafficking. Worldwide, at least two million children are estimated to be trafficked victims of the sex trade; and, in military conflicts, it is not uncommon for children to be forced to bear arms. In releasing the report last year, Secretary of State [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]] highlighted the importance of international cooperation in addressing trafficking, and cultural issues associated with it.
[[File:Trafficking of women, children and men.png|thumb|left|400px|Brown, orange and red are source countries, while light blue and dark blue countries are destinations for victims of human trafficking. {{image credit|[[Commons:User:KVDP|KVDP]]}}]]
Under the [[United Nations]]' {{w|Convention against Transnational Organized Crime|Palermo Protocols}}, human trafficking encompasses cases where victims are born into slavery, forcibly transported for exploitation, consented to work with a trafficker, and/or were forced to participate in criminal activities. The Protocols also recognize the unique status and rights of children.

=== US-based action ===

Reports from across the United States show a number of communities taking local action to solve, or otherwise highlight, this global problem.

In Southern [[California]], Sister Caritas Foster is an advocate for the area's victims of human trafficking. Commenting on the area's involvement, she stated: "We in the San Francisco Bay Area are one of the largest receiving areas with our borders and coasts". For over four years, Foster has worked on educating the public on human trafficking, speaking to civic and religious groups and describing the power traffickers hold over their victims through vivid accounts of situations trafficked individuals find themselves in. Many have no idea where they are located, suffer under the constant threat of deportation, and most often lack the language abilities to seek help.

[[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] politician Don Knabe said human trafficking was not a distant problem but one that hits close to home. As the county supervisor overseeing the fourth district in Los Angeles County, Knabe cited figures from the Probation Department showing 84 percent of arrests of children on prostitution charges in 2010 were in his district; he believes the overall problem for the county is much larger, and wants the Probation Department to establish a special unit dedicated to sexually exploited minors.

Northward in {{w|Seattle, Washington|Seattle}}, [[Washington]], members of the King County Sheriff's department realized that law enforcement had to deal supportively with the symptoms of human trafficking &mdash; rather than putting victims in jail. This gave birth to the "Genesis Project" where sheriff's deputies offer potential victims of trafficking a comfortable safe haven with amenities for 24 hours, and put them in touch with social services for counselling, job training, and education advice.

Politicians from several states have sought to address the connection between tourism and human trafficking; [[Indiana]]'s state Senate unanimously passed a human trafficking bill on Tuesday morning. Current legislation only considered forced marriage and prostitution as human trafficking; loopholes in the existing laws allowed some forms of human trafficking to escape prosecution. Lawmakers in the state hope to toughen their human trafficking laws, and have new legislation on the statute books in time for the {{w|Super Bowl}}, due to be held in {{w|Indianapolis}} on February 5. The just-passed bill now goes to the House for approval.
{{HYS question left|What can we do to end human slavery in modern times?}}
Also on Tuesday, lawmakers from [[Hawaii]] held a special hearing on human trafficking. Kathryn Xian, of Pacific Alliance to Stop Slavery, says traffickers capitalize on the state's tourist-based economy. She introduced a package of seven bills she says will help prevent human trafficking in the state.

At a national level, the US government continues to work abroad on the issue of trafficking; Luis CdeBaca, a special ambassador for human trafficking, is working with [[Myanmar]], commonly known as Burma, as the country seeks to improve diplomatic relations with the United States. Myanmar was identified by the US State Department as having one of the worst records of forced labor, and as a country that lacks necessary laws to curb human trafficking.

=== Trafficking, the global picture ===
[[File:3.2519 Nepalese-mother1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|File image of a [[Nepal]]i mother who travelled to [[Mumbai]], [[India]], hoping to rescue her teenage daughter from an Indian brothel. {{image credit|[http://www.gtipphotos.state.gov/photos.htm Kay Chernush, US State Dept.]}}]]
Although National Human Trafficking Awareness Day is a US-based effort to recognise, and highlight, this issue &mdash; as a topic of global concern being highlighted through the [[United Nations]], others around the world continue efforts to increase public awareness and tackle trafficking.

Forty-six women from the international group Operation Mobilization sought to raise awareness by climbing [[Tanzania]]'s {{w|Mount Kilimanjaro}}. The summit is called "Uhuru Peak", with ''Uhuru'' meaning "freedom" in {{w|Swahili}}. Each of the non-professional climbers raised {{w|United States dollar|US$}}10,000 to help those affected by human trafficking.

In the Middle East, several countries are reported to have problems with human traffickers recruiting unemployed gay [[Kenya]]n men to become sex slaves. [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Qatar]] are supposedly the more-common destination countries into which Kenyans are lured with offers of high-paying jobs. However, in the [[United Arab Emirates]] &mdash; where no law prohibits trafficking, but homosexuality is illegal &mdash; the problem is compounded.

Enforcement of existing laws, and acting against trafficking, are seen as key steps in reducing the activity. Showing that no country is unaffected, [[Northern Ireland]] police are currently investigating five sex trafficking cases; and, on Monday, [[Philippines|Filipino]] police rescued fifteen women following a tip-off regarding women recruited, and being held, prior to being sent to work abroad.

In the Northern Ireland situation, Detective Superintendent Philip Marshall stated that fifteen men are to be contacted, suspected of having paid for sex with trafficked women. Identifying victims within the [[UK]], or victims seeking help, is becoming more challenging with the sex industry having switched to using hotel rooms as-opposed to street corners. Many victims of trafficking are found to be unaware of where within the country they are.

In the Philippines situation, {{w|Zamboanga City}} police are still seeking the recruiter of the fifteen women rescued in Rio Hondo.

A range of complexities are involved in the sentencing of both those convicted of human trafficking, and their victims. In one [[Canada|Canadian]] case, 43-year-old Hungarian Lajos Domotor pled guilty to trafficking men and women into forced labor. Following being charged with conspiracy to commit human trafficking, he developed terminal stomach cancer and has been given a 10 to 15 percent chance of living five years.

In the UK, officials are seeking to detect exploitation prior to sentencing &mdash; as a counter to the high number of foreign women in jails, frequently having been victims of trafficking. One in seven women prisoners across England and Wales are foreign, with the primary offenses being drug or immigration-related. A report into the issue recommends sentencing decisions should consider the role of women, and of coercion, in such cases.

Artists also have a special role to play in the education and awareness of the public. The first opera about sex trafficking will premiere in Liverpool, England, on March 7. ''Anya17'' was composed by Adam Gorb with a libretto written by Ben Kaye. Performers will come from Manchester's Royal Northern College of Music and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic contemporary music ensemble 10/10. Funding for the production was provided in part by the United Nations.

TESEV Report on Eastern Turkey for UNDP released
{{date|November 24, 2006}} {{Turkey}}
According to a report released by the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation ([http://www.tesev.org.tr/eng/ TESEV]) for United Nation's Development Plan, the per capita GNP in Eastern Turkey, an area predominantly inhabited by Kurdish people, is as low as seven percent of that of the European Union on average. The report analyzed a region of 21 cities in Eastern Turkey*. One of the cities included in the report, Şırnak, was reported to be as poor as [[w:Botswana|Botswana]], [[w:Southern Africa|Southern Africa]]. 

Other points highlighted in the report included:
* 60% of the population in the region was under the poverty line. If this situation persists, people may start to migrate to Northern [[Iraq]]. 
* If 1% of the national income is spent on Eastern Turkey's infrastructure and social investment for 7 years, the region will be enabled to finance itself. If the economic and social conditions in the region are fixed, the fragile relationship between the Turkish government and the Kurdish people of the region may improve. 
* Access to health services is a primary human right. Without access to health services, one cannot expect that people of this region can live in confidence. Health institutions should employ nurses who speak Kurdish so the patients can communicate with the health services staff. 
* The use of the private sector is not reliable as a solution. The government should act to remedy the lack of infrastructure in the region.

New York police confirm cocaine shipment seizure at UN Headquarters
{{date|January 29, 2012}}
{{Crime and law}}

Spokespersons for {{w|New York City Police Department|New York City Police Department [NYPD]}} and [[Ban Ki-moon]], {{w|Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General of the United Nations [UN]}}, Thursday released statements confirming a police seizure of a shipment of two bags, containing sixteen kilograms of [[wikt:cocaine|cocaine]], at the mail intake centre for the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Headquarters|Headquarters}} on January 16.

The shipment consisted of fourteen hollowed-out books with the cocaine inside, according to ''{{w|ABC News (Australia)|ABC News Australia}}''. Although the shipment, which had been sent from [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] via {{w|Cincinnati}}, [[Ohio]], had no addresses or names on it, it was stamped with an apparently low quality copy of the [[United Nations]] logo.

Speaking on behalf of Ki-moon, Martin Nesirky stated: "The United Nations nor anyone located in the United Nations was the intended recipient of this delivery and the bags were not UN bags, diplomatic or other". {{w|Gregory B. Starr}}, Under-Secretary-General for Safety and Security at the United Nations, also believed that there was "nothing to indicate that this had anything to do with anybody at the United Nations"; they "did not come from a United Nations facility", according to Starr.

Paul Browne, NYPD deputy commissioner, said that the bags were "obviously fakes". According to ''{{w|RT (TV network)|RT}}'', the shipment was supposedly sent to the UN Headquarters unintentionally. "Somebody in Mexico is probably in trouble now having let a significant amount of cocaine out of their possession," Browne stated. Browne believed the shipment was "possibly ... never meant to have left Mexico at all".

Starr explained that they appeared to have been disguised as [[wikt:diplomatic bag|diplomatic bags]], which have immunity from customs examination. Starr illustrated the differences between the shipment bag sent to the UN and a genuine UN diplomatic bag to journalists, concluding: "This did not come from a United Nations facility". According to ''{{w|The Guardian}}'', a genuine UN diplomatic bag would be of a different material and a greater size than those sent to the UN.

UN resolution on Syria vetoed by Russia and China
{{date|February 5, 2012}}
{{Syria}}
[[file:United Nations Security Council.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting chambers of the United Nations Security Council {{image|Patrick Gruban}}]]
The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] did not pass a resolution supporting {{w|Arab League}} actions pursuing peace in [[Syria]]. The resolution was {{w|United Nations Security Council veto power|vetoed}} by Council Permanent Members [[Russia]] and [[China]]. This is the second time in the past four months that a resolution to control violence in Syria has been vetoed by Russia and China.

All of the other members of the Security Council voted for the resolution. The [[Morocco|Moroccan]] Ambassador Mohammed Loulichki who sponsored the resolution said that he was "frustrated and sad" that it did not pass. [[United States]] ambassador to the UN {{w|Susan Rice}} said  "The United States stands with you, the Syrian people, and we will not rest until you and your bravery achieve your basic, universal human rights, to which all human beings are entitled. Today, we saw clearly which countries are prepared to support the people of Syria &mdash; and, indeed, the people of the entire region &mdash; as they struggle to attain a future of peace and democracy." US President [[Barack Obama]] and Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] both supported the passage of the resolution.

The resolution was intended to control a violent {{w|2011–2012 Syrian uprising|civil war}} in Syria as part of the {{w|Arab Spring}}. Since protests broke out last year, as many as 6,000 protesters and 1,000 members of the {{w|Syrian Armed Forces}} have been killed. The protesters are calling for an end of the regime of [[Bashar al-Assad]].

Lebanese-Syrian meetings reach full withdrawal accord
{{date|April 4, 2005}}

[[United Nations]] envoy Terje Roed-Larsen and [[Syria]]n Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara announced Sunday at a joint news conference that Syria will withdraw all troops and foreign intelligence agents by the April 30 deadline. The withdrawal would precede the upcoming national elections scheduled for May, and would end 25 years of Syrian military occupation in [[Lebanon]].

The news conference came after meetings in {{w|Damascus}} between Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] and the Lebanese army chief General Michel Suleiman that dealt with the withdrawal timetable. Roed-Larson said, "Syria has agreed that subject to the acceptance of the Lebanese authorities, a U.N. verification team will be dispatched to verify the [full withdrawal]."

The removal of Syrian military presence in Lebanon is a main sticking point of the anti-Syrian, or opposition group, objections towards forming a new government. After a February bombing assassination of the previous Lebanese Prime Minister {{w|Rafik Hariri}}, who was also anti-Syrian, he was succeeded by {{w|Omar Karami}}. Massive opposition group street protests forced the pro-Syrian Karami to resign, but a week later he was re-installed by President al-Assad to spear-head the new government's formation.

Mr. Karami has been unable to secure opposition group support for forming a new government. The Lebanese Parliament must act soon to form consensus in announcing new elections, or its legal mandate to do so will expire.

UK politician foresees nuclear Iran triggering new Middle Eastern cold war
{{date|February 20, 2012}}
{{Politics and conflicts}}

[[UK|British]] Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] has described a possibility of {{W|Cold war (general term)|a new cold war}} in the [[Middle East]] due to the [[Iran]]ian nuclear programme. [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] suggests negotiating with Iran by asking it to disprove the allegations of developing nuclear weapons.
[[File:William Hague 2010 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The comments were made by UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, pictured here in 2010.]]
"If [the Iranians] obtain nuclear weapons capability, then I think other nations across the Middle East will want to develop nuclear weapons," Hague said. "The most serious round of nuclear proliferation since nuclear weapons were invented would have begun." Ex-UK {{w|Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|diplomat}} Sir {{w|Richard Dalton (diplomat)|Richard Dalton}} rules out the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons.

Meanwhile Ki-moon dismissed [[US]] and [[Israel]]i suggestions of attacking Iran, saying that "all these issues should be resolved peacefully through negotiations, through dialogue." He said so after attending anniversary ceremonies of an agency to detect secret nuclear weapon tests, called the {{W|Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation}}. Hague has also urged Israel not to strike. He said, "All options must remain on the table but a military attack would have enormous downsides." He insisted on giving sanctions to Iran instead.

However, some US officials extrapolated that Iran is determined about the nuclear programme as the nation threatened to disrupt oil supply to six [[Europe]]an nations earlier this week. A number of US officials now believe that attacking Iran is the only way out.

Dalton stated, "There are many signs, as reported by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], that some research and development relevant to the development of nuclear weapons may still be going on. But it is wrong to say that Iran is rushing towards having a nuclear weapon."

Iran organised a ceremony which revealed its nuclear programme on Wednesday. It stated that the programme is only about generating nuclear power. Iran also loaded its first domestically created fuel into the reactor last week.

UNICEF: An increasing number of children are living in slums
{{date|March 5, 2012}}

{{missing image|File:Flag of UNICEF.svg|thumb|right|{{w|UNICEF}} Flag}}

{{w|UNICEF}} published a new report titled, "THE STATE OF THE WORLD’S CHILDREN 2012 — Children in an Urban World". According to the report, every third city child today lives in a {{w|slum}} and has no access to adequate food, drinking water, education and medical care.

About one billion children and adolescents, and thus half of all children and adolescents, are living in cities. The continuing {{w|urbanization}} makes the cities of the world grow annually by about 60 million people. The needs and rights of children and adolescents are, according to UNICEF, often disregarded and play no significant role in {{w|urban planning}}. In order to give children a voice in urban decision-making processes, UNICEF has worked on the ''Child-Friendly Cities Initiative''.

The report describes the effects of poverty with regard to {{w|malnutrition}}, poor {{w|hygiene}}, {{w|educational inequality}} and vulnerability; social inequality also leads to crime and violence. The {{w|infant mortality}} in poor slums is higher than in some rural areas.

Often between 50 and 80 percent of the income of a family are required for nutrition and access to existing health services; in the cities this is not possible, so diseases such as [[measles]], {{w|tuberculosis}} and other diseases avoidable by [[vaccination]] are becoming dangerously prevalent again.

On February 28, 18 countries signed an additional protocol to the {{w|UN Convention on the Rights of the Child}} that gives children the right to appeal to the [[United Nations]] if their [[human rights]] have been violated and domestic remedies have been exhausted.

China asks Syrian regime and opposition to cease fire
{{date|March 4, 2012}}
{{Syria}}
The [[People's Republic of China]] called on [[Syria]]n government forces and opposition in the [[2011–2012 Syrian uprising|Syrian uprising]], such as the {{w|Free Syrian Army}}, to end the violence. Previously, China has opposed two attempts at [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] {{w|United Nations Security Council resolution|resolutions}} to control the violence in Syria and to ask for President [[Bashar al-Assad]] to resign.

While the {{w|Arab League}}, the [[European Union]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United States]] all have pursued {{w|International sanctions|sanctions}} against the regime in Syria, China so far has been against the removal of the Syrian regime and has rejected sanctions. The former {{w|Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General}} of the United Nations [[Kofi Annan]] has been newly appointed as a Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the Arab League, which has been endorsed by the Chinese statement.

The Turkish {{w|Foreign minister|Minister of Foreign Affairs}} {{w|Ahmet Davutoğlu}} said the international community should respond to the Syrian government's actions, which he called "savagery". "The fact that aid is prevented and access is refused to United Nations officials constitutes another crime," the minister said. The [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] had been denied access to the city of [[Homs]].

China has usually hesitated to support international intervention in national situations, as when a United Nations resolution was invoked to support the bombing of [[Libya]] by [[NATO]] forces last year.

North Korea plans to launch long-range rocket
{{date|March 18, 2012}}

{{North Korea}}On Friday, [[North Korea]] announced that the country will launch a satellite mounted to a long-range rocket into orbit, as a celebratory action for late leader {{w|Kim Il Sung}}'s 100th birthday. 

[[File:Kim Il Song Portrait-2.jpg|thumb|left|{{w|Kim Il Sung}} portrait (2007) {{Image source|[[commons:User:Gilad.rom|Gilad.rom]]}}]]
The statement caused international concern as North Korea agreed to stop its nuclear program and weapon testing just 16 days earlier. In return, the [[United States]] would give 240,000 metric tons of food to the {{w|famine}}-stricken North Korea. 

The launch is scheduled to take place between April 12 through the 16. 

{{QuoteRight|Such a missile launch would pose a threat to regional security ...|4={{w|United States Department of State|U.S. State Department}}}}

"Such a missile launch would pose a threat to regional security and would also be inconsistent with North Korea’s recent undertaking to refrain from long-range missile launches," said {{w|United States Department of State|U.S. State Department}} spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland. "We call on North Korea to adhere to its international obligations, including all relevant U.N. Security Council Resolutions. We are consulting closely with our international partners on next steps."

If North Korea goes through with the launch, U.S. officials said that the food aid deal could be threatened. 

[[South Korea]] claims that the launch is a "clear violation" of [[United Nations Security Council]] resolutions. North Korea launched a similar satellite over northern Japan in 2009.  

{{w|Osamu Fujimura}}, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, stated that the country has "set up a crisis management taskforce," and is working with the U.S. and South Korea on the issue.   

"We believe a launch would be a move to interfere with our effort toward a dialogue, and we strongly urge North Korea not to carry out a satellite launch," Fujimura said. 

The U.S. and South Korean governments believe the satellite program is a disguise for long-range missile tests. The technology for launching both is similar and unrecognizable to outsiders. 

The satellite, Kwangmyongsong-3, will be launched from the northwest near [[China]]’s border, at {{w|Solace Satellite Launching Station}}. 
A North Korean spokesman said that next month’s launch is an opportunity for "putting the country's technology of space use for peaceful purposes on a higher stage."

Imminent danger of famine in the Sahel
{{date|March 18, 2012}}
[[File:Sahel_rainfall_timeseries.gif|thumb|200px|Lower levels of precipitation in the Sahel region since 1970]]
The [[U.N.]] {{w|Food and Agriculture Organization}} reports that an estimated number of sixteen million people may soon suffer from food shortages in the {{w|Sahel}} region. 
{{w|UNICEF}} prepares for a worst case scenario of providing food for 1.5 million children with acute malnutrition.

The [[U.N.]] {{w|Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs}} announced that by Tuesday the [[United Nations]] had so far only received about a quarter of the {{W|United States dollar|US$}}1 billion required for the imminent food crisis; the United Nations had appealed to the international community for donations.

The situation is further complicated by {{w|Tuareg}} {{w|Separatism|separatists}} in [[Mali]], which are a security risk to the charities and have displaced residents to other states of the Sahel, as well as by workers in [[Niger]], who have returned from [[Libya]] or [[Nigeria]], but found no occupation in Niger. The government of Niger has initiated a program for this group consisting of relief food aid and labor schemes.

"We witnessed last year the situation spiraling out of control in {{w|East Africa}} as the aid community failed to act swiftly," explained Mamadou Biteye, the regional director of {{w|Oxfam}} for {{w|West Africa}}: "The worst can be avoided and thousands of lives will be saved if we act now. It's that simple."

The last food crises were the {{w|2011 East Africa drought}} in the Horn of Africa and the {{w|2010 Sahel famine}}.

Report indicates continued severe weather problems still looming
{{date|March 30, 2012}}
{{Environment}}
A 586-page report by the {{w|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}} released Wednesday indicated governments should prepare for continued weather-related catastrophes. The report noted highly populated and very poor areas are at highest risk, and stressed no country or continent is safe from these ongoing threats. The panel consists of {{w|Nobel Prize}}-winners, whose work in {{w|climatology}} indicates more intense [[tropical cyclones]].

[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|left|The {{w|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}} was created by the [[United Nations]] in 1988. {{Image source|Wilfried Huss / Anonymous}}]]
The report placed blame regarding recent disasters on a combination of [[climate change]] caused by humans, population changes and poverty. The panel was founded in 1988 by the [[United Nations]].

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates recent severe weather conditions are costing upwards of {{w|United States dollar|US$}}80 billion per year. The report focused heavily on issues pertaining to coastal areas of the [[United States]], specifically noting damage in those areas could increase 20 percent by 2030. 

The authors of the report stated some portions of [[India]] may become uninhabitable for floods and other problems.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change pointed out other cities at lesser risk, such as: [[Miami]], [[Shanghai]], [[Bangkok]], [[China]]'s [[Guangzhou]], [[Vietnam]]'s {{w|Ho Chi Minh City}}, [[Myanmar]]'s {{w|Yangon}} (formerly known as Rangoon), and India's [[Kolkata]] (formerly known as Calcutta). Inhabitants of small {{w|island nations}} may have to leave their homes because of elevated sea levels and major storms. A total of 220 authors worked on the report.

China, UN rebuke North Korea for rocket launch
{{date|April 19, 2012}}
{{North Korea}}

[[File:UN_criticizes_North_Korea-2.ogv|left|thumb|The United Nations Security Council met behind closed doors Friday and issued tough statements right before North Korea's holiday. {{Image source|media=Video|Crtew & United Nations}}]][[File:North Korean Unha-3 rocket at launch pad.jpg|left|thumb|North Korea's Unha-3 rocket ready to launch at Tangachai-ri space center on April 8.It was launched April 13.{{Image source|Sungwon Baik / VOA}}]]<!--VOA -->[[China]] has joined other members of the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] in openly warning [[North Korea]] against future provocations and took several diplomatic measures on Tuesday and Wednesday.

<!--Channelnewsasia-->China's foreign ministry released a statement Wednesday that urged a return to talks: "We believe that maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula is in the interest of all parties ... Dialogue and negotiation is the only correct way out." 

The statement came after North Korea's announcement Tuesday that it would no longer honor the testing agreements that have been made with the [[United States]]. The United States halted its food aid, which had been part of the agreements, after Friday's failed launch.

<!--VOA-->Also on Tuesday, China delivered another stern warning to the nation through its party newspaper <i>Global Times</i>. In the statement, China expressed impatience with its neighbor and said China's foreign policy toward North Korea would not be hijacked by North Korea's leaders. <!--Channelnewsasia-->Behind the scenes, China has ceased the repatriation of North Korean nationals on Chinese territory.

<!--Fox News -->Diplomatic pressure on North Korea continued this week as the country remained defiant during its celebration Sunday. [[Kim Jong-un]] gave his first formal address on Sunday in the aftermath of Friday's failed attempt to launch a multistage rocket into orbit and in honor of the anniversary of {{w|Kim Il-sung|Kim Il-sung's}} 100th birthday. North Korea publicly acknowledged that its rocket broke up in flight and over {{w|Yellow Ocean|ocean waters}} before ever taking orbit Friday morning.

The [[United Nations]] criticized North Korea over the weekend for a satellite launch that member states saw as a "provocative" move, which followed shortly after the country's launch. UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] called the attempt "deplorable" and said it "threatens regional stability." Corinne Momal-Vanian, UN spokesperson, said, "The Secretary-General urges the (North Korean government) not to undertake any further provocative actions that will heighten tension in the region."

The UN Security Council met in a closed session Friday. {{w|Susan Rice}}, who is both the current UN Security Council president and US ambassador to the United Nations, said, "The United States' view of this is quite clear, we have condemned the launch. We view it as a direct violation of resolution 1718 and 1874. We think it’s important that the Council respond credibly and we will be working in that direction."

While China is being openly critical of North Korea, it has a veto right on the UN Security Council that has prevented further sanctions. <!--VOA -->US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] said China stood with other member nations of the Security Council in penalizing North Korea for future actions.

<!--Fox News -->In a nation where speeches by leaders are rare, the young North Korean leader on Sunday said, "Superiority in military technology is no longer monopolized by imperialists." The public event finished with the display of a new rocket and it further punctuated Kim Jong-un's call for making the military the nation's number one priority.

Supreme Court of Pakistan criticizes authorities over Bhutto murder
{{date|April 17, 2012}}

{{Pakistan}}[[Pakistan]]'s {{W|Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court}} yesterday criticised official handling of the murder of politician [[Benazir Bhutto]].

[[File:Benazir Bhutto.jpg|thumb|left|200px|{{w|Benazir Bhutto}} in 2004. {{Image source|[[commons:user:IFaqeer|IFaqeer]]}}]]
Since her death, the {{W|Pakistan People's Party}} (PPP), which she led, has gained control of the nation. A number of high-profile politicians are suspects in the killing but nobody has been convicted. Bhutto's former protocol minister {{w|Chaudhry Aslam}} petitioned the court to ensure a new First Information Report (FIR) was issued against a number of suspects, allowing them to be investigated.

{{QuoteRight|How can a sub-inspector have enough courage to probe someone at the helm of affairs?|4=Chief Justice {{w|Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry}}}}
The court approved his request and questioned the PPP's opposition to a new FIR. It also questioned Aslam's failure to approach the court earlier. Twelve suspects are named, including ex-President [[Pervez Musharraf]], Interior Minister {{W|Rehman Malik}}, ex-Intelligence Bureau director general {{W|Ijaz Shah}}, former acting Interior Minister {{W|Hamid Nawaz}} and ex-Chief Minister of [[Punjab]] {{W|Pervaiz Elahi}}.

The court further asked all suspects to relinquish positions of authority. "How can a sub-inspector have enough courage to probe someone at the helm of affairs?" asked Chief Justice {{w|Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry}}, sitting on a bench of three alongside Justice {{w|Tariq Parvez}} and Justice {{w|Khilji Arif Hussain}}. They said a fair investigation could not be carried out as long as suspects were in power.

The court also had questions concerning a report into the murder compiled by the [[United Nations]]: "Why did the government not publish the UN Commission report on which {{W|Pakistani rupee|Rs}}60 million of the taxpayers' money was spent? Why have no steps been taken in the light of the report? Why was the murder of an internationally acclaimed leader not been taken up in the assemblies and relevant parliamentary forums?"

Interior Minister Malik, named on the new FIR, and {{W|Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi}}, another PPP minister, had opposed another FIR. Malik had claimed it was needless as other suspects had been charged. The court rejected this, saying the implication was the case should therefore cease to be heard. Malik's lawyer sought a week to for his client to lodge a reply, to which Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry retorted "You want to create obstacles in the proceedings? How much longer do you want to linger?", adding Malik should appear in person before the court.

The Benazir Bhutto case is back before the Supreme Court on April 24.

Mexico and world react to murdered journalists
{{date|May 9, 2012}}

{{Human rights}}

[[File:Journalists Killed in Past Year Remembered on World Press Freedom Day 2012.jpg|left|thumb|UN Secretary General leads a moment of silence on World Press Freedom Day 2012.{{Image source|UN Photo/Eskinder Debebe}}]]
[[File:UN World Press Freedom Day 2012.ogv|left|thumb|The United Nations honored the 74 journalists killed since 2011.{{Image source|media=Video|United Nations, UNTV}}]]<!-- See Herald Tribune source -->This past weekend, over 100 journalists in [[Mexico City]] protested around a statue where a mock note said in translation, "Government Journalist Killer" in reaction to deaths in {{w|Veracruz}}. Recent journalist killings have also provoked international condemnation.

<!-- See CNN source -->Earlier {{w|Governor of Veracruz|Javier Duarte de Ochoa}}, governor of Veracruz, said Friday he would create a state-led organization to protect journalists after recent violence against journalists, including the discovery of dead photojournalists. 

<!-- See May 3 sources -->Journalists around the [[Mexico|nation]] and the government of Veracruz are reacting to the dismembered bodies of four [[Mexico|Mexicans]], three of them photojournalists, who were found in a canal in the state of {{w|Veracruz}}, Mexico, on Thursday, which happened to coincide with {{w|World Press Freedom Day}}, which is held on May 3 every year. 

<!--See the New York Times. I was looking for a source that included 4 bodies like the Mexican sources from Veracruz and the NYTimes was the first one with that info out in the English press that I could find.-->Two of the photographers worked for ''Notiver'' and later ''VeracruzNews''. They were identified as Gabriel Huge and Guillermo Luna. The body of Luna's girlfriend Irasema Becerra was also found. The other photographer, Esteban Rodríguez, had worked as a videographer for {{w|TV Azteca}} before working for ''Diario AZ''.

<!--See the CPJ website "CPJ condemns murder of Mexican photographers" found in External Links for this statement. -->The {{w|Committee to Protect Journalists}} released the following statement in condemning the death of the three photographers: "We are deeply troubled by reports of these murders that, coming as they do on World Press Freedom Day underscore the ongoing crisis in Mexico. Veracruz has seen a wave of lethal anti-press violence that is sowing widespread fear and self-censorship. Mexican authorities must act now to end the deadly cycle of impunity in crimes against the press."

<!-- See UNESCO source -->Irina Bokova, who is the director-general of UNESCO, said, "That these gruesome crimes have been committed on the eve of World Press Freedom Day – a day on which we honour the vital role played by journalists in upholding democratic values, protecting citizens’ rights to be informed and calling those in power to account – makes the situation all the more intolerable...I condemn these three murders in the strongest possible terms and urge the Mexican authorities to act quickly and decisively to find those responsible. Impunity is not an option."

<!--See the Houston Chronicle-->On the Saturday before the deaths, the body of ''Proceso'' journalist Regina Martinez was found in her {{w|Xalapa}} apartment. Martinez had been investigating other journalists who had been killed in the state of Veracruz. <!--See the CPJ website for this background. The Houston Chronicle has made a factual error in its article. Not seven but eight journalists have been killed. I suspect they had not counted Miseal López Solana who is lumped in with more famous father, but they both were killed on the same day. You can do the count yourself. See talk page. -->The three bodies of photographers and Regina Martinez bring to eight the number of journalists killed in Veracruz in the past year and a half. 

<!--CPJ has a page on each one to confirm the information. -->Four journalists died in Veracruz in 2011. The long-time crime journalist for ''Notiver'', {{w|Miguel Ángel López Velasco}}, better known by his pseudonym Milo Vera, was killed along with his wife and son. López's son Miseal López Solana was a crime photographer at ''Notiver'' who often worked with his father. About one month after their death, the body of their colleague and friend at ''Notiver'' {{w|Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz|Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz}} was found decaptitated with a note at the crime scene. She was investigating the López's murder at the time. Earlier in 2011, Noel López Olguín of the ''La Verdad de Jáltipan'' was murdered.

<!--See the RSF article -->In March 2012, the Mexican Congress approved a Constitutional amendment to make it a federal offense to attack a journalist and that would need six more states to sign on before it would become the law. <!--See the RSF article ... "Two reporters..."--> Over the last ten years, the toll of the {{w|Mexican Drug War}} has been high on journalists as more than 80 have been killed and another fourteen are missing, according to [[Reporters Without Borders]]. Almost 50,000 people have died during Mexican President [[Felipe Calderón]]'s drug war.

<!--See the May 4 AP story -->The {{w|drug cartel}} known as the {{w|Zetas}} are active in Veracruz. However, a cartel that is closely allied with the {{w|Sinaloa}} cartel headed by {{w|Joaquín Guzmán Loera|Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán}} and is based out of {{w|Jalisco}} is at war with the Zetas over territory. Both of the competing cartels have been pressuring journalists in Veracruz to cover only its side of the story.

Mike O'Connor, a spokesperson for CPJ on Mexico, said, "It's hard to imagine what else reporters can do to stay safe there."

<!-- See the RFL/RE citation -->In other news on World Press Freedom Day, {{w|UNESCO}} presented {{w|Azerbaijani|Azerbaijan}} journalist {{w|Eynulla Fatullayev}} with its Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize at a conference on press freedom in [[Tunisia]]. He spent four years in prison for his journalism.

<!-- See the Talk Page link to the UN News site.-->In New York, [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] led a moment of silence to honor the 74 journalists who died since 2011, of which fourteen have already died this year. This figure does not include the most recent discovery of Mexican journalists.

Cyprus leader says no to second term
{{date|May 14, 2012}}

[[File:Dimitris Christofias.jpg|left|thumb|Greek Cyprus President Demetris Christofias started his first term in 2008.]]{{W|President of Cyprus|Cypriot President}} {{w|Demetris Christofias}} announced today he will not run for a second term to represent the [[Republic of Cyprus]], which is the Greek portion of the island. 

The president cited the lack of progress in talks with the {{W|Northern Cyprus|Turks}} over the {{W|Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish-Greek Cypriot}} conflict as his main reason for stepping aside. In a televised national address, Christofias said, "A realistic analysis of the facts leads to the conclusion that there are no real hopes for either resolving the Cyprus issue or achieving substantial progress in the remaining months of my presidency."

The [[United Nations]] had recently pulled out of hosting talks between the two parties because of the lack of progress.

Christofias said, "Taking as a fact that the Cyprus problem has not been solved and there does not appear to be definitive progress in the next few months ... I will not seek re-election as president of the Republic of Cyprus."

Christofias is making good on a campaign promise that if he was not able to make progress on resolving the conflict that he would step aside. The issue on UN reunification talks with the Turks divided Christofias and former president {{w|Tassos Papadopoulos}} in the 2008 election. 

Every president of the Republic since independence in 1960 has sought a second term of office.

The island of Cyprus has been divided into two sectors since a coup by [[Greece|Greek]] unionists in 1974 was followed in response by a [[Turkey|Turkish]] military invasion.

UN convoy targeted in Syrian province of Idlib
{{date|May 15, 2012}}
{{Syria}}

[[File:UN convoy attack 15 05 2012.ogv|thumb|left|Syrian activists uploaded this video of the attack on the UN convoy to YouTube. {{Image source|media=Video|mahned1000}}]]The [[United Nations]] has confirmed that its convoy in [[Syria]] was bombed this afternoon while a human rights group reported a Syrian military attack on civilians at a nearby funeral in the Syrian town of {{w|Khan Shaykhun|Khan Sheikhoun}} in {{w|Idlib Governorate|Idlib province}} today.

Just prior to the bombing of the UN convoy at around 1400 Eastern European Time (UTC+2), the Syrian military is said to have attacked a funeral procession and reportedly 20 people were killed in that incident. The attack on civilians by the Syrian military was reported by the {{w|Syrian Observatory for Human Rights}}.

According to Martin Nesirky, who is the UN spokesperson for Secretary-General {{w|Ban Ki-moon}}, an IED bomb struck its four-vehicle convoy. UN personnel had to be left behind after the blast but no UN staff were injured. Later, the UN sent a patrol to pick up personnel left behind. Three UN marked vehicles were damaged.

A video uploaded to the video sharing website [[YouTube]] reportedly shows the UN convoy being targeted and bombed.

About a dozen civilians can be seen surrounding the lead car of the convoy talking to UN observers. Some civilians can be heard screaming. Several seconds later, a bomb explodes near what appears to be the lead car of the convoy severely damaging the front end of the vehicle and injuring several civilians. The lead car, still operating, begins to leave the area. The two other vehicles follow. According to reports, several civilians were injured and or killed in the attack. The UN has reportedly stated that none of their observers were injured. 

"We went to observe and after a while shooting occurred"; "We are safe with the {{w|Free Syrian Army|Free Army}} and we are waiting for a [U.N.] group to pick us up," said UN observers to {{w|Reuters}}. According to reports, the UN is seeking "to remove the observers from the area."

It is not yet known who was responsible for the attack on the UN convoy.

Over 900 people dead, 14,000 infected in Haitian cholera outbreak
{{Haiti}}
{{date|November 14, 2010}}
[[File:Vibrio cholerae.jpg|thumb|left|Vibrio cholerae {{image|Dartmouth Electron Microscope Facility}}]]
New figures show an estimated 917 have died and 14,000 more {{w|2010 Haiti cholera outbreak|infected with cholera}} in [[Haiti]]'s present outbreak. However, it is suspected that many deaths in mountainous regions far from hospitals are going unreported.  

Clinics are rapidly filling up and many deaths are being reported. "The trend is extremely, extremely alarming. We have not reached a peak yet, but it could arrive next week," said the head of mission for {{w|Medecins Sans Frontieres}}, Stefano Zannini. A health official described the situation in {{w|Port-Au-Prince}} as "[growing] more pathetic each day." The official also said that hospitals in the capital are not able to cope with all of the patients. 

The [[United Nations]] has appealed to donor nations for {{w|United States Dollars|US$}}164 million in order to import more doctors, medicine, and water purification systems. 

According to the US {{w|Centers for Disease Control}} (CDC) "experience from the [[Peru]] outbreak in the early 1990s and from other countries in Latin America suggests that we should expect to identify additional cases for many months to several years." 

CDC says cholera is "an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium ''Vibrio cholerae''. The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but sometimes it can be severe... In severe cases, the infected person may experience profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours."

{{quote|No one alive in [[Haiti]] has experienced cholera before, so it is a population which is very susceptible to the bacteria. Cholera, now that it is in Haiti, probably the bacteria will be there for a number of years to come. It will not go away.—World Health Organization spokesman Gregory Hartl}}

UN's Convention on Domestic Workers expected to take effect in 2013
 <!-- Leave review, or other templates, up here -->
{{date|September 9, 2012}}
[[Image:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|150px|thumb|Emblem of the {{w|United Nations}} {{image|Spiff}}|left]]
{{Uruguay}}

The {{w|Convention on Domestic Workers}} (also known as the [[ILO]] Convention 189) is to take effect next year after the [[Philippines]] ratified it earlier this month, according to the United Nations. It follows the lead taken by {{w|Uruguay}} which ratified it earlier this year. Only two countries are needed in order for it to take effect.

Upon taking effect, the convention is intended to protect the rights of around 53 to 100 million {{w|domestic workers}} around the world. Based on UN estimates, many of them are {{w|women}} and {{w|migrant workers}}. The ILO has noted that these workers work in a sector that lacks regulation and is informal. 

According to the UN, the convention intends to grant the workers several rights. These include {{w|freedom of association}} and {{w|collective bargaining}}, protection from {{w|child labor}}, {{w|forced labor}}, and {{w|discrimination}}. Also included are chapters that entitles domestic workers to a {{w|contract}} that specifies the type of work, {{w|salary}}, the {{w|hours of work}}, {{w|paid leave}}, and days off.

Israel sets 36 hour ultimatum for Hamas
{{date|November 20, 2012}}
{{Israel}}

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - IDF Forces in Staging Areas Around Gaza Strip2-1.jpg|thumbnail|left|IDF forces stage around Gaza {{Image credit|[[Israel Defence Force]]}}]]

[[Israel]] warned [[Hamas]] yesterday to cease rocket fire and threatened a widening offensive if Hamas continues. Hamas maintains Israel "is the aggressor." <!--RT 8th paragraph-->

The ultimatum comes after Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] stated the [[Israel Defence Force]] (IDF) was "prepared for a significant expansion of the operation"<!-- RT 14th paragraph--> and after 75,000 army reservists were drafted for duty.<!-- bhaskar.com last paragraph -->

"We are at a junction. Either we go toward a calm or toward a meaningful widening of the operation… including a possible move to achieve complete military decision", said Israeli Finance Minister {{w|Yuval Steinitz}} to IDF Radio.<!-- RT 3rd paragraph -->

[[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] is in the region meeting with the {{w|Arab Leauge}} in an attempt to negotiate a {{w|ceasefire}} between Israel and Gaza. There has been some optimism as Netanyahu met with his cabinet members to discuss a phased ceasefire agreement.

Israel has led an air campaign targeting high ranking Hamas commanders, rocket launcher locations, and Hamas communication sites, but has come under scrutiny with the rising number of civilian deaths in Gaza.

Philippines seeks United Nations arbitration on South China Sea claims
{{date|January 23, 2013}}
{{Philippines}}

The [[Philippines]] said yesterday it will take [[China]] to an {{w|arbitration}} tribunal under the [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Convention on the Law of the Sea}} (UNCLOS) on a series of territorial disputes involving the [[South China Sea]].

According to Philippine {{w|Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Foreign Affairs Secretary}} {{w|Albert del Rosario}}, [[Manila]] chose this move after exhausting "almost all political and diplomatic avenues." He also says he has already informed the Chinese ambassador in Manila.

Disputes such as those involving the {{w|Scarborough Shoal}} and China's {{w|Nine-dotted line}} map are likely to be tackled. The Philippines has stated the map issued by China is unlawful under UNCLOS, which includes both countries as signatories.

The Philippines and China are involved in a variety of disputes in the South China Sea along with [[Taiwan]] and [[ASEAN]] members [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]]. The current chair of ASEAN, Brunei, has stated it seeks a legally-binding "code of conduct" for the disputes.

UN adds to criticism of Australian offshore centers
{{date|February 5, 2013}}
{{Australian news}}

{{missing image|File:UNHCR.svg|left|thumb|The {{w|UNHCR}} has twice won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.}}<!-- Source below: VOA -->The {{w|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}} (UNHCR) echoed criticism from other human rights groups yesterday as its new report called on [[Australia]] to cease the {{w|Mandatory detention in Australia|practice}} of holding {{w|Right of asylum|asylum seekers}} in an uncertain status in its offshore facilities.

<!-- Source below: VOA -->The UNHCR spent three days in January at an Australian facility located on {{w|Manus Island}}, [[Papua New Guinea]]. Following Australian mandatory policy, the more than two hundred detainees held there were detained upon requesting asylum. More than 30 children are being held at this Australian facility. The UNHCR report raised the crowded conditions at the camp as a cause for concern, as well as the impact isolation could have on the children. Australia has another facility for asylum seekers on the island of [[Nauru]]. The UNHCR report made clear Australia does not have a process for clearing the asylum seekers, which means their detention in the camps is indefinite and a violation of {{w|Universal Declaration of Human Rights|international human rights}}. 

<!-- Source below: Canberra Times -->Caught in the middle of the debate is the new immigration minister {{w|Brendan O'Connor (politician)|Brendan O'Connor}}. O'Connor was named immigration minister this weekend. The following night, a boat load of 60 refugees who were approached near {{w|Christmas Island}} sought asylum. <!-- Source below: VOA -->Monday, the UNHCR issued its report. <!-- Source below: The Australian -->Union leaders, amongst them Brendan's brother Michael O'Connor who is national secretary of the {{w|Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union}}, are calling for and end to current migration deals.

<!-- Source below: Herald Sun -->A report from {{w|Monash University}} found immigrants have taken 200,000 jobs created during the last two years, depressing employment of young, lower skilled Australians. Polls show a 70 percent majority of Australians stand opposed to the growth in population that will result from immigration.

<!-- Source below: Amnesty International -->[[Amnesty International]] points out that those migrants held in offshore processing facilities are not typical immigrants but rather asylum seekers. It says the latter category accounts for only three percent of Australia's influx from immigration. Moreover, Amnesty International says the practice of offshore facilities for asylum seekers runs afoul of Australia's own international agreements, such as the {{w|Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|UN Refugee Convention}}, and laws, {{w|Mandatory detention in Australia|Australian Migration Act 1958}}. 

<!-- See August source -->In August, Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] indicated in talks with Nauru and Papua New Guinea that Australia was interested in quickly processing the asylum seekers.

Campaigning ends in landmark Congo elections
{{date|July 29, 2006}}
[[Image:Cg-map.png|right|200px|Map of the Democratic Republc of Congo]]
The month long election campaign in the run up to this weekend's elections in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] has ended, with a one day break before voting can begin Sunday.

The fiercely fought campaign began on June 29th and involved no less than 9,707 parliamentary candidates and 33 presidential candidates. Canvassing ended yesterday with a mass rally in support of the current president {{w|Joseph Kabila}}. 

Kabila, who became the youngest head of state in Africa in 2001, used his final speech before voting to claim credit for taking the D.R. Congo to its first democratic elections in over 40 years. "I can say to you without false modesty: mission accomplished" he told crowds of around 50,000 on Friday, "We've reunited and pacified the country. It is also a message of hope, and for peace and development and security after the polls."

The international community is taking a keen interest in the elections &mdash; the first since 1961. However, the July campaign has been marred by violence and accusations of fraud on all sides. 

International observers, such as the {{w|Carter Centre}}, expressed concern that the incumbent President's domination of the media would undermine the campaign. Several hundred people protested at alleged irregularities in the polls on the 18th of July, which ended in 7 people being killed in police clashes. One candidate has also fled to [[Uganda]] after violence. 

This Thursday, 6 people were killed in election related incidents in the capital, {{w|Kinshasa}}, and yesterday, Kabila's presidential guards killed an opposition candidate's bodyguard in a gunfight. 

The [[U.N.]] has deployed its largest ever peacekeeping force &mdash; 17,000 &mdash; to monitor the elections, costing over $460 million. Despite troubles, the deputy U.N. representative in the country, Ross Mountain, said the Democratic Republic is ready for tomorrow's polls. 

50,000 polling stations have been set up around the country, for the 25.6 million voters, with over 60,000 Congolese police and 1,700 international observers in place to monitor voting.

Canupa Gluha Mani speaks about Lakota Oyate, Lakota freedom
{{date|January 9, 2008}}

It's now been three weeks since the four-person {{w|Republic of Lakotah|Lakota Freedom Delegation}} declared that the {{w|Lakota people}} were withdrawing from their treaties with the [[United States]] and, though small, the movement still proves controversial: two U.S.-recognized Lakota tribal governments have rejected the Delegation's authority outright with at least one tribe stating it will consider the Delegation's, now Lakota Oyate's, proposal. The rest of the tribes have remained silent.

The central figure the movement has been Canupa Gluha Mani, a longtime activist whose tactics have led repeatedly to his arrest and imprisonment — most recently in June 2007, when Canupa Gluha Mani was one of six arrested who participated in blockading a road in [[Nebraska]] to keep outside alcohol from entering his {{w|Dry county|dry reservation}} where it is banned. ''[[Wikinews]]'' talked to Canupa Gluha Mani about the movement and Lakota Oyate in an exclusive interview.

{{missing image|Image:Canupa Gluha Mani sings.jpg|thumb|Canupa Gluha Mani (left) at the Lakota Freedom Delegation's December press conference in Washington. Russell Means is in the background. {{image credit|Naomi Archer}}}}
Also called Duane Martin Sr, Canupa Gluha Mani prefers to be referred to as just that, "Canupa Gluha Mani"; it means "He walks as he protects the pipe", though much of the meaning is lost in translation between English and the delicately-nuanced Lakota language. Canupa Gluha Mani prefers to speak in this, his native tongue &mdash; he "hates" that the English language has become the everyday language of the Lakota, and decries the extinction of many indigenous American languages &mdash; but uses English fluently and earthily.

Canupa Gluha Mani talked about the Cante Tenza, the Strong Heart Warrior Society, which he heads and which forms the paramilitary force of Lakotah. The society, an ''okolakiciye'' or warrior society, originated in the {{w|Black Hills}}. He told the following story: Four warriors in the hills ran across a {{w|coyote}} and gave it chase. And as the coyote ran he turned into a Lakota man, and in his changing the man left four objects: a rattle, a drum, a lance, and a {{w|tomahawk}} with which the Lakota people could be defended. Canupa Gluha Mani is a warrior leader, and his position with relation to the treaty council which traditionally governs the Lakota is "whip-man", loosely "sergeant at arms" &mdash; that is, he enforces order and decorum when passions grow heated during tribal discussions.

The authority of the Lakota Freedom Delegation, he says, comes not from the {{w|Bureau of Indian Affairs|BIA}}-recognized governments but rather from the "people who understand treaties", i.e. the treaty council, from among the Seven Sister Bands of the Lakota. This traditional government is based on the idea of "staying quiet and listening to the people who have answers", the "itacans" or expert headmen.

Canupa Gluha Mani also endorsed Naomi Archer, who has acted as Lakota Oyate's liaison; indeed, as the Lakota Freedom Delegation prepared its trip to Washington DC he called in Naomi Archer, who though of non-native extraction is his adopted sister and a fellow Cante Tenza member, to handle media support. "I support the understandings of what she's saying", he said, referring to a previous interview with Archer which revealed an apparent split between {{w|Russell Means}} and other members of the Lakota Freedom Delegation. "She as an individual has integrity." However, the previous interview missed nuances and the perceived gap between Lakota Oyate and Russell Means' Republic of Lakota is not so great. "There's no division here....it's communication, that's all. We can always get past this."

With regard to Russell Means, who has declared himself Chief Facilitator of the {{w|Republic of Lakotah}}, he said, "I've worked with my uncle Russell Means in positive venues. And I'm still behind him, I have love for him;" He emphasized the familial bond between himelf and Means, noting that Means had adopted him as a nephew. However, "the Lakota have to be recognized." It was "genocide", he said, that of all the races of humanity, American Indians are not represented at the [[United Nations]].

On the subject of Lakota activist Alfred Bone Shirt, who organized the Lakota Oyate's first freedom celebration and information meeting on Saturday, 5 January but has since made comments attacking the legitimacy of Canupa Gluha Mani, Naomi Archer and Lakota Oyate, Canupa Gluha Mani had this to say. "I have nothing to do with Mr Bone Shirt, nothing against him". He also noted that Lakota Oyate had respected Bone Shirt's call to take down invitations for donations, but expressed a wish that Mr Bone Shirt would make the same call to any other website inviting donations to Lakotah.

The traditional decision making process within the Lakota, he said, was informal discussions among the women of the Lakota rather than pronouncements and declarations. Ideas like western forms of government &mdash; referencing the "Republic" &mdash; and the use of the English language were part of the reason for both the misunderstanding of the dispute between Russell Means and Canupa Gluha Mani and the Lakota's problems:  "It's hard for Indian people to adapt to this modern lifestyle....It's white teaching that cause Indian problem....leave us alone....This country has not learned a thing about its own First Nations people."

US governing of Lakota has led directly to the economic and social decline of the Lakotah people, he argues. Canupa Gluha Mani noted that the life expectancy for Lakota men is only 44, and that alcohol and drug use are epidemic, as are infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. But revival of the Lakota has to be not just economic to improve the circumstances of the people, but cultural too: "Our language is at stake right now" but the US government-backed institutions like the Tribal Police are just "the second coming of the white man's cavalry".

Canupa Gluha Mani is on record as saying in a previous interview that "we'll probably get killed for" withdrawing from the United States. Now, he is tight-lipped on the future, and when asked about the possibility of a confrontation with the US will only say that "anything's plausible." 

And if the United States government leaves the Lakota alone? "Then we can take our practices forward in good will." Canupa Gluha Mani, who is married to a woman of European descent, says that the traditional American Indian lifestyle can coexist with the western lifestyle, but "every wound has to heal". "We can be self-sufficient. We can govern ourselves." Having withdrawn from the outstanding treaties with the United States, will Lakota Oyate make a new arrangement with Washington? "That has yet to be exonerated." Lakotah continues to seek international recognition; although no country has declared recognition for Lakotah, he is "confident with the [[Bolivia]]ns" and also noted a positive response from the "[[Bulgaria]]n freedom fighters" pressuring the US to recognize Lakota independence.

Canupa Gluha Mani then addressed the Lakota people directly. "What needs to get out there is, I love my people....This is your dream come true. That's what the symbolic meaning of Lakotah is. It's called freedom. ''Hoka hay.''"

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: close Guantanamo Bay
{{date|April 7, 2013}}
{{United Nations}}
[[File:Navanethem Pillay.jpg|thumb|left|Navi Pillay in 2009 {{Image|Antônio Cruz (Agência Brasil)}}]]
{{w|Navi Pillay}}, the [[United Nations]] {{w|High Commissioner for Human Rights}}, told the [[United States]] Friday to close its prison camp at [[Guantanamo Bay]] in [[Cuba]]. She argued the continuing indefinite detention without trial violates {{w|international law}}.

"We must be clear about this: the United States is in clear breach not just of its own commitments but also of international laws and standards that it is obliged to uphold", Pillay stated.

Pillay said those held in Guantanamo Bay should face a civilian trial rather than a {{w|Military tribunals in the United States|military tribunal}}, as the latter "do not meet international fair trial standards". The US has only criminally charged or convicted nine current detainees.

[[File:Camp x-ray detainees.jpg|thumb|left|Detainees arriving at Camp X-Ray, the forerunner to the current detainment regime, in January 2002. {{Image|Shane T. McCoy, U.S. Navy}}]]
The Guantanamo Bay camp was opened in January 2002 by former US President [[George W. Bush]] and currently holds 166 detainees. As of last month, 31 of the detainees were on hunger strike and eleven were being force fed, according to a {{w|US Department of Defense}} (DoD) spokesperson. Of the hunger strikers, Pillay said: "given the uncertainty and anxieties surrounding their prolonged and apparently indefinite detention in Guantanamo, it is scarcely surprising that people's frustrations boil over and they resort to such desperate measures".

President [[Barack Obama]] pledged to close Guantanamo Bay but has thus far failed to do so. The US has cleared transfer of around half of the remaining Guantanamo Bay detainees to their home country or to a third country. Pillay urged those transfers to be acted on: "As a first step, those who have been cleared for release must be released."

Responding to the statement by Pillay, Lieutenant Colonel Todd Breasseale, a DoD spokesman, defended the camp in a statement to {{w|Reuters}}: "We continue to hold detainees under the internationally recognized Law of War and in keeping with the best of our core values, safeguarding and humanely treating all who are in our care and custody, there. Assertions that present some alternate narrative simply do not withstand intellectual rigor".

South Korean president responds to North Korea's nuclear constitution change
{{North Korea}}
{{date|April 1, 2013}}

[[North Korea]]'s ruling party yesterday unveiled a plan to sign its right to build a {{W|nuclear bomb}} into its {{W|constitution}}. [[South Korea]]'s President {{w|Park Geun-Hye}} responded by saying that provocations from North Korea would trigger decisive military action as the war-like rhetoric on the peninsula intensifies. 

North Korea's declaration that it is pursuing to enshrine its right to make nuclear weapons in its {{W|Constitution of North Korea|constitution}} was coupled with a message that strengthening its economy was a priority. This is perceived by some experts as an effort by North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]] to temper the tensions.

"I believe that we should make a strong and immediate retaliation without any other political considerations if (the North) stages any provocation against our people", the South Korean president said at a meeting with military officials and Defence Minister {{W|Kim Kwan-jin}} earlier today, while reaffirming she was taking North Korea's threats very seriously. The Defence Minister did not rule out pre-emptive strikes against the North's nuclear and missile installations if need be.

The [[United States]] responded by sending {{W|stealth fighters}} to South Korea to take part in military drills.

North Korea, whose {{W|Supreme People's Assembly|parliament}} is scheduled to hold its annual parliamentary session later today, had issued a series of threats over the past months, including a declaration over the weekend that it was entering a "state of war" with the South. The tension escalated following Pyongyang's suspected ballistic missile test in December and a nuclear test in February. The [[United Nations]] imposed fresh sanctions following these moves, much to the North's irritation.

"There was a danger that this was getting to the point ... of a permanent war footing," John Delury, an analyst at [[Seoul]]'s {{W|Yonsei University}} specialising in North Korea, told the [[Associated Press]]. "In the midst of this tension and militant rhetoric and posturing, Kim Jong Un is saying, Look, we're still focused on the economy, but we're doing it with our nuclear deterrent intact."

South Korea's Foreign Minister {{W|Yun Byung-se}} is expected to meet {{W|United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State}} {{W|John Kerry}} this week in [[Washington DC|Washington]] to discuss the situation on the Korean Peninsula, {{W|Yonhap}} news agency reported.

Wikinews interviews Amir Abbas Fakhravar about Iranian nuclear intentions
{{date|April 9, 2013}}{{Iran}}
{{missing image|File:Amir Philly 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px| A file photo of {{w|Amir Abbas Fakhravar}}. {{image source|Amir Abbas Fakhravar}}}}
[[Iran]] has been operating a nuclear program for years and announced opening a new uranium facility on Tuesday. Its claims over nuclear enrichment are for a [[nuclear power]] program, although this requires 5% enrichment as opposed to the 20% enrichment level they claim the right to pursue which is more commonly used in [[nuclear bombs]].

''Wikinews'' interviewed {{w|Amir Abbas Fakhravar}}, the President of the Iranian Freedom Institute which is based in [[Washington DC]], [[United States]], also a research fellow at the {{w|The Institute of World Politics}}, about the {{w|Nuclear program of Iran|Iranian nuclear program}} in light of recent talks with this week with the {{w|P5+1}} group of countries.

{{WNIQ|Wikinews}} What is your role at the Iranian Freedom Institute?
::'''Amir Abbas Fakhravar''': I am the President and Founder of the Iranian Freedom Institute.

{{WNIQ}} Iran seems unwilling to give up its nuclear programme, do you think they will eventually given the UN [<nowiki/>[[United Nations]]<nowiki/>] sanctions?
::'''AAF''': The only way Islamic Regime in Iran will give up its nuclear program is either full operation and military attack by the West or total oil sanctions. 85&ndash;90% of the the Islamic Republic’s money comes from {{w|crude oil}} sales. This money does not go to the Iranian people, but instead funds the nuclear program, the {{w|Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Revolutionary Guards}}, {{w|basij|basijis}}, [[Hezbollah]], and other terror operations worldwide.  The Islamic Republic will be forced into abandoning its nuclear program when oil sanctions dry up the money supply.

[[File:Arak Heavy Water4.JPG|thumb|left|320px| The {{w|Nuclear facilities in Iran|Arak}} {{w|heavy water reactor}} nuclear facility in {{w|Arak, Iran|Arak}}, Iran. {{image source|Nanking2012}}.]]

{{WNIQ}} Do you feel the Islamic Republic of Iran is trying to provoke a response from the Western nations (USA, [[UK]], [[France]], [[Germany]])?
::'''AAF''': A limited military response from the West which will not be for a regime change would be a gift to the Islamic Republic, and would feed the narrative of “overreaching, imperialistic  Western governments” perpetuated by the regime.  The IR is well aware of the rapid decline in support from the Iranian people and is looking for a way to gain back some of that support, even superficially.  An attack from the west would buoy the regime and damage the work being done by the opposition.

{{WNIQ}} What is the need for Iran to have a nuclear programme, are they doing it for energy or for weapons?
::'''AAF''': Iran makes clear its intentions for the nuclear program through its actions. The regime expresses desire to annihilate [[Israel]] almost daily, and has repeatedly refused negotiation and inspection of its nuclear sites. Also you can find several type of energies in Iran and at all they don't need to have this expensive and dangerous nuclear energy. For sure Islamic republic of Iran wants to have Nuclear bomb.

{{WNIQ}} If Iran does not listen and change course with regards to its nuclear program, do you think that the United Nations will apply more sanctions?
::'''AAF''': It took a very long time to sanction the Islamic Republic to the extent it is now, and since the UN continues to send negotiators to the table to discuss Iran’s nuclear program, tighter sanctions at this point in time are unlikely. It is our responsibility at Iranian opposition to inform United Nations about this regime's threat to international community. We should move much more organize[d] and faster to cut Islamic Republic's diplomatic relationship with the world. Our campaign on oil sanctions showed us it is possible.

{{WNIQ}} Do you think that the United States is particularly unhappy and international relations are poor considering that Iran recently captured a drone and refused to return it?
::'''AAF''': While a failure militarily and with regard to foreign policy, the captured drone incident is a relatively small event in the context of ongoing tensions between the United States and the Islamic Republic.

North Korea's rising tensions: Wikinews interviews Scott Snyder and Dr Robert Kelly
{{date|April 4, 2013}}
{{North Korea}}
In recent days, [[North Korea]] has been issuing threats of war to neighbouring [[South Korea]] and the [[United States]]. There has been an increase in tensions as well as the decision to close off the {{w|Kaesong Industrial Park}} to South Korean workers.

''Wikinews'' interviewed Dr. Robert Kelly of {{w|Pusan National University}} (PNU) in South Korea, who specialises in security and diplomacy, about the recent threats; and Scott Snyder, a North Korean specialist from the {{w|Council on Foreign Relations}} (CFR) in the United States.

{{WNIQ|Wikinews}} What is your job role? 
::'''Dr. Robert Kelly''':  I am a Professor of International Relations at PNU.

::'''Scott Snyder''': I am a senior fellow for Korea Studies and director of the program for U.S.&ndash;Korea policy at CFR.

{{WNIQ}} North Korea has issued many threats to South Korea, how likely do you think it is that they will carry out these threats?
::'''RK''': Very unlikely. North Korea would lose a war if one began, and if they use [[nuclear weapons]], they will lose all sympathy in global opinion and China will abandon them. The point of these threats is to shake-down SK [South Korea] and its new president for aid, not to start a war.
{{missing image|File:Scott Snyder.jpg|thumb|left|File photo of Scott Snyder.  {{image|{{w|Council of Foreign Relations}}}}}}
::'''SS''': North Korea's threats have a variety of purposes. Some are defensive and are primarily meant to deter other countries from taking aggressive stances in the face of North Korea's own weakness; some are designed tactically to set up for negotiations; some are expressions of intent or aspiration that are beyond the capability of North Korea to implement without facing severe consequences, and some are very specific threats that North Korea will attempt to implement as part of a {{wikt|guerrilla}} strategy so as to avoid escalation and take advantage of the element of surprise.  NK [North Korean] threats should be taken seriously, but evaluated carefully to determine circumstances under which they might actually be carried out.

{{WNIQ}} How do people in South Korea feel about North Korea's nuclear weapon's programme?
::'''RK''': They do not like it of course, but they worry far less about it than outsiders would expect. South Koreans have been living under this shadow for many years. The North has made many threats in the past. So NK is like the boy who cried wolf. No one expects them to launch a weapon.

::'''SS''': Increasingly unsettled and concerned, especially about the possibility of being subject to nuclear blackmail.  At the same time, this circumstance thus far has had negligible impact on South Koreans' daily lives.

{{WNIQ}} Are South Korean citizens carrying on their day to day lives as normal?
::'''RK''': Yes, they are. This is not like the {{w|Cuban Missile Crisis}} when people were emptying the store shelves and building bunkers in their basements. My students are coming and going like normal. Indeed, South Koreans' composure is very impressive.

::'''SS''': Yes.

{{WNIQ}} Is North Korea becoming further isolated in the world?
::'''RK''': Yes, it is. Threatening nuclear war is a genuine escalation that would alienate any state. Importantly though, NK is already fairly isolated. And because China, its main aid supplier, does not cut it off, further isolation has few practical impacts.

::'''SS''': North Korea is increasingly politically isolated but it is comparatively more economically and informationally connected than it was a decade ago.

{{WNIQ}}  Is the South Korean military well-prepared to deal with any conflicts with the North Korean military?
::'''RK''': Yes. The {{w|Republic of Korea Army|ROKA}} [Republic of Korea Army, of South Korea] is a modern, well-trained, well-groomed force with substantial technical and organization superiority over the {{w|Korean People's Army|KPA}} [Korean People's Army, of North Korea]. To date, the South Koreans have not responded to Northern provocation in order to avoid escalation, not because they are incapable. SK conventional superiority is augmented further by US assistance.

::'''SS''': South Korea will decisively win most direct conventional engagements with the North, but is vulnerable in selected theaters where North Korea perceives a lack of readiness or a tactical advantage.

{{WNIQ}} Is the closure of {{w|Kaesong}} by North Korea, evidence of further escalating tensions between the two nations?
::'''RK''': Yes and no. It is important, because it is a source of hard currency for the North, so its closure suggests that the North is willing to carry genuine costs over this feud. On the other hand, the SK media identified the closure of Kaesong early as a marker of NK seriousness, saying very openly that if NK did not close the facility, they did not really mean what they were saying. In other words, NK was, I think, goaded into closing Kaesong in the war of words, not as a part of any larger strategic plan.

::'''SS''': Thus far, it is a symbolic evidence of potential for escalating tensions, but has not yet resulted in material changes.  Let's see how the situation plays out over the next couple of days.  Kaesong will only become vulnerable when operations halt and when financial transfers connected to failure of operations become operative.

{{WNIQ}} North Korea has moved one of its missiles that carries a large range missile to its East Coast, is this a serious move?
[[File:Interview with Dr.Kelly - Q1.ogv|thumb|right|300px]]
::'''RK''': I don't think it's as serious a move as the [[media]] has made it out to be. First of all they just moved one [missile]. Second of all, it's not clear that North Korea actually has nuclear warheads that are small enough to actually put on top of missiles; they tell us this but nuclear weapons are actually pretty heavy, which is why {{w|nuclear missiles}} are frequently quite large, so moving the weapon there doesn't necessarily mean it's pointed at the United States or [[Tokyo]] which I suppose would be the likely targets. It's not clear that it's necessarily a nuclear missile and it's not being fueled or anything so far as I know so again it's sort of more of the same... bluffing...sort of talking around the issue and sort of saying things that don't actually have genuine consequences so my sense is it's more of a war of words.

{{WNIQ}} There's a lot of talk about [[Kim Jong-un]] being an inexperienced leader &mdash; do you think he knows where the 'brink' lies?
[[File:Interview with Dr.Kelly - Q2.ogv|thumb|right|300px]]
::'''RK''': That's actually a really good question. No, I don't, which is why we're having this whole conversation. Kim's father, Kim the second [<nowiki/>[[Kim Jong-il]]<nowiki/>], was actually very good about this, "good" in quotations I suppose. He knew really well how to play this game, he knew really well how to play the South, particularly for aid, rice, assistance, fuel, things like that. The new guy — he's only been in there for a year-and-a-half, right, 14, 15 months — he didn't go through the grooming institutions of the regime, he didn't go through the military or the party. And he certainly has no military training, it's not like he went to some military institute — he went to some boarding school in [[Switzerland]], or something like that. So it's not at all clear that this guy knows, sort of how this is done. I have a feeling myself that he's being egged on by the generals at home, and the generals are really doing this because they do not want the military's position to be lowered in the new order. Under the previous Kim, under the second Kim [Kim-Jong-il], the military was raised in the constitution to a very high level of importance, they were sort of the primary pillar of the government, this is called the {{w|Songun|'Military First'}} policy. I think people now worry that the new Kim — in order to re-start the economy might downgrade the role of the military, and I think that is where all this is coming from. I don't think they want a war. 

{{WNIQ}} All of these threats, do you think they are just a way of getting more economic aid from the United Nations?
[[File:Interview with Dr.Kelly - Q3.ogv|thumb|right|300px]]
::'''RK''': I wouldn't say the [[United Nations]] [UN] because the UN role in this is actually pretty minimal. It is true that there are some UN specialized agencies that operate in North Korea — the {{w|World Food Programme}} I believe is the big one because North Korea constantly has food problems &mdash; and there are western {{w|Non-governmental organization|NGOs}}, and {{w|aid|aid groups}}, {{w|charities}} and stuff like that, also operate in North Korea. I've actually been to North Korea and I've seen these charities operate. I've actually met some of the people who actually live there and do this stuff. But they're actually pretty small, right? I mean, the North Koreans are pretty worried about {{w|Westerners}} running around in North Korea making trouble and saying things and this and that. Any kind of foreign penetration in North Korea is very, very limited. I think the real issue is actually North Korea's neighbors, specifically [[Japan]], [[China]], the United States and South Korea. Russia's really sort of a {{wikt|bit player}} in this drama. And that's what they really want, the North Koreans now are very dependent on ''only'' the Chinese. They used to be able to play the Chinese off the South Koreans off the Japanese off the Americans and extract aid and concessions from each of those. In the last ten years or so it has become harder to do that — particularly Japan, the United States and South Korea have closed ranks and don't really deal individually with North Korea anymore. This has pushed North Korea to China. North Korea doesn't like being dependent on just one player. And so I think that's what this is an effort to shake up, [...] a very difficult game for the North were they an economic colony of China.

Haitian cholera victims threaten United Nations with lawsuit
{{United Nations}}

Lawyers representing [[Haiti]]an {{w|cholera}} victims warned the [[United Nations]] (UN) on May 7, if they do not admit liability for the spread of cholera in 2010, they'll be sued. Lawyers demand the UN apologize to and compensate the victims and improve sanitation efforts.

Lawyers claim the UN is breaking international law by failing to apologize or provide remuneration to the victims. They're seeking a minimum of {{w|United States dollars|USD}}$100,000 each for families of the deceased and $50,000 for each survivor. So far, over 8,000 people have died and thousands more have been infected with the disease.

UN peacekeepers, whom arrived in Haiti after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]], are being blamed for the spread of the disease which started near the troop's encampment. According to the lawsuit, waste from the UN camp was not properly sanitized, causing bacteria to enter the tributary of the Artibonite River, one of Haiti's largest. Prior to the arrival of troops, Haiti had not encountered problems related to the disease since the 1800s. The {{w|Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy}} has referenced independent studies that suggest the [[Nepal]]ese UN peacekeeping battalion unknowingly brought the disease to Haiti. Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on the disease, stated the outbreak was likely caused by the peacekeepers.

Scientists from Pacific Bio-sciences of California Inc. analyzed the bacteria in Haiti and concluded its genome is an almost identical match to samples recovered in South [[Asia]], but different to those found in Latin America.

The UN continues to deny any responsibility for the cholera outbreak and claims it is immune from further legal proceedings. Nearly 8,000 people have vowed to join the lawsuit.

Ajp491/UN says 93,000 confirmed deaths in the Syrian war
{{DR}}{{tasks|news|re-review|nocat=yes}}
{{date|June 13, 2013}}

[[File:Flag of Syria.svg|200px|left]]

{{Syria}}

The {{w|United Nations|nocat=1}}’ human rights office has revealed that almost 93,000 people have been killed in the {{w|Syrian civil war}}, although the actual number is likely to be ‘much higher’. The U.N. announce on Thursday that there has been 92, 901 confirmed killings between March 2011 up until the end of April this year, including at least 6,500 children.

“Unfortunately, as the study indicates, this is most likely a minimum casualty figure. The true number of those killed is potentially much higher,” UN rights chief Navi Pillay said in a statement. "The constant flow of killings continues at shockingly high levels, with more than 5,000 killings documented every month since last July."

The study, which relied mostly on statistical information, showed that 80% of the victims are male. The majority of the study does not indicate age, or differentiate between civilians and soldiers.

The report comes less than a month after the U.N. released a separate annual global report on children and armed conflict, which states that children in Syria have been tortured, used as human shields, maimed, and used as soldiers during the conflict. It also coincides with current government debates in Washington over the decision to provide arms assistance to the Syrian opposition to President {{w|Bashar al-Assad|nocat=1}}’s government.

Syrian army bombs Damascus suburbs after allegedly using chemical weapons on them
{{date|August 23, 2013}}
{{Syria}}
After the [[Syria]]n government denied the army used chemical weapons against the densely populated eastern {{w|Ghouta}} region of [[Damascus]] on Wednesday, armed forces heavily bombed the neighborhood yesterday.

Reports say anywhere between 100 and 1,300 people were killed in Wednesday's alleged chemical attack, but there are no reports of injuries or deaths in yesterday's bombings. Many of those killed appeared to be children. Some of the pictures and video coming out of the country don't show blood and dismembered bodies, but instead show, according to witnesses, those who died from apparent suffocation; some were foaming at the mouth and others were having convulsions. <!-- http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/21/syria-witnesses-describe-alleged-chemical-attacks -->One video posted to [[YouTube]] purportedly shows a young girl who survived the alleged attack, yelling "I’m alive, I’m alive." At one point, according to ''{{w|The Washington Post}}'', the girl even tries to convince the hospital official she is still alive.
 <!--See: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/08/21/the-one-video-from-syrias-alleged-chemical-weapons-attack-that-everyone-should-watch/ for the reporting of no blood and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF6wHbgT2XU -->

The bombings come as [[United Nations]] observers began to arrive to investigate claims of chemical weapons use elsewhere in the nation. According to [[Russia]]n officials, the Syrian government is ready to give UN observers "maximum cooperation" while they perform their investigation.

"We hope that the results will clarify the issue and will help to dispel numerous speculations around the alleged use of the Syrian chemical weapons while simultaneously creating a positive background for the moves towards the start of the political process of settlement of the Syrian crisis," Aleksandr Lukashevich, Russia's foreign minister, said yesterday. Syrian officials say the alleged chemical attack was staged and carried out by rebel forces to "draw attention to their cause" ahead of the arrival of UN observers.

Deputy Secretary-General of the UN, Jan Eliasson, called the alleged chemical attack 'shocking' and hopes the Syrian government will allow UN observers into the neighborhood as soon as possible. 

"We see the need to investigate this as soon as possible; no matter what the conclusions, this represents a serious escalation with grave humanitarian and human consequences," said Eliasson who also added there is no confirmation that chemical weapons were used in Wednesday's bombing.

A previous attempt by the UN to end the violence in Syria failed. In May of 2012, a UN convoy was hit by an {{w|Improvised explosive device|IED}} (improvised explosive device) while a human rights group reported a Syrian military attack on civilians at a nearby funeral in the town of {{w|Khan Shaykhun|Khan Sheikhoun}} in {{w|Idlib Governorate|Idlib province}}. Later that year in August, a 300 person team left the country after their mandate expired, and was never renewed. Commander of the 2012 observation team General Babacar Gaye expressed frustration against both the Syrian armed forces and rebels for not allowing the UN to complete its mission.

"Initially the ceasefire was respected, violence decreased and we were able to do our work throughout the country, [but] by the middle of June it was clear that the parties were no longer committed to the ceasefire and the result has been an escalation in violence," said Gaye in 2012.

The UN's 2012 mandate was to; "monitor a cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties [and to] monitor and support the full implementation of the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab States six-point-plan." Part of the plan included both sides working and cooperating with the UN special envoy, commitment to ceasing hostilities, and the Syrian army ceasing troop and tank movements against rebels in "population centers" throughout the country.

Soldiers in Syria reportedly 'suffocated' while seizing chemicals, weapons in Damascus suburb
{{date|August 25, 2013}}
{{Syria}}
According to state-run {{w|Syrian Arab News Agency}} (SANA), during a battle with rebels yesterday the Syrian army seized a stockpile of chemicals, canisters, weapons and gear located in a warehouse tunnel in {{w|Jobar}}, a suburb of [[Damascus, Syria|Damascus]]. In a post on the social networking website [[Twitter]], SANA claims some soldiers involved in the battle were exposed to some kind of chemical agent and in some cases "suffocated," but the number of those killed, if any, was not reported. <!-- https://twitter.com/SANA_English/status/371243288558174208 for official claim of suffocation. NOTE: SANA website is not accessible...not even through the several proxies I tried. -->

"Army heroes are entering the tunnels of the terrorists and saw chemical agents", said SANA, as quoted by {{w|Al-Alam News Network}}. "It is believed that the terrorists have used chemical weapons in the area", quoted by {{w|CNN}}. The Syrian government often labels members of the {{w|Free Syrian Army}} and other rebels as "terrorists." 

SANA says government forces were fighting rebels and pushed into Jobar where they seized the items in a warehouse. In a video by SANA and published by {{w|RT News}}, at least one of those items, a box labeled "coverall - CW protective," was made in the [[United States]]. Antidotes for chemical agents allegedly from the "The [[Qatar]]i-[[Germany|German]] Company for Pharmaceutical Industries" and materials from [[Saudi Arabia]] were also among the items seized. Pictures also show grenades, rockets and what appear to be several other unknown chemical agents. Government forces say the stockpile belonged to rebels and opposition forces.<!-- watch video at http://rt.com/news/rebel-tunnel-damascus-chemical-940/ time: 00:46 and pause to see the box with label-->

The country's largest opposition group, The Syrian National Coalition (CNFROS), released a statement denying the use of chemical weapons in both today's and Wednesday's battles. They deny even possessing chemical weapons saying the "information disclosed by the regime [is] false" and the accusations attempt "to disguise and conceal his [<nowiki/>[[Bashar al-Assad|Assad]]'s] repeated and systematic crimes against Syrian civilians." <!-- This paragraph from: http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1902500/0/regimen-sirio/acusa-rebeldes/armas-quimicas-damasco/ and the google translation can be found here: http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.20minutos.es%2Fnoticia%2F1902500%2F0%2Fregimen-sirio%2Facusa-rebeldes%2Farmas-quimicas-damasco%2F&act=url (I hope between my rusty Spanish skills and the translation tool, I got the quotation in English right without putting into context). -->

The seizure comes just days after government forces were accused of carrying out a large-scale chemical attack in the {{w|Ghouta}} region of Damascus on Wednesday. Reports say anywhere between 100 and 1,300 people were killed in the attack. Prior to today's incident and after Wednesday's alleged chemical attack, government forces heavily bombed the area. 

The fighting comes as [[United Nations]] observers arrived to investigate claims of chemical weapons use elsewhere in the nation. According to one report, government forces have retaken control of Jobar.

United States spies accused of illegally bugging the United Nations headquarters
{{date|August 26, 2013}}

[[File:Nsa sign.jpg|File photo of the sign of the National Security Agency headquarters. {{image credit|National Security Agency}}|thumb|left]]

[[Germany|German]] weekly publication ''{{w|Der Spiegel}}'' yesterday accused the [[United States]]' [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) of spying on the [[United Nations]] headquarters in [[New York]]. The magazine claims to have access to official NSA documents, provided by former NSA and [[CIA]] computer specialist and current fugitive {{w|Edward Snowden}}.

If the allegations of bugging are confirmed, it would mean that the United States has breached International Treaties including the 1946 {{w|Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations}}. The Treaty states that countries must not carry out covert operations that relate to the UN's activities.

"The property and assets of the United Nations, wherever located and by whomsoever held, shall be immune from search, requisition, confiscation, expropriation and any other form of interference, whether by executive, administrative, judicial or legislative action", the Convention stipulates.

The documents analysed by ''Der Spiegel'' indicate that the NSA runs bugging programs in more than 80 embassies and consulates across the globe, in what is reportedly called the "Special Collection Service". 

''Der Spiegel'' claimed that, according to their intelligence, the NSA was able to bug the UN headquarters by hacking into its video conferencing system in the summer of 2012. Their article included quotes from the leaked documents like "“The data traffic gives us internal video teleconferences of the United Nations (yay!)". 

Allegedly, decoded UN communications rose from 12 to 458 within three weeks of the NSA gaining access. Analysed documents also indicated the NSA found evidence {{w|China|Chinese}} spies were also monitoring the UN, and began logging what the Chinese were accessing.

The UN's nuclear watchdog in {{w|Vienna}}, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], and the [[European Union]] are said to be among the organisations NSA spies have been targeting. The US government has previously denied any wrongdoing by the NSA, although President [[Barack Obama]] this month announced plans to curb government spying activities.

UN observers in Syria fired upon as report alleges US warplanes readying attack
{{date|August 28, 2013}}
{{Syria}}
On Monday, the convoy used by a [[United Nations]] (UN)<!--observation/investigation team??--> investigation team while gathering evidence of an alleged [[chemical weapons]] attack in [[Syria]] of August 21, was fired upon by snipers. 

No injuries were reported in the attack, but the UN says at least one vehicle was destroyed and several were shot at. It's not clear whether rebels or the Syrian army were responsible for the attack. The team left the scene and returned at a later time with a new vehicle. 

"What I am told is that despite the very difficult circumstances, our team replaced their car and returned to the suburbs of [[Damascus]] to carry out their investigation," said UN Secretary-General {{w|Ban Ki-moon}} in a statement on Monday. Both the rebels and Syrian government are said to have been granted "safe" passage while performing their investigation which has to be completed in 14 days, not including any possible extensions.

The team arrived on August 18 and is investigating the scene of an alleged chemical weapons attack that occurred on August 21 in the {{w|Ghouta}} suburb of Damascus. Reports say anywhere between 100 and 1,300 people were killed in the attack which is being blamed on government forces, something they deny. "We hope that the results will clarify the issue and will help to dispel numerous speculations around the alleged use of the Syrian chemical weapons while simultaneously creating a positive background for the moves towards the start of the political process of settlement of the Syrian crisis," Aleksandr Lukashevich, Russia's foreign minister, said on August 22.

This isn't the first time a UN convoy has been targeted in Syria. In May 2012 a convoy was hit by an {{w|Improvised Explosive Device}} (IED) while one of their human rights groups reported a Syrian military attack on civilians at a nearby funeral in the Syrian town of {{w|Khan Shaykhun|Khan Sheikhoun}} in {{w|Idlib Governorate|Idlib province}}. Three Marked UN vehicles were damaged in the attack but no one was injured.

The latest attack on the UN comes as a US government official called their current investigation "too late to be credible." Following the alleged chemical attack on August 21, the Syrian army heavily bombed the area against what they called rebel strongholds. "The fact is that much of the evidence could have been destroyed by that artillery bombardment," said {{w|William Hague}} the Foreign Secretary of the [[United Kingdom]] on Sunday. The [[United States]] (U.S.) says the attacks are "corrupting" any evidence the team might have come in contact with.

Two reports by the British newspaper {{w|The Guardian}} suggest the U.S. might not wait for the team to finish their investigation. According to the reports, U.S. transport planes have been arriving within 100 miles of Syria in {{w|Cyprus}}. The Guardian cites sources which say U.S. Forces are "ready to go" in the event a strike on Syria is ordered. 

"We are prepared, we have moved assets in place to be able to fulfil and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take, if he wishes to take any of the options he's asked for," said U.S. Secretary of Defense {{w|Chuck Hagel}} on Tuesday.

According to the newspaper's report, commercial airline pilots claim to have observed {{w|Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130}} transport planes visually and fighter jet formations by radar. The newspaper also claims residents say military activity has been increased. According to {{w|Wikileaks}}, the whistle blowing website, a document shows the U.S. would use Cyprus as the main base of operations to launch an airstrike against Syria. <!--Wikileaks makes that claim here: https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/372108511913590784 -->The document is part of a 2012 leak labeled the "Global Intelligence Files" which consists of emails from within the global intelligence firm {{w|Stratfor}}.

"The main base they would use is Cyprus, hands down. Brits and {{w|France|French}} would fly out of there. They kept stressing how much is stored at Cyprus and how
much recce comes out of there," says part of an email in a communication by Stratfor employees<!-- officials?? -->. ''[[wikt:recce|Recce]]'' is an abbreviation for ''reconnaissance''. <!-- http://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/1671459_insight-military-intervention-in-syria-post-withdrawal.html -->

Civilians began protesting against Assad in March of 2011. One of the first cities government forces began to attack in an effort to stop the protests was {{w|Homs, Syria|Homs}}. In July of that year, at least one person was killed and dozens injured when government forces opened fire on protesters. <!-- https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Syrian_security_forces_raid_Homs,_one_killed,_twenty_injured -->Late that month, government forces launched an offensive against protesters across the nation, resulting in around 100 deaths in the city of {{w|Hama}} and several dozen more in other parts of the country.

Wikinews interviews Dr Thomas Scotto and Dr Steve Hewitt about potential US military intervention in Syria

The [[United States]] {{w|President of the United States|President}}, [[Barack Obama]], announced on Saturday he was seeking [[United States Congress|Congressional]] authorisation for military intervention in [[Syria]]. 

''Wikinews'' interviewed Professor of Government Dr. Thomas Scotto from the {{w|UK}}'s {{w|University of Essex}} and Senior Lecturer in American and Canadian Studies Dr. Steve Hewitt from the UK's [[University of Birmingham]] about the proposed military intervention by the USA in Syria.

{{WNIQ|Wikinews}} What is your job role?
::'''Dr. Thomas Scotto''':  I am a Professor of Government, teaching courses in quantitative methods, public opinion, political behaviour, and American Politics.  I have been at Essex since January, 2007.  I am the Principal Investigator of a major ESRC grant on public opinion on foreign policy attitudes in five nations (Great Britain, United States, {{w|Canada}}, {{w|France}}, {{w|Germany}}, {{w|Italy}}).

::'''Dr. Steve Hewitt''': Dr. Steve Hewitt, Senior Lecturer in American and Canadian Studies [at the University of Birmingham].

{{WNIQ}} The Republican speaker {{w|John Boehner}} is endorsing Barack Obama's strategy, do you think this will lead to Congress authorising military intervention?
::'''TS''': Ultimately, I believe that the President will succeed, but I doubt it will be a neat voter &mdash; there will be a significant number of {{w|Democratic Party (US)|Democrats}} and {{w|Republican Party (US)|Republicans}} who do not fall into line and vote against intervention.

::I think the real story is that in the past two weeks, we have seen an amazing shift in how the Executives of the United States (President Obama) and the United Kingdom (Prime Minister {{w|David Cameron|Cameron}}) execute foreign policy.  In the post-War period, committing the nation to take military action was seen as the prerogative of the President and Prime Minister, with the legislatures of both countries providing, at best, weak oversight.

:: In the United States, there is the {{w|War Powers Act}} and the authorisation of the first Gulf War, but the President's authority was rarely challenged nor was it really believed that the President needed to consult Congress.  In the UK, you would have to go back to the late 1700s to find the last time a Prime Minister was truly rebuffed on a matter of military intervention.

:: Why is that?  I think it's war fatigue on the part of the public and the average member of the {{w|UK Parliament}} and the US Congress. A significant number of those sitting on the backbenches of Parliament and in the Congress are thinking of balancing their nations' budgets in times of fiscal austerity, and they have ties to constituencies, which don't want to see their country shed blood and treasure in another prolonged conflict in the {{w|Middle East}} where the backgrounds of the rebel groups the US and UK are supporting is not well defined and the end goals are uncertain.

::'''SH''': Not necessarily. Boehner has not been able to carry Republicans in the past. His being onside increases the chances of authorization but it doesn't make it inevitable.

[[File:State Department map of Gouta chemical attack.svg|thumb|left|320px|US State Department map of Damascus areas of influence and areas reportedly affected by by chemical attack on August 21.  {{image credit|{{w|US State Department}}}}]]

{{WNIQ}}  Is the US general public in support of taking military intervention in Syria?
::'''TS''': No, not at all.  We've polled a representative sample of the American public in June of 2012, February of 2013, and this summer.  Support for intervention in Syria has not moved.  In our surveys fewer than 1 [in] 5 respondents were open to the idea of sending American ground troops into Syria.  This was true regardless whether their aim was to provide humanitarian assistance or topple {{w|Bashar al-Assad|al-Assad}}.  There are also low levels of support for arming the rebels.  What is amazing is that, despite the reported use of chemical weapons and the deaths and displacement of 100,000s of Syrians, there has been little change in support levels over the time period we've been in the field with our surveys.

::'''SH''': No, clearly the American public is not in favour of intervening in Syria. About 60% are opposed in the latest poll.

[[File:President Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|right|200px| A file photo of {{w|Barack Obama}}. {{image source|The White House}}]]

{{WNIQ}}  The British Parliament voted against military intervention in Syria, do you think this has led Obama to put a vote to Congress?
::'''TS''':  I think Obama wants Congress to own this.  Some in Congress believe that the United States would be doing too little if it only carried out limited missile strikes to punish al-Assad.  Other Members are dead set against intervention of any type.  The President was finding it impossible to please everyone, and instead, basically said sort out what you want me to do.  It is an amazing turn of events where the President might be constraining himself in terms of the response he could take.  Obama's decision may have ramifications for Executive-Legislative relations in the US for years to come.

::'''SH''':That may have played a role but it is still not clear why President Obama has taken this course. It may also be the case that he is looking to share the political risk that goes with attacking with Republicans and Congress in general.

{{WNIQ}}  After more than a decade of war in {{w|Iraq}} and {{w|Afghanistan}}, does the US general public feel disillusioned in taking military action?
::'''TS''':  Yes, definitely.  Less than half of the American public believes the Iraq war was a success, and we have found that those who believe that the previous conflicts in the Middle East were a failure are likely to be those opposing action against Syria.  So many people think the Iraq and Afghanistan interventions cost too much and did little good &mdash; it's really weighing on the public's mood at this time.

::'''SH''': Yes, there clearly is fatigue in relation to interventions and the lack of clear resolutions of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

{{WNIQ}}  Do you think military intervention in Syria will affect {{w|Russia}}–United States relations?
::'''TS''':  It is hard to say &mdash; in the short term, yes.  In the long term, it really depends on how {{w|Vladimir Putin|Putin}} sees the long term interests of himself and his nation vis-à-vis the United States and America's western allies.

::'''SH''': Yes, although relations are already tense. How extensive any attack by the US on Syria will determine the full impact on US&ndash;Russia relations.

Wikinews interviews Scott Lucas, Eyal Zisser, Majid Rafizadeh about risks of US military intervention in Syria
{{date|September 8, 2013}}
{{Politics and conflicts}}
{{missing image|File:Prof. Scott Lucas 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px| File photo of Prof. Scott Lucas. {{image source|Scott Lucas}}}}
The [[United States]] {{w|President of the United States|President}} [[Barack Obama]] announced last Saturday he was seeking [[United States Congress|Congressional]] authorisation for military intervention in [[Syria]]. 

Looking for more-qualified input, ''Wikinews'' interviewed: professor '''''Scott Lucas''''', an expert in American Studies, from the [[UK]]'s [[University of Birmingham]]; the President of the {{w|International American Council}} on the Middle East, {{w|Majid Rafizadeh|'''''Majid Rafizadeh'''''}}; and, professor '''''Eyal Zisser''''', a Syrian expert, from {{w|Tel Aviv University}}.

Discussing the risks involved with US military intervention in Syria, ''Wikinews'' posed a range of questions to these experts on the region's political climate.

{{WNIQ|Wikinews}} Is it possible for the US to take military action to deter further use of [[chemical weapons]] without getting dragged into the {{w|Syrian civil war|civil war}}?
:*'''Prof. Scott Lucas''':  The US is already involved in the civil war &mdash; the question is to what extent.
::The US has given political support to the opposition and insurgency since late 2011, and from summer 2012, it has pursued covert support to the opposition fighters.
::However, the Obama Administration has been hesitant about overt support for insurgents throughout the conflict, and that has affected co-ordination of covert efforts. In June, the Administration finally said it would provide overt military assistance, but then pulled back and failed to deliver any public aid.
::Had it not been for the August, 21 chemical weapons attack, that position would have persisted.
:*'''Majid Rafizadeh''': It depends on the scope of the military operation. If United States conducts limited military operation, as the adminstration argues, and if US only targets some of the Syrian government's military installments, it is less likely that United States will be drawn into the Syria's civil war. It would be a political suicide for Syria, Iran or Hezbollah to respond. 
::On the other hand, if Assad observes that the balance of power is tilting against him inside the country, he might use chemical weapons in the future despite US limited strikes. 
:*'''Prof. Eyal Zisser''': Yes, it[sic]</sup> the attack is limited. And If the Americans only use missiles. They can cause severe damage, but leave Assad in his palace, and not being dragged into the civil war.

{{WNIQ}} Will military intervention from the US affect long term relations between the United States and Russia?
:*'''SL''': Of course, significant military intervention by Washington will affect relations between the US and Russia, but the long-term effect cannot be predicted.
:: It is dependent on Russia's reaction &mdash; so far, Moscow has been able to pressure the US into caution, but a decision for intervention by the US might call Russia's bluff, so to speak, and force some caution by the Russians. Already, Moscow has said it will not join a fight against any US military action.
:: And, of course, the long-term relationship is dependent on the political and military success of any US intervention.
:*'''MR''': Military intervention, in the classic sense of putting troops on the ground, will definitely affect US-Russian long term political relationships.  It might heighten the diplomatic tensions.  However, the limited military operation is less likely [to] change US-Russian long term economic, geopolitical, and political relationships. 
:*'''EZ''': No. They need each other in many other places of the world. Russia knows that the US is a super power and will not be interested in a real conflict with Washington. 

{{WNIQ}} The British Parliament voted against military intervention in Syria, do you think this has affected their relations with the United States?
:*'''SL''': No &mdash; had the Obama Administration been united and decisive for intervention, there might have been some effect. But the Obama Administration's divisions mean its first priority is getting some coherence in Washington, rather than blaming London.
:*'''MR''': I don't think so. I believe that [the] UK has been [the] staunchest ally of the United States for decades.  One instance of opposing parliamentary vote will not have impact on US-UK relations. 
:*'''EZ''': Maybe. But Britain is not an important power any more, so the affect will be only in the symbolic field.

{{WNIQ}} Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia could back Syrian intervention if there was conclusive proof of regime guilt. What sort of evidence would be needed and can this level of assurance be given?
:*'''SL''': This is not a scientific question &mdash; we already have extensive evidence establishing the near-certainty of major regime attacks with chemical weapons on 7 towns on August 21.
::Putin's statement was a political move: it ostensibly re-confirmed the Russian opposition to US intervention while giving Moscow a way to step back if the UN inspectors return a damning report.
:*'''MR''': It is difficult, if not impossible, to provide Moscow  with the evidence that they are looking for. In order to provide that specific information several criterions should  be met. First of all, the soil of the location where the alleged chemical weapons are used, should immediately be examined after the incident. The Syrian government has not allowed immediate access to these places and usually reports come out days after. Second, and more fundamentally, a concrete and observable evidence is needed for Russia showing that Assad's government has used it as opposed to the rebels. 
:*'''EZ''': No the Russians are not after the truth but after their interests even if Assad admits that he used such weapon the Russians will be against any intervention.
[[File:Bombed out vehicles Aleppo.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Bombed out vehicles in {{w|Aleppo}} during the Syrian civil war. {{image source|{{w|Voice of America}}}}]]

{{WNIQ}} Would US military intervention on Syria be a violation of International law?
:*'''SL''':  This is a grey area, especially as there will not be an endorsement by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Supporters of the action say it can be justified under the recent doctrine of humanitarian intervention, but that is more a political rather than legal judgement.
:*'''MR''': Legally speaking, it is [in] violation of [the] United Nations Charter. According to [the] {{w|UN Charter}}, use of force is permitted only in case of self-defense or UNSC's [United Nations Security Council] approval. Neither of these two cases apply for US use of military force against Syria. However, this does not mean that our current international law is devoid of any shortcomings. The International system has some shortcomings because of the structure of the UNSC, where one member can veto a resolution and block actions. 
:*'''EZ''': Technically &mdash; yes because they did not get an approval from the UN.

{{WNIQ}} Does the United States seem to be wanting to engage in regime change in Syria as opposed to preventing further chemical attacks?
:*'''SL''': No, the Obama Administration has been uncertain about &mdash; and many of its members opposed to &mdash; regime change, and that is still the situation. The military, in particular, is opposed to significant, long-term intervention because of its concerns over a fragmented, diverse opposition and what happens if Assad falls.
:*'''MR''': If there was an efficient alternative to Assad, US would have seen the regime change to its political benefits and interests. However, United States does not seem to have articulated any precise agenda towards Syria yet. The policy is more " Wait and See" policy; observing and reacting as things unfold in Syria and the region.  
:*'''EZ''':  No Obama does not want it, he finds himself being dragged into a war he has no interest in.

Wikinews interviews specialists on China, Iran, Russia support for al-Assad
{{date|September 23, 2013}}

Over the past week, diplomatic actions have averted &mdash; or, at least delayed &mdash; military strikes on [[Syria]] by the [[United States]]. ''Wikinews'' sought input from a range of international experts on the situation; and, the tensions caused by [[Russia]]'s support for the [[Bashar al-Assad|al-Assad]] regime despite its apparent use of [[chemical weapons]].
{{TOCleft}}{{missing image|File:Ghouta chemical attack map.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of areas affected by chemical weapons in {{w|2013 Ghouta attacks|Ghouta}}, Syria. {{image source|[[commons:User:FutureTrillionaire|FutureTrillionaire]]}}}}
Tensions in the country increased dramatically, late August when it was reported between 100 and 1,300 people were killed in an alleged chemical attack. Many of those killed appeared to be children, with some of the pictures and video coming out of the country showing &mdash; according to witnesses &mdash; those who died from apparent suffocation; some foaming at the mouth, others having convulsions.

Amongst Syria's few remaining allies, [[Iran]], [[China]], and Russia continue to oppose calls for military intervention. In an effort to provide a better-understanding of the reasoning behind their ongoing support, the following people were posed a range of questions.

== Interviewees ==

:* '''''Stephen Blank''''', Senior Fellow at the {{w|American Foreign Policy Council}} in [[Washington, D.C.]]
:* '''''Kerry Brown''''', Professor of Chinese Politics from the [[University of Sydney]], [[Australia]]
:* '''''Farideh Farhi''''', an Affiliate with the Graduate Faculty of Political Science, and lecturer, at the ̣̣[[University of Hawai'i]], {{w|Honolulu}}
:* '''''Mehran Kamrava''''', Professor and Director of the {{w|Center for International and Regional Studies}} at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington D.C.
:* '''''{{w|William C. Martel|William Martel}}''''', Professor of International Security Studies at [[Tufts University]] near [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]
:* '''''Rana Mitter''''', Professor of the History and Politics of Modern China at the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]]
:* '''''Walter Posch''''', an Iran expert at the {{w|German Institute for International and Security Affairs}} (SWP) in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]; and,
:* '''''Sam Roggeveen''''', a fellow of the [[Lowy Institute for International Policy]] in [[Sydney]], Australia

== ''Wikinews'' Q&amp;A ==

{{w|Iran}}, {{w|China}}, and {{w|Russia}} have remained as allies to the {{w|Bashar al-Assad|al-Assad}} government despite the alleged use of chemical weapons in {{w|2013 Ghouta attacks|Ghouta}} on August 21, 2013. ''Wikinews'' queried the listed subject-matter experts regarding the diplomatic relations between these nations, and the reasoning behind such.

=== China ===
[[File:United Nations Security Council 4-3-crop.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|File photo of {{w|United Nations Security Council}} Chamber in {{w|New York City|New York}}. {{image source|Patrick Gruban}}]]
{{WNIQ|Wikinews}} There are suggestions China wants to maintain its financial ties with Syria as its third largest importer in 2010. Would you agree with this?

:*'''Brown''': I don't think that is China's key priority. China has a massive economy, and Syria is a very minor player in this. It has some, but not much, energy from Syria. Its real concerns in the current conflict are for stability, and geopolitical.
:*'''Farhi''': China's conduct in Syria has been similar to its conduct elsewhere. It has given support to Russia in international forum such as the UNSC [''{{w|United Nations Security Council}}''] and has acted opportunistically wherever its economic interest could be pursued. But, Syria is really not an area of interest for China. Its actions and support for the Russian position is derived from its general concerns regarding American imperialism and unilateralism.
:*'''Mitter''': China will want, in general, to maintain financial ties with Syria as it does with many countries.  China's general position is that internal politics of countries should not interfere with economic ties.
<hr />
{{WNIQ}} Do you think China is talking from experience when it says that foreign countries shouldn't get involved with Syria's internal affairs?[[File:Sam Loggeveen.jpeg|thumb|left|140px|File photo of interviewee Sam Roggeveen. {{image source|Sam Roggeveen}}]]
:*'''Roggeveen''': That stance reflects China’s history as a weak, developing country with a host of territorial disputes with its neighbours. {{w|Beijing}} does not want to set international precedents that will allow third parties to interfere with, for example, the {{w|Taiwan}} issue, {{w|Tibet}}, the {{w|East China Sea}} or the {{w|South China Sea}}.
::But increasingly, China’s stance will conflict with its growing strength and growing responsibilities on the world stage. China is already the world’s second biggest economy and a major strategic power in the Asia Pacific [''region'']; and, it will increasingly be expected to take up responsibilities that come with such power. Also, as we saw in the case of {{w|Libya}} &mdash; where China sent a fleet of ships and aircraft to evacuate its nationals &mdash; China has interests and citizens all over the world, both of which need to be protected.
:*'''Brown''': It [''China''] has always stood by non interference of other counties in the internal affairs of sovereign states; though, this position has changed over time since it was formulated on the back of China's experience of colonisation in the early part of the twentieth-century. Its main priority now is to not see the escalation of issues, as was seen in {{w|Iraq}} and {{w|Afghanistan}}; where it runs the risk of being sucked into lengthy conflicts with no real gameplan, and no clear outcome that is relevant to it. It does not see the Syria[''n''] conflict [''as''] one where there is a an easy, viable, alternative option waiting to govern the country. And, it is very sceptical about US and others' claims that they can control this problem. 
:*'''Farhi''': Yes, rejection of interference in the internal affairs of other countries &mdash; particularly of a military kind &mdash; is a principled Chinese position in areas where China doesn't have an over-riding interest.
:*'''Mitter''': China has been a hardline advocate of strong territorial sovereignty for decades.  This is, in part, a product of its own history of being invaded and occupied by other countries.
[[File:RanaMitter.jpg|thumb|right|140px|File photo of interviewee Rana Mitter. {{image source|Rana Mitter}}]]
<hr />
{{WNIQ}} China abstained from a UN Security Council resolution on Libya &mdash; do you think they are trying to reprise what happened in Libya in terms of regime change?
:*'''Roggeveen''': China and Russia suspect the 'responsibility to protect' doctrine, which was used by Western powers to justify the Libya intervention, was a smokescreen for regime change. So, they are wary of seeing something similar happen in Syria. China also prefers not to be on its own in the Security Council; so, if the Russians come down against a Libya-like resolution, [''the''] chances are that China will join them.
:*'''Brown''': They felt there was clear mission-creep with Libya. What, however, has most emboldened them in opposing action in Syria is the position of Russia; which they have been able to stand behind. Diplomatically they dislike isolation, so this has proved the issue they have taken cover from.
:*'''Farhi''': Libya has set a bad precedent for many countries who supported, or did not object to, NATO action. So, yes, the Libya example is a precedent; but, in any case, the Syrian dynamics are much more complex than Libya and both Russia and China &mdash; as well as Iran &mdash; genuinely  see the attempt to resolve the imbroglio in Syria through military means as truly dangerous. In other words, they see the conduct of Western powers in the past two years as spawning policies that are tactically geared to weaken the Assad regime without a clear sense or strategy regarding what the end game should be. Particularly since at least part of the opposition to Assad has also elicited support from {{w|Islam|Islamic}} radicals.
:*'''Mitter''': In general China is reluctant to take decisive action in international society, and [''at''] the UN. It prefers its partners, such as Russia, to take on confrontational roles while it tries to remain more neutral and passive.
<hr />

{{WNIQ}} Do you think a political solution is the only realistic means to resolve the Syrian issue?
[[File:Professor Kerry Brown.jpg|thumb|right|140px|File photo of interviewee Kerry Brown. {{image source|Kerry Brown}}]]
:* '''Roggeveen''': At the moment, both sides [''in Syria''] evidently feel they can still obtain their objectives through force. Perhaps one of them will be proved right; or, perhaps there will be a long-term stalemate with Syria split between regime and opposition forces.
:: One important change is the chemical weapons agreement; which now makes it much more difficult for the US or Israel to intervene militarily. The deal also gives the regime some degree of status as a legal authority with which outside powers must negotiate. That weakens the hand of the opposition; but, it could open a door for an international diplomatic intervention to achieve &mdash; firstly &mdash; a cease fire. and perhaps then something more substantive.
:* '''Brown''': There is no appetite for the kinds of expensive and very hard interventions [''undertaken''] in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, in any case, the US and its allies don't have the money to fund this, and their publics evidently feel no case has been made yet for getting involved. People are weary of the endless arguments in the {{w|Middle-East}}, and feel that they should now be left to deal with their own issues. China, in particular, has tried to maintain as strong a [...] network of benign support in the region as possible, while avoiding getting sucked into problems. There is no viable opposition in Syria that would make it easier to justify intervention; and, no easy way of seeing how this tragic civil war is going to be easily ended.
:* '''Farhi''': Syria has become the arena for a proxy war among regional and extra-regional players and yes its civil war will not end until all key players and their external supporters develop a political will to end the conflict. For the conflict to end, the bankers feeding the conflict should agree to stop funding it. 
:* '''Mitter''': Yes. But, it will depend on Russia, China, and the US, being able to come up with a compromise solution. That looks [''to be''] a long way off.

=== Iran ===

[[File:FSA soldiers in truck moving.jpg|thumb|right|250px|{{w|Free Syrian Army}} soldiers involved in the civil war. {{image source|{{w|Voice of America}}}}]]
{{WNIQ|Wikinews}} For many years, Syria has been considered Iran's "closest ally". What vested interest does the Iranian government have in keeping Bashar al-Assad in power? 
:*'''Kamrava''': These interests are primarily strategic, with both countries sharing common interests in relation to {{w|Lebanon}} &mdash; particularly the {{w|Hezbollah}} group &mdash; and [as] deterrence against {{w|Israel}}[''i intervention'']. 
:*'''Martel''': Iran's interests align very closely with that of Russia in supporting Syria and opposing the United States. Further, during this last week, {{w|Vladimir Putin|President Putin}} offered to help Iran build a second {{w|nuclear power|nuclear reactor}}. The policies of Russia, Iran, and Syria align quite closely; thus leading some &mdash; such as myself &mdash; to argue that we are seeing the rise of an "authoritarian axis" of states, whose policies are coordinated.
:*'''Posch''': First, Syria was Iran's only ally against {{w|Saddam Hussein}} and [''an''] indispensable partner in Lebanon since the early 1980s.
[[File:PYD supporters.PNG|thumb|left|250px|{{w|Kurds|Kurdish}} supporters of Syria's {{w|Democratic Union Party (Syria|Democratic Union Party|DUP}} in {{w|Afrin}}. {{image source|Scott Bobb}}]]
:: Even before the fall of Saddam in 2003, Iran reinterpreted the basically pragmatic cooperation in the field of intelligence and security. Ever since Syria was part of a so called "axis of resistance" consisting of Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, {{w|Hamas}} and {{w|Islamic Jihad Organization|Islamic Jihad}}, the sole common strategic denominator of these different actors is hostility against Israel, which is always depicted as an aggressor against whom the Muslims should resist &mdash; hence, the [designation as an] "axis of resistance". Of course, forming an alliance 'officially against Israel' serves another purpose too: to take a stand against {{w|Saudi Arabia}} without naming it. Much of the current crisis in Syria has to do with this scheme.
:*'''Farhi''': Syria supported Iran during the {{w|Iran–Iraq war}}; and, that dynamic forged a long-standing relationship between the two countries that includes economic, political, and military cooperation. In more recent years, Iran, Syria and Hezbollah have self-identified as [''an''] axis of resistance against Israeli&ndash;American involvement in the region. Despite this, Iran initially mostly followed the Russian lead in the Syria. However as other regional players &mdash; such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, as well as extra-regional players such as the United States &mdash; began to see, and articulate the weakening of, the Assad regime as a first step to the weakening of Iran, this enhanced Iran's threat perception, and gave it [''an''] incentive for further involvement in support of Assad.
<hr />
{{WNIQ|Wikinews}} Do you think Iranian support for the Syrian government is a way of standing up against UN sanctions imposed on them, and opposing {{w|American imperialism}}?
:* '''Kamrava''': No. Iranian&ndash;Syrian relations are rooted in common strategic interests rather than in assumptions about US imperialism, or the role of the UN sanctions. 
:* '''Martel''': Both Iran and Syria share a strategic interest in undermining the influence of the US and the West.
:* '''Posch''': Definitely not. The sanctions track is a different one, checking American "imperialism" &mdash; as you call it &mdash; is, of course. one aim.
:* '''Farhi''': As has become evident in the past few weeks, the primary interactive dynamic regarding the Syrian imbroglio is being played out mostly in terms of US&ndash;Russian rivalry; and, Iran is following the Russian lead.
<hr />
{{WNIQ|Wikinews}} The UN has "overwhelmingly" confirmed use of chemical weapons in Syria. Do you think both sides have used chemical weapons?
[[File:Mehran Kamrava - Pub photo.jpeg|thumb|left|160px|File photo of interviewee Mehran Kamrava. {{image source|Mehran Kamrava}}]]
:* '''Kamrava''': It is undeniable that chemical weapons were used in Syria. But, I have not yet seen conclusive evidence for the responsibility of the use of chemical gas by one side or another. Until valid evidence is made available &mdash; proving who used chemical weapons &mdash; affixing blame to either the government forces, or to one of the fractious rebel groups, is only a matter of speculation.
:* '''Martel''':  I remain skeptical that anyone other than the Syrian government used chemical weapons. It is widely accepted that the Syrian government was behind the use of chemical weapons.
:* '''Posch''': I think the Report is quite clear on that.
:* '''Farhi''': I &mdash;as an academic, with no access to on the ground information &mdash; am in no position to know whether both sides have used chemical weapons. 
<hr /> 
{{WNIQ|Wikinews}} Would you agree that part of Iran's vested interest in Syria remaining under al-Assad is bound to two factors: religion and strategy?
[[File:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Former {{w|President of Iran}} {{w|Mahmoud Ahmedinejad}} who stepped down earlier this year. {{image source|Russian Presidential Press and Information Office}}]]
:* '''Kamrava''': No, I do not agree. Iran's "vested interest in Syria remaining under al-Assad" is [''a''] product only of Iran's strategic calculations.
:: While foreign policies anywhere may be expressed &mdash; and justified &mdash; through slogans and ideological rhetoric, they are based on strategic considerations and calculations. Despite common, journalistic misconceptions, religion has not played a role in Iranian foreign policy; whether in relation to Syria or anywhere else.
:* '''Martel''': Iran's vested interest in Syria is entirely geo-strategic. Iran's support [''for''] Syria is designed to undermine US power and influence. For Iran, no policy objective is more important than to possess {{w|nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons}}. When the U.S. declared a "redline" if Syria "used or moved" chemical weapons, and then backed away from that redline, it is likely that Iran's leadership drew one principal conclusion:
::: the US redline on Iran's nuclear program is in doubt, the US commitment to preventing Iran from possessing nuclear weapons is in doubt,
:: and that Iran likely will test US resolve.
:: In strategic terms, doubts about the credibility of the US redline on Iran dwarfs any concerns about Syria's chemical weapons.
:: The belief in Iran &mdash; that the US may not be willing to prevent Iran from possessing nuclear weapons &mdash; could lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. It is difficult to exaggerate just how dangerous a nuclear-armed Iran is for regional and global security.
:*'''Posch''': No, it is strategy, and perhaps ideology. Religion doesn't play too much [of] a role, even though the conflict has been thoroughly "sectarianised". This happened a few years back when the Saudis baptised (if that term is appropriate) the "axis of resistance" to "shiite crescent". The domination of the {{w|Syrian Baath Party}} by members of one sect plays no role in Iran's security equation. Attempts to convert Syrian {{w|Alevites}} to Mainstream Shiites are initiatives of some individual {{w|Ayatollahs}}. I have already mentioned the strategic aspect, [''an''] axis of resistance against Israel and Saudi Arabia simultaneously; to this I would add Iranian concern over the {{w|Kurds|Kurdish}} issue.
:* '''Farhi''': The Assad government is a secular government, and Iran's relationship with it has nothing to do with religion or religious affinities. The relationship is a complex one &mdash; and, as mentioned before &mdash; forged as a strategic bond during the Iran&ndash;Iraq War, when Saddam's regime was deemed aggressively expansionist by both regimes.
<hr />
{{WNIQ|Wikinews}}  Iran is home to the world's most populous {{w|Shia Islam|Shiite Muslim}} nation. The Syrian rebels are {{w|Sunni Islam|Sunni}}. Could this be a Sunni vs. Shiite alignment in the {{w|Middle East}}? 
[[File:Farhi.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|File photo of interviewee Farideh Farhi. {{image source|Farideh Farhi}}]]
:* '''Kamrava''': No. While sectarianism may be the lens through which some of the Syrian rebels see their fight against the government, ultimately the contest is over state power and capitalizing on opportunities created by the Arab uprisings in general; and, the Syrian civil war in particular. Sunni&ndash;Shia 'alignments' have nothing to do with it.
:* '''Posch''': Usually, the Sunni&ndash;Shia divide is something Iranians and Saudis play up in order to put pressure on one another; usually, they were also able to deescalate. Syria, however, is the game-changer &mdash; for the simple reason that nobody believes the Saudis would control the post {{w|Al-Qaeda}} Networks in Syria. What Iran fears is an increase of the most-radical Sunni anti-shiism, the so called takfiris, spilling over onto Iranian territory.
:* '''Farhi''': The Sunni governments in the region are working hard to use sectarian tensions as an instrument to fan popular resentments, in the region, towards Shi'ite Iran. But, the rivalry is actually political; and, has to do with the fears rivals have of what they consider &mdash; I think wrongly &mdash; to be Iran's hegemonic aspirations in the region.
:: Sectarianism is an instrument for shaping regional rivalries, and not the source of problems, in the region.

{{WNIQ|Wikinews}} Russia is one of Syria's biggest arms suppliers. Do you think this means Russia's interest lies in economic benefit, as opposed to the humanitarian crisis?

:* '''Blank''': Although Russia sells Syria weapons, Russia's main interest has nothing to do with humanitarianism or economics.
:: Rather, its main interests are to force the US to accept Russia as an equal &mdash; so that {{w|Moscow}} has an effective veto power over any further American actions of a strategic nature there and elsewhere &mdash; and second, to restore Russia's standing as an indispensable great power in the Middle East without whom nothing strategic can be resolved.
:: It should be noted that in neither case is Russia actively interested in finding solutions to existing problems.  Rather, it seeks to create a bloc of pro-Russian, anti-American states and maintain simmering conflicts at their present level while weakening US power.
[[File:Bill Martel Photo downscaled.jpg|thumb|right|160px|File photo of interviewee William Martel. {{image source|William Martel}}]]
:* '''Martel''': Russia's principal interests in Syria are twofold. First, Moscow's support is geopolitical in design. It is designed precisely to undermine and weaken American influence in the Middle East and globally. The extent to which Russia can undermine American influence directly helps to bolster Russia's influence. For now, Russia is such a vastly diminished power &mdash; both politically, economically, militarily, and technologically &mdash; that Russian policymakers are pursuing policies they believe will help to reverse Russia's strategic decline.
::Second, Syria is Russia's strongest ally in the region, if not the world, while Syria is the home to Russia's only foreign naval base.
:* '''Farhi''': Syria is Russia's only solid strategic ally in the Middle East. Syria, in effect, is a Russian client. Russia's interests lie in maintaining that foothold, and perhaps extending it.
:: It also has a concern regarding the civil war in Syria spawning what it considers to be extremist Islamist activities, which it has had to contend with within its own borders. 
<hr />
[[File:Stephen Blank - Pub photo.jpeg|thumb|left|160px|File photo of interviewee Stephen Blank. {{image source|Stephen Blank}}]]
{{WNIQ}} Do you believe Russia distrusts US intentions in the region &mdash; in the sense of countering the West on regime change?

:* '''Blank''': It is clear that Russia not only does not trust US interests and judgment in the Middle East, it regards Washington as too-ready to use force to unseat regimes it does not like and believes these could lead to wars; more importantly, to the attempt to overthrow the present Russian government. That is critical to understanding Moscow's staunch support for Assad.
:* '''Martel''': Russia's policymakers understand that American and Russia interests directly diverge. Russia seeks to undermine US geopolitical influence, and increase its own. It is using its support of the Syrian regime to accomplish that objective. American interests, by contrast, are largely to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons.
:: Appallingly, Russia is supporting Syria despite the fact that all evidence points to Syria's use of chemical weapons.
::One would think that American policymakers would be more critical of Russia; which is directly supporting a regime that used poison gas to slaughter its own men, women, and children.
:* '''Farhi''': It is less about trust and more about protection of geopolitical interests and prevention of even more dire consequences if Assad goes. It is true that Russia feels that the United States and {{w|NATO}} went beyond the mandate afforded to them by the UN Security Council in going after regime change in Libya.
:: However, Russia's geopolitical, and economic, interests in Syria are much more important; and, the relationship between the two countries [''is''] much deeper.
<hr />
{{WNIQ}} The Russian Government accepts that chemical weapons have been used in Syria. How does it come to claim that the rebels are behind the attacks even though it is widely accepted that the al-Assad government has stocks of weapons?
[[File:16-tube multiple launch rocket.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A {{w|BM-14}} {{w|multiple rocket launcher}}, similar to the type likely to have launched the M-14 munitions found by UN Inspectors on August 26. {{image source|Vlad}}]]

:* '''Blank''': It [''Russia''] simply intends to defend Assad to the hilt; and is hardly unwilling to lie &mdash; especially as its intelligence service is notorious for fabricating mendacious and biased threat assessments, and is not under any form of effective democratic control.
:* '''Martel''': Russia's claims that Syrian rebels were behind the chemical weapon attacks is, frankly, inexplicable. Worse, Russia's basic credibility is undermined by such statements.
:* '''Farhi''': Russia claims Syria has presented it [''with''] evidence that the rebels have used chemical weapons; and Russia, in turn, has given the evidence to the UNSC. It has also called the UN report one-sided and biased. The bottom line is &mdash; the claim that the opposition to the Assad regime is at least as culpable in the violence being committed in Syria, opens the path for Russia to continue calling for a political solution [which] brings to the table all parties to the conflict in Syria, including Assad and his supporters; something the multi-voiced opposition has so far refused.
<hr />
{{WNIQ}} Would you agree that Russia's vested interest in Syria remaining under al-Assad is bound to two factors: economics and ideology?

:* '''Blank''': As I said above, Russia's interest in Assad is bound to two geopolitical factors: maintaining the security of its regime; and, equally important, weakening America in the Middle-East &mdash; if not globally &mdash; and ensuring that Russia's great power status is  thereby ensured.
:* '''Martel''': Russia's vested interest in protecting Syria's al-Assad is driven by geopolitics.
:: To support Assad, is to counter US policy and influence; which is precisely what Putin's government seeks to accomplish. In many senses, Russia's support for Syria is entirely secondary to Russia's strategy of reversing its two-decade long decline in every measure of power. With its weak economy, dependence on petroleum for half of its national income, and increasingly authoritarian government, Russia has relatively little to offer the world &mdash; other than to oppose the United States as part of its strategy of reversing its decline.
:: While Russia's geopolitical influence clearly increased as a result of its support for Syria, its long-term economic prospects remain quite dim.
:* '''Farhi''': It is economic as well as political.
:: Syria is a customer of Russian arms and goods; hosting a naval supply base in {{w|Tartus}}. But, as mentioned above, Russia has serious concerns regarding what comes after Assad. For Russia, the current regime is better than chaos or control by Islamists.

Bolivian president announces legal action over Obama's 'crimes against humanity'
{{correction|date=October 4, 2013|explanation=The last paragraph of this article should say "President Maduro" rather than "President Morales".  We apologize for the error.}}
{{date|September 21, 2013}}
{{Crime and law}}
The [[Bolivia]]n President [[Evo Morales]] announced Thursday he will file legal charges against the [[United States]] President [[Barack Obama]] for {{w|crimes against humanity}}. President Morales announced he was preparing litigation after [[Venezuela]]n President {{w|Nicolás Maduro|Nicholas Maduro}}'s plane was allegedly denied entry into U.S. airspace over [[Puerto Rico]].
[[File:Morales 20060113 02.jpg|thumb|left|180px|File photo of Evo Morales.  {{image|{{w|Agência Brasil}}}}]][[File:Official portrait of Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Official portrait of Barack Obama. {{image|Pete Souza}}]]
President Morales called Obama a "criminal" violating {{w|international law}}. Morales called an emergency meeting of the {{w|Community of Latin American and Caribbean States}} (CELAC), made up of 33 member states including [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]] and [[Chile]], and encouraged member states to remove their ambassadors from the U.S. to show their solidarity. He asked {{w|Bolivarian Alliance}} member states to boycott the next [[United Nations]] meeting, to be held in [[New York City|New York]] on September 24. He also said the U.S. had pursued a policy of "intimidation" and have a history of blockading presidential flights. 

In July this year, the Bolivian presidential aircraft was prevented from landing in [[Portugal]] to refuel, allegedly at the request of the U.S. administration. After [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[France]] each banned the aircraft from entering their airspace, it was ultimately forced to land in [[Austria]]. Here, the plane was boarded as part of the search for U.S. fugitive {{w|Edward Snowden}}. Several [[Latin America]]n heads of state promptly condemned the actions.

President Evo Morales is in his second presidential term after first being elected in 2005. He campaigned on the promise of alleviating Bolivia's crippling poverty &mdash; Bolivia was Latin America's poorest nation at the time he was elected &mdash; and is Bolivia's first indigenous leader. He became internationally recognisable for the striped jumper he wore while meeting with high level dignitaries, including kings and presidents, around the world. His actions as President have included halving his own salary and those of his ministers, seizing Bolivia's gas and oil reserves, and redistributing the nation's unused countryside to the poor.

President Morales had been bound for bilateral talks in [[China]]. He maintains he will not be prevented from attending them.

Wikinews interviews specialists on South Korea military parade
{{date|October 6, 2013}}
[[File:ROKdrillteam.jpg|thumb|right|250px|File photo of South Korean military troops. {{image source|US Military}}]]
On Tuesday, [[South Korea]] staged a huge military parade to mark its armed forces' 65th anniversary in a display of long-range missiles considered a direct threat to [[North Korea]]. 11,000 troops and 190 different weapons systems were on display in the parade.  ''Wikinews'' interviewed several specialists about the parade's possible significance.

== Interviewees ==
''Wikinews'' interviewed:
*'''''Robert Kelly''''', Associate Professor of International Relations {{w|Pusan National University}} (PNU) in South Korea
*'''''Margaret Kosal''''', Assistant Professor at the {{w|Sam Nunn School of International Affairs}} at the {{w|Georgia Institute of Technology}} in {{w|Atlanta}}, {{w|Georgia (US state)|Georgia}}
*'''''{{w|Gari Ledyard}}''''', Professor Emeritus of Korean Studies at {{w|Columbia University}}, {{w|New York}}
*'''''Sue Mi Terry''''', Senior Research Scholar at the {{w|Weatherhead East Asian Institute}}, Columbia University in New York
*'''''Young-hae Chi''''', Instructor in Korean at the {{w|University of Oxford}}, {{w|England}}
*'''''Seungkwon You''''', Associate Teaching Professor of Korean Studies at the {{w|University of Missouri}}

== ''Wikinews'' Q&amp;A ==
{{missing image|File:Robert Kelly File Photo.JPG|thumb|left|130px| File photo of interviewee Robert Kelly. {{image source|Robert Kelly}}}}
{{WNIQ|Wikinews}} What is your job role?
::'''Kelly''': I am a Professor of International Relations at PNU.

::'''Kosal''': I am an Assistant Professor in the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at the Georgia Institute of Technology, more commonly known as "Georgia Tech." I also direct the Emerging Technology and Security Program and the Biological and Chemical Nonproliferation and Counterterrorism Program.

::'''Ledyard''': I retired from my professorship at Columbia thirteen years ago; since then I've had no role. When I was active there since 1964, I taught Korean history and culture, emphasizing the traditional periods of Korea's earlier history. In those years I wrote a few articles on contemporary political issues but my research has been almost all in Korea's past.

::'''Terry''': I am a Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University's Weatherhead East Asian Institute.

::'''Chi''': I have been teaching Korean studies at Oxford University. I am specialized in international relations of the Far East and particularly North Korean human rights and refugee issues. I worked as an analyst of security issues at the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses in Seoul between 1983 and 1988 authoring a number of policy papers for the South Korean Government.

::'''You''': Associate Teaching Professor of Korean Studies teaching Korean Unification, Korean film, Korean society [at the University of Missouri].

<hr />
{{WNIQ}} Is the display of {{w|cruise missile|cruise missiles}} and other weapons in a military parade by South Korea in direct response to repeated similar North Korean parades?
::'''Kelly''':  Yes. I don't actually think these sorts of demonstrations are proper in a democracy. Liberal states should not really be flashing their hardware in a strutting, provocative way like this. This is the sort of thing Putin would do. But SK's [South Korea's] case is rather exceptional. NK [North Korea] tries pretty regularly to bully SK, and as its nuclear and missile programs advance, SK deterrence become ever more important. So parades like this are a way of SK saying 'don't mess with us even though you have nukes.'
[[File:Park Geun-Hye meeting with Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|right|250px| {{W|President of South Korea|South Korean President}} {{w|Park Geun-Hye}} with {{w|America|United States}} {{w|President of the United States|President}} {{w|Barack Obama}}. {{image source|White House}}]]

::'''Kosal''': The "display" was multi-functional. It shows the modern, indigenous conventional military capabilities of the South Korean forces. It was also to credibly communicate &mdash; literally show to the North &mdash; possession of an adequate deterrent force, a force that is both capable and credible. The underlying capacity supports the newly announced bilateral tailored deterrence strategy between South Korea and the {{w|United States}}. The military parade served to transparently show, in a largely passive/non-offensive/non-reactionary  way, the capacity to follow through on that strategy that is directed at North Korea's offensive {{w|nuclear weapons}}, offensive {{w|chemical weapons}}, and offensive {{w|biological weapons}} programs rather than a more general deterrence strategy. There is much more to a tailored deterrence strategy, but that is one part of it. The specific declaratory policy highlights South Korea's responsibility to "continue to build reliable inter-operable response capabilities and to develop the Korean Air and Missile Defense system."  These are largely passive defense measures to minimize the effects of a North Korean offensive attack and to reduce vulnerability of South Korean forces and civilians. It's part of the overall strategic defense posture.

:: While not commonly observed in the US, parades like this are not atypical for East Asia, particularly in conjunction with significant anniversaries. In this case, the parade also marked the 65th anniversary of the Republic of Korea [South Korea] Armed Forces. In addition to the international visibility, it also serves South Korean domestic politics and advances {{w|President of South Korea|foreign=suppress|South Korean President}} {{w|Park Geun-hye}}'s own strong national security policies.

::'''Ledyard''': It could very well be, but I have no knowledge regarding it. It has long been routine for both Koreas to compete in the headlines.

::'''Terry''': President Park is trying to make it clear to the North that this time, under her watch, {{w|Seoul}} is now serious about responding to future provocations by the North.  South Korea's display of its missiles is meant to deter the North, to show the North that any provocation in the future would be met with strong retaliation.

::'''Chi''': The institution of the military parade has been a regular feature of the Armed Forces’ Day celebration in South Korea. Yet the display of the cruise missiles in the recent parade is designed to achieve specific purposes. One is obviously targeting at the North Korean regime as a warning for possible pre-emptive strikes on their conventional and nuclear missile sites. The other target is South Korean citizens who have been increasingly agitated about the possession of WMDs by its Northern counterpart and want to see some guarantee from their own government. Hence the parade is not only for displaying its military capabilities to its enemies but it is also playing a psychological game with its own people. Yet, {{w|Hyunmoo-3|Hyunmoo-3c}}, one of the cruise missiles displayed in the event, signals that the South Korean government’s perspective is no longer limited to the Korean peninsula. Hyunmoo-3c’s range of 1,500&nbsp;{{w|kilometer|km}} indicates that the Korean military oversees the entire Northeast Asian region as its strategic theatre. Such a wide strategic thinking is also behind the planned construction of the naval base in {{w|Jeju Island}}.

::'''You''': Not direct response. However, this parade has not been done for many years and resumed this year indicating [the] Park government would not tolerate any hostile action by North Korea.

<hr />
[[File:Young-Hae Chi.jpeg|thumb|left|130px| File photo of interviewee Young-hae Chi. {{image source|Young-hae Chi}}]]
{{WNIQ}} South Korea's President, Park Geun-hye, has warned of a "very grave" threat posed by North Korea. Would a military parade like this be more likely to encourage hostile behaviour?
::'''Kelly''': Not really, because NK already engages in so much hostile behavior it is hard to know how much more restraint SK show. My own sense is that SK demonstrates remarkable forbearance in the face of NK threats. If one thinks of how, e.g., the US or {{w|Israel}} would respond to such threats, SK looks downright gentle. So SK needs to signal both that it does not seek escalation, but also that it cannot be bullied. It's a tough balancing act, and this parade is to send that second message.

::'''Kosal''': Not necessarily. North Korean behavior is difficult to predict with any fidelity. The military parade, while it shows potential capacity, is a fundamentally passive (rather than active or reactive) form of behavior. Reinforces a consistent posture by the South Koreans and the US.

::'''Ledyard''': There is a sixty-year history of such back-and-forth with an impressive absence of active military conflict. It's tit for tat, and both sides either maintain the balance or one or the other loses face. It would take much more than a parade for actual conflict to erupt.

::'''Terry''': No, not in the long run although this kind of a military parade might provoke temporary, short-term hostile behavior by the North.  The North has never been ideological or suicidal.  Its chief goal always has been regime survival.  It knows if a war were to break out, it will definitively lose to South Korea.

::'''Chi''': The South Korean government has been implementing military parades since 1956, and as such it is unlikely to encourage or discourage hostile behaviour. 

::'''You''': Could be. North Korea already criticized [the] Park government about the recent parade and very bold move by the Park Government in negotiating family reunion and resuming of {{w|Mount Kumgang|Diamond Mountains}}. However, I do not believe that North Korea will take any hostile action since the US Secretary of State, {{w|John Kerry|Kerry}}, is proposing North Korea a peaceful dialogue.

<hr />
[[File:Dr Margaret Kosal.jpeg|thumb|right|130px| File photo of interviewee Margaret Kosal. {{image source|Margaret Kosal}}]]

{{WNIQ}} Does the presence of US Defence Secretary {{w|Chuck Hagel}} to this military parade show a further strengthening in the US&ndash;South Korea alliance?
::'''Kelly''': It does, but the Secretary's presence is more for the optics than substance. The US&ndash;Korean alliance was substantially strengthened about 4 years ago by the previous SK president. This is just a refresher that looks good on TV.

::'''Kosal''': Secretary of Defense Hagel's presence, along with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General {{w|Martin Dempsey}}, shows the commitment of the United States to support its ally. The United States remains committed to the transfer of operational control (OPCON) to the South Koreans for general defense of South Korea. The US is also strongly committed to limiting proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. Their presence reinforces that to the North Koreans as well as to the international community.

::'''Ledyard''': It is simple routine in the USA&ndash;{{w|Republic of Korea|ROK}} alliance. South Koreans depend on it and the US takes care to show support.

::'''Terry''': Yes, it further showcases the depth of {{w|Washington DC|Washington}}'s support for South Korea against any provocation from {{w|Pyongyang}}.

::'''Chi''': Certainly he is there to add symbolic strength to the alliance which tended to be weakened until recently. Behind his presence is the recent agreement to reconsider the planed transfer of the war-time operation control from the {{w|UN}}/US to the Korean army.  

::'''You''': US&ndash;South Korea alliance is strong but it is a bit more complicated since [the] US is supporting {{w|Japan}} in arming in naval forces to check {{w|China}}, which is a great concern for South Korea and [the] South Korean people.

{{WNIQ}} North Korea's rhetoric vows the repeated bolstering of its nuclear arsenal to what it calls US military threats. Do you think a military parade of this type backed by the US is likely to influence further hostility?
::'''Kelly''': No, because NK must be permanently hostile toward the US and SK anyway. NK has no reason to exist as a separate, poorer Korean state, just as the GDR [{{w|East Germany}}] had no post-{{w|Cold War|cold war}} reason to exist, unless SK and the US can be regularly described as the enemy. So NK doesn't want a war, but they certainly don't want a warm peace, as then NK then loses its ''{{wikt|raison d'être|anchor=English|raison d'etre}}''.

::'''Kosal''': No, North Korea and its leadership are responsible for its choices, which are the primary source of instability on the Korean peninsula with potential regional effects.

::'''Ledyard''': The "military threats" are more a reflection of North Korea's fears than any concrete threats. They are more for internal DPRK [North Korea] efforts to keep its own population in tune with government policies.

::'''Terry''': No.  I think it's important to remember Pyongyang's periodic provocations and its pursuit of nuclear arsenal are not reactions or self-defense measures against a threatening Seoul or Washington.  Incapable of competing with economically flourishing South Korea, the North relies on bolstering its nuclear arsenal and on military and political brinkmanship to make up ground.

::'''Chi''': The two Koreas do the military parade almost routinely. South Korea will have a similar parade again when there is a new government in five years. It is unlikely the kind of parade to influence further hostility.

::'''You''': No, this is just symbolic. As a matter of fact, North Korea is very anxious to escape from the current gridlock and [the] US and South Korea do not give them plenty of reasons to go to the negotiating table.

[[File:Sue-Terry.jpg|thumb|right|130px| File photo of interviewee Sue Mi Terry. {{image source|Sue Mi Terry}}]]
{{WNIQ}} Do you think it is likely that North and South Korea may at some point in the near future be engaged in direct military action with each other?
::'''Kelly''':  Minor skirmishes are possible, indeed likely, given the border confusion in the {{w|Yellow Sea}}. But a major conflict is highly unlikely, no matter what bluster comes from NK. The NKs would lose such a war, decisively in fact, and the NK elite would face the hangman in the South afterward. NK is much too far behind to win. So full-scale conflict is very unlikely.

::'''Kosal''': I hope not.

::'''Ledyard''': No. A year or two ago there was a naval incident that occurred in the {{w|Yellow Sea|West Sea}}, but both sides separated quickly, although the North shelled {{w|Yeonpyeong Island|an island}} claimed by both the DPRK and the ROK.  Neither side has anything to gain from any such incident.

::'''Terry''': The North's latest tactic &mdash; to return to diplomacy after provoking Seoul and Washington earlier this year &mdash; does not mean that the North has abandoned its timeworn brinkmanship strategy nor that it has shifted its nuclear policy.  The North is likely to pursue more aggressive action down the road, attempting to ratchet up another sense of crisis, if it determines that its current peace ploy is not getting the concessions it seeks from Seoul.   But while the North may provoke Seoul again with border skirmishes, or another missile or nuclear test, I think it will avoid direct military action with Seoul that will escalate to an all-out conflict.  Again, Pyongyang will not risk outright hostilities that will lead to an all-out war.

::'''Chi''': You can never exclude possible exchanges of military actions within a limited range. At the time of North Korean attack on {{w|Yeonpyeong Island}} in November 2011, the South Korean Government made an official pledge to retaliate against any future military actions by North Korea. The government will face grave political consequences if it fails to live up to its own words. There is always a possibility of direct military actions but they will be more or less contained to a local level. 

::'''You''': No, I would not think so. North Korea is more desperate to engage in a dialogue with South Korea and [the] US but they look for justification to go to the table. However, [the] Park government and US would not be simply welcoming them to the negotiating table. When they negotiate, they would be not generous or lenient to take all the North Korean offers.

{{WNIQ}} This parade has been described as an Anti-North deterrence, do you think this will act as such?
::'''Kelly''': Yes. NK is moving more rapidly toward nuclearization and missilization than many had expected. NK pretty clearly has no intention of de-nuclearizing. That is simply not going to happen no matter how many SK and US political figures demand it. So now, SK must show that it can keep up and match, if not outrace, the NKs. This is why there is so much focus now on SK missile and BMD capabilities.

::'''Kosal''': Yes.

::'''Ledyard''': Again, nearly sixty years of history supports the view that neither side has any interest in actual military conflict.

::'''Terry''': To some degree, yes.  It's good to remind the North of Seoul's capabilities, although as I said before, {{w|Kim Jong-un}}, like his father and grandfather before him, already knows any all-out conflict would result in the destruction of his regime.   

::'''Chi''': South Korea’s possession of cruise missiles and other advanced technology such as {{w|Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones}} had been an open secret. There is nothing new about this parade, hence little deterrence effect added to the existing military posture.

::'''You''': No, it would not act as such. Rather, it has domestic purpose to draw [the] South Korean public to concern more about South Korean military and national security in general. For the past decade, [the] South Korean public have been very critical of the role of military in society. Certainly, the Park government wants to rectify it.

Iran agrees to expanded monitoring of nuclear sites
{{date|November 12, 2013}}
{{Iran}}
[[File:Amano.png|thumb|left|File photo of the UN nuclear chief, Yukiya Amano {{image credit|International Students’ Committee}}]]
[[Iran]] agreed on Monday to allow the [[United Nations]] (UN) increased access to nuclear facilities according to a government announcement on state television. UN monitors will gain access to a heavy water reactor still being built, as well as the largest uranium reactor in Iran.

The government announcement also stated that Iran would clarify its plans to build new uranium-enrichment facilities and technologies.

According to the UN nuclear chief, {{w|Yukiya Amano}}, the agreement will be put in place within the next three months.  He said that Iran had agreed to "implement practical measures" to aid the UN inspectors. 

This is the first deal that Iran has made with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) since 2007. The announcement came after talks between Iran and world leaders from the United States, France, China, Russia and Germany in Geneva, over the amount of access that the IAEA should have to Iranian nuclear sites. The negotiations stalled, but are set to resume next week.

The IAEA has been pushing to inspect Iran's nuclear facilities for a decade, currently having access to only 17. The Iranian government continues to assert that their nuclear program is peaceful, and wants the UN to lift {{w|Sanctions against Iran|sanctions}}.

British Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] said in Parliament on Monday that "It's very important for the Iranian authorities to understand that the pressure will be there for greater sanctions... unless an agreement is reached on these matters."

French Foreign Minister {{w|Laurent Fabius}} acknowledged that the agreement reached on Monday is a good sign for diplomacy, but also said that more work needed to be done. "We are not far from an agreement with the Iranians, but we are not there yet," he said on {{w|Europe 1 radio}}.

Pickens County, South Carolina sheriff refuses to lower US flag to honor Mandela
{{date|December 9, 2013}}
{{United States}}
[[File:Pickens County Courthouse, Pickens (Pickens County, South Carolina).JPG|thumb|left|File photo of the Pickens County Courthouse {{image credit|[[:commons:User:KudzuVine|KudzuVine]]}}]]
On Friday, the sheriff of {{w|Pickens County}}, [[South Carolina]] Rick Clark refused to lower the flag to honor [[Nelson Mandela]] after [[US]] President [[Barack Obama]] made an executive order that all US flags to be flown at half mast in honor of Mandela until sunset today.

On Friday, Clark posted to [[Facebook]] to explain his decision saying, "I usually don't post political items, but today is different. I received this notification today, 'As a mark of respect for the memory of Nelson Mandela, the President orders that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff effective immediately until sunset, December 9, 2013'&thinsp;".

He went on to say in the same post, "Nelson Mandela did great things for his country and was a brave man but he was not an AMERICAN!!! The flag should be lowered at our Embassy in S. Africa, but not here. Our flag is at half staff today for a Deputy in the low country who died going to help his fellow Deputy. He deserves the honor. I have ordered that the flag here at my office back up after tomorrow's mourning of {{w|National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day|Pearl Harbor Day}}!"

CNN affiliate WHNS quoted Clark as saying, "It's just my simple opinion that the flag should only be lowered to half-staff for Americans who sacrificed for their country. [...] I have no problem lowering it in South Africa in their country but not for our country. It should be the people who have sacrificed for our country."

According to ''{{w|Fox News}}'', the US President cannot require US flag lowering at the local level. According to ''{{w|CNN}}'' in an article published yesterday, presidents generally restrict requests for lowering the flag to major national figures, US governors, and foreign dignitaries.

Presidents of the United States have previously ordered the flag lowered in honor of non-Americans including [[Pope John Paul II]] who died in 2005, {{w|Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein}} of [[Jordan]] who died in 1999, [[Israel|Israeli]] Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] who died in 1995,  [[Egypt|Egyptian]] President {{w|Anwar Sadat}} who died in 1981, British Prime Minister {{w|Winston Churchill}} who died in 1965, and [[United Nations]] Secretary-General {{w|Dag Hammarskjold}} who died in 1961.  While President Obama expressed condolences regarding the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] upon her death earlier this year, he did not issue an executive order that flags be lowered in her honour.

Rebels take over South Sudan oil regions
{{date|December 22, 2013}}

{{South Sudan}}
Rebel troops under the command of {{w|Riek Machar}}, former vice president of [[South Sudan]], today stated they now control a number of areas of the country including the oil-rich {{w|Unity (state)|Unity State}} which borders [[Sudan]]. Government troops are attempting to take back {{w|Bor}}, the capital of the state of {{w|Jonglei}}.
[[File:Al-Wahda Map.svg|thumb|left|Location of Unity State within South Sudan.  {{image|[[Commons:User:Ivan25|Ivan25]]}}]]
In [[Juba]], reportedly at least 500 people were killed in the last week. The [[US]] military said three US military aircraft — {{w|CV-22 Osprey|CV-22 Ospreys}} — were attacked by the rebel troops around Bor, and four US soldiers were injured and taken to [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] for treatment. At a [[United Nations]] facility in {{w|Akobo}}, an attack killed two [[India]]n peacekeepers and at least eleven civilians on Thursday.

Since South Sudan's 2011 independence from Sudan, ethnic conflicts have caused hundreds of deaths.

World leaders have reacted to the violence. UN General Secretary [[Ban Ki-Moon]] said: "I demand that all political, military and militia leaders stop hostilities and end the violence against the civilians. I call on them to do everything in their power to ensure that their followers hear their message loud and clear."

US President [[Barack Obama]] said "any effort to seize power through the use of military force will result in the end of longstanding support from the United States and the international community".

Indonesian authorities report refugee boats pushed back by Australian Navy
{{correction|date=January 21, 2014|explanation=This article describes the asylum seekers' vessels as "ships", whereas the sources indicate they were boats.  We apologize for the error.}}
{{date|January 13, 2014}}
{{Indonesia}}
[[File:Christmas_Island_and_Rote_Island.png|thumb|left|Christmas Island (left), Rote Island (right). {{Image source|OpenStreetMap}}]]
The {{W|Royal Australian Navy}} {{w|sister=wikt|tow|anchor=Verb|towed}} back arriving asylum seekers to {{W|Rote Island}}, [[Indonesia]], after claiming {{W|Christmas Island}} destination, {{W|Indonesian National Police}} reported Monday of last week. Last Thursday, [[Australia]]n Prime Minister {{W|Tony Abbott}} supported lack of transparency on the issue.

Indonesian police found the two ships reportedly forcibly towed back from Australia on December 19, and on January 6 after being towed on {{W|New Year's Day}}. A self-identified [[Sudan]]ese asylum seeker from one of the boats reported the Navy ship numbers, identifying them as {{W|HMAS Parramatta (FFH 154)|HMAS ''Parramatta''}} and {{W|HMAS Glenelg (ACPB 96)|HMAS ''Glenelg''}}, and said the refugees were denied access to navigation tools during the duration of the route and abandoned in sea in the middle of the night. Commenters called such practice "{{wikt|pushback|push-backs}}", "tow-backs", "turn-backs".

Police chief Hidayat Rote Island, speaking to Fairfax Media, said the second boat was adrift: "They were rescued by the locals, because the boat engines were dead. The boat now is wreckage, near some reefs." 

The Australian government had also planned to purchase additional lifeboats for refugee expulsion from Australian waters, Fairfax Media reported.

Australian government originally had no response, but after protests by {{w|Australian Labor Party|Labor}} and the {{w|Australian Greens|Greens}}, Tony Abbott commented. Last Thursday, he supported lack of transparency on the issue by saying "I'd rather be criticised a bit for being a bit of a closed book on the issue, and actually stop the boats. I'm pleased to say that it's now several weeks since we've had a boat, and the less we talk about operational details on the water, the better when it comes to stopping the boats."

Defence Force chief David Hurley also claimed professional behaviour of board officers and the Navy when handling arriving refugees boats.

{{W|Indonesian National Armed Forces}} chief General Moeldoko said according to the {{w|Jakarta Post}}, and an {{W|Australian Defence Force}} spokesperson confirmed, that they agreed on the push-backs approach mid-December with no further comment; with Mr Abbot calling the relationship "very strong", while Indonesia's legal and security affairs minister {{W|Djoko Suyanto}} and foreign affairs minister {{W|Marty Natalegawa}} both disapproved of the approach.  General Moeldoko reportedly later said the media had misreported him.

The [[United Nations]] {{W|United Nations Refugee Agency|Refugee Agency}} (UNRA) was seeking explanation from the Australian government, it reported in a press briefing this Saturday. The UNRA spokesperson, Babar Baloch, raised legal concerns by saying that "Any such approach would raise significant issues and potentially could place Australia in breach of its obligations under the {{W|Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|Refugee Convention}} and international law. If people who are in need for international protection seek a country's safety, then they must be allowed to go through a process which helps to determine if these people are in need."

Marke, another self-identified [[Somalia|Somali]] asylum seeker, claimed earlier similar treatment, on December 10: that the Australian Navy &mdash; HMAS ''Parramatta'' and {{W|HMAS Maitland (ACPB 88)|HMAS ''Maitland''}} &mdash; had claimed Christmas Island destination, towed his boat for several days, and subsequently dropped at an undisclosed location.

Nepal's King Gyanendra cracks down on protests; 3 dead
{{date|April 21, 2006}}

[[Nepal]]'s King [[w:Gyanendra|Gyanendra]] deployed lethal force against protestors in Kathmandu on Thursday as a general strike and pro-democracy protest spread through Nepal threatening the future of the monarchy.

Government forces fired on protesters in the Kathmandu neighborhood of Kalanki, killing three people and injuring more than 100, according to officials at two city hospitals.  Two of those killed appeared to have been shot in the head by live bullets.

Kathmandu was under a curfew from 2 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time on April 20.  Non-governmental organizations such as the United Nations and the Red Cross were denied permission to move through the city during the curfew, and journalists were also denied curfew passes.  The United Nations Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights called the move a "clear violation" of their agreement with the Nepali government.

The curfew was reportedly extended until 3 a.m. local time Friday.  Protestors intend to continue protests on Friday.

Gyanendra assumed direct rule in February 2005, citing the failure of political parties to control a Maoist insurgency that has killed 13,000 people.  He has pledged free elections by April 2007, but an alliance of political parties has demanded he relinquish power to an all-party government immediately.

The protests have touched all areas of Nepalese society.  As an example, a peaceful protest meeting called by the [[w:Nepal Bar Association|Nepal Bar Association]] was fired upon by Nepalese police on April 13, 2006. About 1500 people took part in the protest which took place at Babarmahal in [[w:Kathmandu|Kathmandu]]. 50 were reportedly injured in the firing. Nepal Bar Association President Shambu Thampa was one of the casualties. It is not clear at this time whether the police used rubber, or live bullets. After the protest, tear gas shells were used to disperse the crowd. The authorities reportedly detained 72 people.

Later that day, around 100 people were arrested at a rally in a stadium at Maitighar. Most of those detained were associated with the Association of International NGOs (AIN).

International Paralympic Committee comments on Russian adherence to Olympic Truce
{{Sports}}
{{date|March 3, 2014}}
[[File:The Olympic Truce Wall.jpg|thumb|left|The Olympic Truce wall at the 2012 Summer Paralympics {{image credit|[[:w:USer:P.Kurmelis|P.Kurmelis]]}}]]
In a response published Saturday by [[The Associated Press]], the [[International Paralympic Committee]] commented on [[Russia]]n adherence to the {{w|Olympic truce|Olympic Truce}} in regards to the country's actions in the [[Ukraine]], saying "As with situations around the world, we hope a peaceful resolution can be found in the spirit of the Olympic Truce, which has covered the Paralympic Games since 2006. [...] We want the story here to be the great festival of sport that has already taken place in Sochi and will continue now that athletes are arriving for the start of the Winter Paralympics."

In the past few days, Russian troops entered the Ukrainian [[Crimea]] and took control of a number of strategic locations, including an airport and a regional parliament. <!-- http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/a-deeply-concerned-obama-warns-russia-against-action-in-crimea/2014/03/01/c56ca34c-a111-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html --> Yesterday, Russian forces surrounded a Crimean Ukrainian military base.<!-- http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10671580/Uneasy-standoff-between-Ukrainian-and-Russia-troops-in-Crimea.html -->

While the Russian-hosted Olympic Games officially ended on February 23, the Olympic period officially concludes on March 16 at the closing ceremony for the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]].<!-- assuming date of Olympic Games closing is common knowledge. http://www.sochi2014.com/en can be used for verification. -->

The Olympic Truce and its extension to the Paralympic Games is recognized by the [[United Nations]], who did so in A/65/270, para.7, an addition recognised by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in August 2010.

The Crimea region of the Ukraine is located less than 500 kilometers (less than 300 miles) away from [[Sochi]].  The  British Paralympic team have  said they are continuing to monitor the situation, but  has no current plans to make changes regarding their participation at the Games. The [[United States]] Paralympic team has said they haven't made any changes to their plans in response to the situation.

Yesterday, the [[United Kingdom]]'s {{w|Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister}} [[David Cameron]] said on [[Twitter]], "Because of the serious situation in Ukraine, @[[William Hague|WilliamJHague]] & I believe it would be wrong for UK Ministers to attend the Sochi Paralympics."

Canada has no plans to boycott Winter Paralympics
{{Sports}}

Yesterday the {{w|Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister}} {{w|John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird}} said there are no plans to boycott the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]] in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]] even as Canada takes other actions in response to [[Russia]]n military intervention in [[Crimea]], [[Ukraine]]. On Saturday Canadian {{w|Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister}} [[Stephen Harper]] also stated there were no plans to boycott the Games,<!-- http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-crisis-john-baird-condemns-russia-military-actions-1.2556858 and http://globalnews.ca/news/1181930/canada-considers-expelling-russian-ambassador-as-ukraine-crisis-continues/ and http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-crisis-john-baird-condemns-russia-military-actions-1.2556858 and http://globalnews.ca/news/1181270/harper-cabinet-ministers-meeting-to-address-situation-in-ukraine/ confirm the not boycott decision -->  set to start March 7.

Baird is quoted in as saying, "We don’t want the athletes to pay the price for this.[...] But politically... I don’t think there’s any way we’d want to have senior-level government leadership going there to somehow glorify Russia’s leadership." ''{{w|Toronto Star}}'' Sports Columnist Cathal Kelly published an editorial on Saturday saying [[Canada]] needs to boycott the Sochi Paralympics. 

Canada has already recalled its {{w|List of Ambassadors of Canada to Russia|ambassador to Russia}}. The Canadian government is considering expelling the {{w|Embassy of Russia in Ottawa|Russian ambassador}} from the country.  Yesterday, Harper said the country plans to boycott meetings leading up to the upcoming Russian-chaired [[G8]] summit.  He also said Canada was working with the [[United Nations]] to monitor the situation in the Ukraine, and is exploring the possibility of offering financial assistance to the country.

In an e-mail from {{w|Canadian Paralympic Committee}} CEO Karen O’Neill to Kelly, the organization refused to answer direct questions about any potential boycott of the Games.

Canada has previously boycotted an Olympics in Russia. In 1980, the country boycotted the {{w|1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics in Moscow}} because of the USSR invasion of [[Afghanistan]].  They were joined by a number of other countries including the [[United States]] and {{w|West Germany}}.<!-- http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/02/british-ministers-boycott-sochi-paralympics-russia-ukraine -->

Congolese refugee death toll climbs
{{date|March 29, 2014}}
{{Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
The {{w|Democratic Republic of Congo}} (DRC) government has confirmed that at least 251 Congolese refugees died after their boat capsized on {{w|Lake Albert}} on Saturday, en-route from {{w|Uganda}}.

[[File: Lake_Albert_(Uganda)_(NASA).jpg|thumb|left|NASA satellite image of Lake Albert showing the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda  {{image|[[Commons:User: Slawojar|Slawojar]]}}]]
Spokesman for the government, {{w|Lambert Mende}}, made the statement on Thursday: "It is with deep sorrow that we confirm the death of 251 of our compatriots who had boarded the boat from the Ugandan side of Lake Albert". 

{{QuoteRight|It is with deep sorrow that we confirm the death of 251 of our compatriots who had boarded the boat from the Ugandan side of Lake Albert.|4={{w|Lambert Mende}}}}
{{w|President Joseph Kabila}} declared three days of national mourning, which began on Thursday, described by Mende as a display of compassion and solidarity with the people of Congo.

The refugees were reportedly returning to the DRC, leaving {{w|Uganda}} voluntarily. 

Mende has claimed this is due to the "poor quality of welcome to which they were subjected," while the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ({{w|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR}}) has recently recorded an increase in Congolese refugees spontaneously returning to the DRC, following a military victory over rebels in the nation's east last November.

Tragedy struck the overcrowded vessel, when, as latest reports claim, it was carrying around three hundred people. 

Two boats were attempting to cross Lake Albert from the {{w|Hoima}} district on the Ugandan shore. 

The waterway is known to be dangerous when the weather is rough, and combined with a lack of life-jackets and a general inability of passengers to swim, incidents like this often lead to high body counts. Days before, a campaign had been launched by the DRC to enforce wearing lifejackets aboard all vessels in the nation’s waterways.

Since Saturday, the death toll has continued to climb, it was initially reported that twenty had died. On Monday, UNHCR received information from authorities that 41 people had been rescued and 98 bodies recovered. This number climbed again by Tuesday &ndash; with reports stating 107 had died, including 57 children.

The survivors were taken to the {{w|Bundibugyo}} district, in the north-west of Uganda, where UNHCR and the Ugandan government are providing help, including psycho-social support. Relatives of the deceased are identifying family members at the district hospital.

UNHCR and the Ugandan government are assisting in the transport of the bodies back to the DRC, and have established an information and response point for relatives of the survivors. Julian Paluku, governor of the {{w|North Kivu}} district has said the recovery of bodies will continue.

Reportedly, the refugees had originally fled the DRC after a July 2013 attack on the {{w|Kamango}} region to the east-northeast of the capital, {{w|Kinshasa}}.

Ukrainian troops retake airfield from separatist militants
{{date|April 16, 2014}}
{{Ukraine}}
[[File:Kramatorsk-Ukraine-map.png|thumb|left|Location of Kramatorsk within Ukraine.]]
Yesterday, {{w|Ukraine|Ukrainian}} troops seized an airfield from pro-{{w|Russia}} separatists in the nation's east. The attack comes after warnings from officials in {{w|Moscow}} not to interfere with the minority groups in regard to civil unrest.

The acting Ukrainian President {{w|Oleksandr Turchynov}} spoke prior to the mission, stating that it would be "conducted step by step, responsibly, cautiously". Reports of up to eleven deaths during the seizure have since emerged; Ukrainian officials have denied the claims. 

The airfield resides near the city of {{w|Kramatorsk}}, in the Ukraine region of {{w|Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk}} notable for its population of ethnic Russians. 

[[Geneva]] is to host an international conference held on Thursday; it is feared Russia may leave the meeting. UN Secretary-General {{w|Ban Ki-moon}}'s press office said the secretary-general told Russian President {{w|Vladimir Putin}} he should help "de-escalate" the situation.

First arrests made in Singapore for possession of New Psychoactive Substances
{{date|May 4, 2014}}
{{Singapore}}
The {{w|Central Narcotics Bureau}} (CNB) of [[Singapore]] announced yesterday<!-- on Saturday --> the first arrests made following the listing of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) as Class A controlled drugs on Thursday<!-- May 1 -->, under the First Schedule of the {{w|Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act}}. The suspects, two unnamed male Singaporeans, aged 22 and 23, were reportedly arrested at a shopping center in {{w|Tampines}} on Friday evening for possession of synthetic [[cannabis]], also known as "K2". Authorities recovered 71.7&nbsp;{{w|gram|g}} of the drug from the suspects. 

Under suspicion from the CNB that the 22-year-old suspect was engaged in trafficking of the illegal substance, a further search of his home yielded an additional 22.3 g of synthetic cannabis, raising the total amount of the drug confiscated following the arrests to 94&nbsp;g.

Synthetic cannabis, listed as an NPS, and known as a "legal high", is one of a group of designer drugs created to stimulate the effects of controlled drugs including [[cocaine]], [[Ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]], {{w|methamphetamine}}, and [[heroin]]. The CNB has linked NPS abuse to symptoms including severe intoxication, hallucinations, paranoia, seizures, cadiovascular problems, renal failure, and death.

Typically having chemical structure very similar but slightly different from controlled drugs, these substances have been illegalized, and their possession, consumption, trafficking, and manufacturing now carry penalties comparable to that of controlled drugs. Last year, under the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act, designed to study NPSs before their illegalization, they could be confiscated by authorities, but no further penalty would be levied.

The changes to NPS status follow increases over the past year in NPS trafficking and consumption, according to the CNB. Commenting on the move, a spokesperson for the CNB revealed the organization has reported at least thirty NPS seizures in the period from last May through this February. "Thus far," the spokesperson noted, "synthetic {{w|cannabinoids}} and synthetic {{w|cathinones}} are the two more commonly detected NPS".

Termed an "alarming new drug problem" by the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|Office on Drugs and Crime]], its World Drug Report 2013 indicated an increase to 348 NPSs in 2013, up from 251 in 2012. Capitalizing on their legality &mdash; which no longer holds in Singapore &mdash; NPSs have been known as "legal highs", "research chemicals", "plant food", and "bath salts".

Commenting on the illegalization of NPSs, Ng Ser Song, the director of the CNB, had this to say. “The drug situation is challenging and the number of repeat drug abusers and young drug abusers remains a concern. With the abuse and trafficking of NPS on the rise, listing these new psychoactive substances as Class A controlled drugs signals our unequivocal stance that these substances are illegal and no different from other controlled drugs.” 

Under the recently enacted First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act, if found guilty of drug trafficking, the 22-year-old suspect may be penalized with a minimum of five years in prison and five strokes of the [[caning|cane]]. The act also allows the possession or consumption of New Psychoactive Substances to be punished with a maximum of 10 years imprisonment and/or a {{w|Singapore dollar|$}}20,000 fine.

Mahmoud Abbas asks UN urgently attend to hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners
{{date|June 11, 2014}}
{{Palestine}}

{{W|Saeb Erekat}}, head of the [[Palestine|Palestinian]] Negotiation Group, delivered to the [[UN Security Council]] on Tuesday a letter from the Palestinian president [[Mahmoud Abbas]], urging the [[United Nations|UN]] to tend to the issue of Palestinian administrative detainees in [[Israel]]i prisons who have gone on a hunger strike. He further noted that a new Israeli bill, allowing to force feed hunger strikers, undermines international conventions.
[[File:Mahmoud Abbas 2007.jpg|thumb|left|File photo of Mahmoud Abbas in 2007.  {{image|Matty Stern (U.S. Embassy, Tel Aviv)}}]]
The reportedly longest group hunger strike in Palestinian history is currently taking place. It was initiated in April by 125 Palestinian prisoners detained in Israeli prisons, in a protest against Israel's detention policy, which allows imprisonment without trial or conviction. Since the beginning of the hunger strike, about 80 of them are being treated in hospitals, some facing severe health risks. Some striking prisoners have told [[Egypt]]ian paper ''{{w|Al-Masry Al-Youm}}'' they are determined and will not cease until they win or die a martyr's death. They have also told the paper they had sent letters to the Egyptian leadership, asking it to tend to their situation and put an end to administrative detentions.

With the ongoing hunger strike, an Israeli bill has been drafted, allowing {{w|force-feeding}} of hunger striking prisoners, and use of extra force if needed. {{W|Arab Organization for Human Rights}} prisoners affairs committee manager Janan Abdu said, in communication with ''Al-Masry Al-Youm'', "After the success of individual hunger strikes by {{w|Khader Adnan}}, {{w|Hana Shalabi}}, and Samer al-Issawi and others, Israel is trying to apply a law on forced feeding, which is internationally forbidden and which violates international [[human rights]] and the {{w|Fourth Geneva Convention}}, to break the will of prisoners".

Annual Japanese whaling campaign kills 30 minke whales
{{Japan}}
{{date|June 15, 2014}}
[[File:Uma Baleia Anã nos Açores..jpg|left|thumb|File photo of a minke whale. {{photo credit|Rui Prieto}}]]
[[Japan]]ese officials announced on Friday the country's annual whaling expedition to the north-west [[Pacific Ocean]] has captured and killed 30 {{w|minke whales}}. This comes after the {{w|International Court of Justice}} (ICJ) banned Japan from continuing its [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] scientific whale hunting programmes in March this year.

The [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]] governments had brought the Antarctic whaling issue to the attention of the ICJ earlier this year. The [[JARPA II]] whaling programme had been officially classified as scientific research, however when the programme had been investigated at the ICJ, the court decided there wasn't enough science involved to justify it. They ordered Japan to stop whaling in the Antarctic, but this ruling only mentioned JARPA II &mdash; not the annual Pacific whaling hunts.

This has allowed whaling to continue in the north-west Pacific Ocean. Even after the court had ordered the termination of JARPA II, sixty per cent of Japanese citizens still believed scientific whaling should go on, as measured in a poll conducted by the {{w|Asahi Shimbun}} newspaper in April 2014.

This sentiment was echoed by Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]], who recently stated he intended "the resumption of commercial whaling by conducting whaling research in order to obtain scientific data indispensable for the management of whale resources."

The [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] says up to 200 minke whales can be hunted during the North Pacific expedition. Japan has maintained scientific whaling programmes intend to understand the global whale populations, with the research programmes aiming to prove the global whale population is sustainable, allowing commercial whale hunting to resume.

Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries had also planned to petition the [[International Whaling Commission]] next year with a new Antarctic whaling proposal.

Candidates walk out of Afghan election audit
{{date|August 28, 2014}}
{{Afghanistan}}
[[Afghanistan]]'s two presidential candidates, [[Ashraf Ghani]] and [[Abdullah Abdullah]], withdrew their observers from the ongoing audit of votes yesterday, following the June presidential election.
[[File:Abdullah Abdullah 2014.jpg|left|thumb|Abdullah Abdullah {{image|[https://www.flickr.com/people/9364837@N06 US Department of State]}}]]
Abdullah's observers declined to participate, claiming fraudulent ballots were not being thrown out and questioning the legitimacy of the process. Ghani's observers were later asked to withdraw by the [[United Nations]] monitors overseeing the process. They agreed, describing the decision as prudent.

The audit was continued in the afternoon.

The process of checking each of the eight million votes is part of a deal brokered by the {{w|US}}. The recount started a month ago.  A spokesman for President {{w|Hamid Karzai}} has said the delay is affecting the country's security, as the [[Afghan Taliban|Taliban]] continue to launch attacks across the country. Analysts suggest it is also affecting the Afghan economy.

Both candidates have previously agreed to form a unity government involving the other. Abdullah's side, trailing before the recount, is looking for more powers and responsibilities for the losing side, while their opposition apparently don't want to weaken presidential power. Both candidates also agree US forces should stay in the country after 2014.

Gaza Strip suffers harsh economic collapse: UN
{{date|September 5, 2014}}
{{Palestine}}

The {{W|United Nations Conference on Trade and Development}} (UNCTAD) reported harsh economic collapse in the [[Gaza Strip]] on Wednesday, calling for its reconstruction. In a statement to the press, the organizations said that the data included in the report doesn't take into consideration the outcomes of the recent conflict with [[Israel]].

According to the Conference's annual report, the economic growth in Gaza has dwindled from 11% between 2010-2012 to only 1.5%  in the past year, and the cost of rebuilding it is estimated at about 1.8 billion dollars. The UNCTAD warns of disastrous outcomes if the situation isn't addressed immediately.

Beyond foreign support, the organization recommends taking steps that would allow the Gazan economy to stabilize and eventually stand on its own and decrease its dependence on foreign economies.
 
"The situation in reality is graver than what is mentioned in the report, as it was prepared before the latest Israeli offensive operation on Gaza strip," said Economic Affairs officer in the Assistance to the Palestinian People Unit in UNCTAD Mutasim Elagraa.

Furthermore, UNCTAD's coordinator for the {{w|Palestinian Territories}}, Mahmoud Elkhafif, told reporters that now, following the damages caused by the conflict, rebuilding Gaza would require more than 4 billion dollars.

Five hundred migrants alleged killed in deliberate sinking in Mediterranean
{{date|September 17, 2014}}
{{Palestine}}

The {{W|International Organization for Migration}} (IOM) said on Monday about 500 migrants may have been killed in a deliberate sinking in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] last week. The unverified claim comes after IOM debriefed two [[Palestine|Palestinian]] survivors.

In a statement, IOM said, "If this story, which police are investigating, is true, it would be the worst shipwreck in years". The organization added, if the story would be revealed as true it would be "not an accident but a mass murder, perpetrated by criminals without scruples or any respect for human life". 

IOM Spokesperson in {{W|Italy}} Flavio Di Giacomo told {{W|Agence France-Presse|AFP}}, "Two survivors brought to [[Sicily]] told us that there had been at least 500 people on board. Nine other survivors were rescued by {{W|Greece|Greek}} and {{w|Malta|Maltese}} ships, but all the rest appear to have perished".

According to the two survivors, the boat, which departed on September 6 from {{W|Damietta}}, [[Egypt]] bound for Malta, sank in the Mediterranean Sea last Wednesday when {{W|people smugglers}} rammed it; drowning the vast majority of its 500 plus passengers, including refugees from Egypt, [[Sudan]], [[Syria]] and Palestine. They said the smugglers had become angry when the passengers refused transfer to a smaller vessel that they doubted could carry them. 

The Palestinian ambassador to Malta, Jubran Tawil, said three Palestinians who had been on board the boat have been rescued with aid from Panamanian ships and flown to Malta by a Maltese helicopter together with some of the dead.

According to [[UN]] data, this year the number of migrants by sea to Europe exceeds 130,000, up by 50,000 from last year. Many people from North Africa and the Middle East attempt to reach Europe on overcrowded, unsafe boats. Over 2,500 people on this journey have drowned or disappeared this year, 2,200 of them since June.

Nation mourns, world condemns Taliban attack on Pakistan army school
{{date|December 18, 2014}}
{{Pakistan}}
In the wake of Tuesday's high-school attack by the {{w|Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Pakistani Taliban}} (TTK) on an {{w|Army Public School Peshawar|army public school}}, Prime Minister {{w|Nawaz Sharif}} announced a three-day period of official mourning<!-- BBC report, 17th-->. In addition to condemnation from world leaders &mdash; who include {{w|United Nations|UN}} Secretary-General {{w|Ban Ki-moon}}, the {{w|President of the European Parliament}} {{w|Martin Schulz}},<!-- Both noted in Euronews report, 16th, 'worldwide condemnation'  --> and Deputy director David Griffiths of {{w|Amnesty International}}<!--Newsweek Pakistan source--> &mdash; news agency ''Reuters'' are reporting the {{w|Afghanistan|Afghan}} {{w|Taliban}} have also issued a statement condemning the attack.<!--Searched 2nd source, all echo-chambering the Reuters report; is mentioned in-passing by BBC report of 17th-->

The statement carried by ''{{w|Reuters}}'', claiming to be from Taliban spokesman {{w|Zabihullah Mujahid}}, reads: "The intentional killing of innocent people, children and women are against the basics of Islam and this criteria has to be considered by every Islamic party and government."<!-- Toronto Sun source again --> Tuesday's attack on the Army Public School in {{w|Pakistan}}'s north-western city of {{w|Peshawar}} claimed the lives of 132 children, and nine staff from the school<!--Euronews 'deadliest attack' source, crosscheck via Independent-->.

Official reports, following police and military action against the attackers, insist seven people took part in the school attack; although a statement, issued by the TTK, insists there were only six<!--BBC, 17th again-->, their targets being older pupils. The attack began in the mid morning local time<!-- 10am local, 0500 UTC by BBC timeline 'as it happened'; Quartz source puts this +1hr, looking for crosscheck-->, with the assailants observed entering the compound wearing {{w|suicide vest|suicide vests}}. Shortly thereafter, shots were heard with survivors reporting the gunmen were shooting people indiscriminately, going from classroom to classroom, killing teachers and students as they found them.

The massacre sparked a public outcry, both national and international; which, press speculate, led to the TTK stressing the intent to only target older students at the army school.<!-- statement is covered in quartz source, IIRC BBC carry some of the speculation-->

{{w|Turkey}} announced one day of national mourning<!-- reviewer found Turkey mentioned in Newsweek, Euronews 'Worldwide condemnation' -->. Described as impossible to justify and "blood-curdling" by the UN Secretary-General, EU Parliamentary President Schulz labelled the attack "abominable and cowardly [demonstrating] the inhuman attitude of the Taliban, their inhuman ideology, their remorseless fanaticism", and {{w|India|Indian}} Nobel Prize-winner {{w|Kailash Satyarthi}}, condemned the attackers as "enemies of Allah" and stated:  "The militants, be they Taliban or any other militants, who kill children, are the enemies of humanity. This attack is a blot on humanity".<!-- to verify statement-->

In addition to a three-day period of national mourning, President Sharif reintroduced Pakistan's {{w|death penalty}}.<!-- BBC source of 17th-->

UN Security Council heads to Haiti amid political instability
{{date|January 24, 2015}}
{{Haiti}}
Representatives of the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]'s (UNSC) fifteen member states flew to [[Haiti]] yesterday<!-- on Friday -->. The nation is moving to hold new elections with President [[Michel Martelly]] presently ruling by decree.
[[File:Michel Joseph Martelly - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012.jpg|thumb|left|250px|President Martelly, seen here in 2012, is ruling by decree after the collapse of parliament.{{image|[[World Economic Forum]]}}]]
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday<!-- on Friday -->. It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years. Last month a presidential commission recommended the prior CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections. The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that started in October. The sometimes-violent protests were triggered by failure to hold elections, some due since 2011.

On January 12 the {{w|Haitian Senate|Senate}} was reduced to a defunct ten members, with sixteen <!--new source says 15  but multiple on old article said 16; confusion with the 15 UNSC members, perhaps?--> required for a [[wikt:quorum|quorum]]. Amendments to electoral law were required by the Senate before elections due in 2011 could be held. Rival political factions were unable to resolve disagreements. The lower level of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, also saw all 99 seats vacated.

Also due are municipal elections, with 4,000 local posts needing refilled. A presidential election is due this year and the constitution forbids a consecutive term for Martelly. CEP members were sworn in yesterday<!-- on Friday --> at the {{w|Supreme Court of Haiti|Supreme Court}}; the presidential commission also recommended a new head for the court.

This month Martelly installed a new cabinet including opposition members, amongst them appointing {{w|Evans Paul}} as Prime Minister. Paul replaces {{w|Laurent Lamothe}} who resigned last month at the request of Martelly's commission. Paul was yesterday<!-- on Friday --> joined by foreign diplomats to welcome the new CEP in {{w|Petionville}}, the CEP headquarters.

Protests continued around the nation yesterday<!-- on Friday -->, with anger directed at foreign leaders who have supported Martelly as well as the local regime. [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Spain]], the [[United States]], the [[European Union]], and the {{w|Organization of American States}} expressed in a joint statement "support to the president of the republic in the exercise of his constitutional duty to ensure the regular functioning of institutions and the continuity of the state" as parliament's terms lapsed and power passed to Martelly alone. 

The UN is unpopular in Haiti where many blame their peacekeeping force for a 2010 {{w|cholera}} outbreak, which is ongoing with 9,000 deaths. The UN has extended the peacekeeping mission for another year but does plan to reduce troops from around 5,000 to around 2,400. Anti-peacekeeper protests have also focussed on sexual abuse allegations.

Suicide bombers attack mosques in Sanaa, Yemen
{{date|March 21, 2015}}
{{Yemen}}

Two mosques in [[Sana'a|Sanaa]], [[Yemen]]'s capital, were attacked by suicide bombers yesterday<!-- on Friday -->, killing over 100 and injuring over 250 more. 

The attacks targeted mosques used by supporters of the {{w|Houthi}} rebel movement, who reportedly support former president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] and now control Sanaa. The elected president, {{w|Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi}}, has moved to [[Aden]], to the south.

[[Islam|Muslim]] militant group [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] have claimed responsibility for the attack, according to [[Twitter]] accounts known to be connected to the group. Islamic State are known to have set up a base in Yemen last November, but are not known to have previously carried out an attack there. A {{w|White House}} spokesman, Josh Earnest, stated that the group's claim of responsibility cannot be confirmed, and raised the possibility the claim could be propaganda.

{{w|al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula}}, centered in Yemen, denied responsibility, highlighting their leader has declared mosques and markets off-limits for attack. Yemeni Political adviser Mohamed Qubaty attributed the attacks to supporters of Saleh. Qubaty called the attacks "a plot to widen the schism between the [[Sunni]]s and {{w|Zaydi|Zaydis}}". ''Zaydi'' refers to the branch of Islam followed by the Houthis.

[[UN]] {{w|UN Secretary General|Secretary General}} [[Ban Ki-moon]] condemned the attacks and called for hostilities to cease, urging restraint.

UN publishes report on 2014 Gaza conflict
{{date|April 29, 2015}}
{{Palestine}}

On Monday the [[United Nations|UN]] published a summary of its report regarding the inquiry into incidents that had taken place last summer during the conflict between [[Israel]] and [[Hamas]] in the [[Gaza Strip]].

UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] announced in November 2014 an inquiry would be made into ten incidents that took place in schools operated by {{w|UNRWA}}, the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees. Aside from investigating Israeli strikes on seven of these institutions, the report also examines three cases in which Hamas-owned weaponry was hidden in such schools. Other than the summary, the full 207-page inquiry report is not to be made public.

The inquiry was based on analysis of weaponry, medical reports, videos and still footage. In addition, the investigators relied on testimonies of UN employees and workers from other organizations in the Gaza strip. The investigation, led by former {{w|Netherlands|Dutch}} General {{w|Patrick Cammaert}}, is separate from the investigation led by the UN's {{w|United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council}}. Ban added on Monday that he assigned senior managers to consider the recommendations made by the investigators.

Along with the publication of the report, Ban Ki Moon stated in a letter that the harm done to UN institutions that gave shelter to civilians is a "matter of the utmost gravity". According to UNWRA, the full report indicates that information regarding the humanitarian use of these schools had been transmitted continually to Israel during the conflict.

Mr. Ban also wrote “I am dismayed that Palestinian militant groups would put United Nations schools at risk by using them to hide their arms.”

UNRWA told {{w|the Guardian}} that although it sent the Israeli military the schools' {{w|Global Positioning System|GPS}} coordinates, in seven incidents examined by the investigation team the attacks were attributed to Israel. Furthermore, UNRWA has affirmed, as is coinciding with the investigation's conclusions, that the organization did not transfer arms to Hamas and had developed a mechanism to handle the existence of arms in its facilities with the help of international experts.

The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded regarding the issue, saying that "Israel makes every effort to avoid harm to sensitive sites" and that "All of the incidents attributed by the report to Israel have already been subject to thorough examinations, and criminal investigations have been launched where relevant."

Hamas and the [[Palestinian Authority]] did not immediately respond.

Tony Blair resigns as envoy of Quartet to Middle East
{{date|May 29, 2015}}
{{palestine}}

Former [[UK|British]] Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] announced on Wednesday his intention to resign from his post as the {{w|Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet}}'s envoy to the [[Middle East]], to [[UN]] Secretary General {{W|Ban Ki Moon}}. Blair has held this position for the past eight years, and his resignation is to take effect in June. 

The Quartet on the Middle East, formed in 2002, is made up of {{w|Russia}}, the {{w|United States}}, the UN, and the {{w|EU}}. Its purpose is to promote the [[Israel]]i&ndash;[[Palestine|Palestinian]] peace process and to help develop the Palestinian economy.

''{{w|The Independent}}'' suggests deterioration of Blair's relationship with leading figures in the {{W|Palestinian National Authority}}. Reportedly Blair means to continue with his diplomatic efforts after his resignation; to "concentrate on strengthening relations between Israel and the wider Arab world", as well as "focus on encouraging Israel to take measures to dramatically improve the daily lives of Palestinians in {{W|Gaza Strip|Gaza}}."

Preceding Wednesday's meeting on the peace process by the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee in {{W|Brussels}}, Blair's office wrote in its last report to the committee: "Over a year on from the breakdown in talks between Israel and the Palestinians, there is still no tangible political horizon in sight."

Following Blair's resignation, the Quartet issued a formal statement saying "As the Quartet's envoy on the ground during the last eight years, Mr Blair demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the cause of Israeli&ndash;Palestinian peace and made lasting contributions to the effort to promote economic growth and improve daily life in the West Bank and Gaza".

South Sudanese President Salva Kiir signs peace deal
{{date|August 27, 2015}}
{{South Sudan}}
[[File:Salva Kiir Mayardit at the White House (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Salva Kiir in the [[United States]] last year.{{image credit|U.S. Department of State}}]]
{{w|Salva Kiir}}, the President of [[South Sudan]], yesterday signed a deal designed to end a civil ethnic conflict that has killed thousands and displaced over two million.

Under the deal Kiir will share power with {{w|Riek Machar}}. Machar was Vice President but Kiir sacked him in 2013. December that year saw the dispute turn to war. Kiir is a {{w|Dinka}} while Machar is a {{w|Nuer people|Nuer}}, and the conflict has largely split along these racial lines.

Kiir spoke of "serious reservations" at the signing ceremony in [[Juba]]. He is concerned about a requirement to consult "First Vice President" Machar, as he will be under the deal, on policies. He is also concerned about demilitarisation of Juba.

The deal to close the 20-month conflict was negotiated in [[Ethiopia]], where Machar signed the same deal last week. Several ceasefires have failed over months of talks. Kiir, the only leader in South Sudan since independence in 2011, sought an extension of a two-week deadline but signed yesterday after [[United Nations]] sanctions were threatened.

Both sides accused the other of continuing hostilities. The rebels claimed government forces attacked them south of Juba, but say they were victorious. Kiir claimed the rebels attacked a northern position. Kiir says international leaders were "careless" with negotiations and warned a flawed deal could do more harm.

[[Uganda]]n President {{w|Yoweri Museveni}}, [[Ethiopia]]n Prime Minister {{w|Hailemariam Desalegn}}, [[Kenya]]n President {{w|Uhuru Kenyatta}}, and UN secretary-general [[Ban Ki-moon]] all expressed their approval of the deal's signing. Kenyatta called it a "happy day for us in the region". Earlier in the day he warned there was "no such thing as a perfect agreement" and Museveni said the conflict was "the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time".

Vatican to Palestinians: Remove us from your Draft Resolution to UN General Assembly
{{date|August 28, 2015}}
{{Palestine}}

On Tuesday the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] asked the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PA) to remove references to the Vatican in a PA proposal that observer states' flags be raised at the [[United Nations]] alongside full members. Both [[Palestine]] and the Vatican are non-member observers.
[[File:Flags at the United Nations headquarters 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Some of the flags, including Israel's, at the UN's [[New York]] headquarters.{{image credit|[[Commons:User:Damzow|Damzow]]}}]]
The draft Palestinian resolution, intended for presentation to the [[UN General Assembly]], refers to the Vatican but reports suggest no approval was sought beforehand. The Vatican stated it would not object to the Palestinian proposal, but asks not to be included in it.

A message from the Vatican delegation to several members of the UN, quoted by {{w|Reuters}}, says "The Holy See does not intend to co-sponsor a draft resolution that the State of Palestine may eventually present on the matter". The note further reads that "The Holy See asks the Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations kindly to remove in its draft resolution any reference to the 'Holy See' and any generic reference 'on behalf of the Observer States'".

Press reports suggest the PA included the Vatican in its draft resolution in order to prevent objections by [[Israel]] and the {{W|United States|US}}. {{W|Pope Francis}}'s first visit to the US begins next month. During his tour he intends to speak before the UN General Assembly in [[New York]], attended by high ranking envoys from 193 states. During the Assembly, world leaders are expected to launch an initiative to end world hunger and poverty within the next 15 years.

In May, the Vatican acknowledged the Palestinian state, in a move the Israeli foreign ministry described as "disappointing." According to the PA, the Vatican is one of 136 states who recognize Palestine as a state. Israel and the US do not.

Study estimates Earth has over three trillion trees
{{date|September 3, 2015}}
{{Biology}}
A study published yesterday<!--See the external link, string search September, everything else is from the news sources--> by ''{{w|Nature (journal)|Nature}}'' estimates the global tree population at just over three trillion. Previous work estimated the total at 400 billion.
[[File:Young tree (12517050495).jpg|thumb|left|249px|A young tree in [[Saudi Arabia]]{{Image credit|[http://www.flickr.com/people/10345599@N03 Francisco Anzola]}}]]
The international research, led by [[Yale University]] in the [[US]], used satellite images to examine over 400,000 plots of land for estimated tree density. Subarctic regions of {{w|Scandinavia}}, [[Russia]], and [[North America]] had the highest densities but the largest forested areas were tropical. The study puts 43% of trees in the tropics, where deforestation is particularly common.

The study also claims the number has been cut by human activity from around six trillion 12,000 years ago. Lead researcher Thomas Crowther said "We have nearly halved the number of trees on the planet, and we have seen the impacts on climate and human health as a result. This study highlights how much more effort is needed if we are to restore healthy forests worldwide." Crowther was "surprised" to come up with a number as high as the trillions.

The study was made at the request of a [[United Nations]] project which wanted an estimate on which to base reforestation targets. As well as numbers and distribution the study looks at what factors might control the density of trees in any given area, such as soil type. The study suggests trees outnumber humans by around 422 to one.

"It's not like we've discovered a load of new trees; it's not like we've discovered a load of new carbon", cautioned Crowther, speaking to the [[BBC]]. "So, it's not good news for the world or bad news that we've produced this new number." He says the estimate is valuable for lawmakers, academics, and the general public.

Texas student Ahmed Mohamed inspires social movement
{{date|September 22, 2015}}

{{Texas}}News of police response to a boy's digital clock in Texas last week has inspired a global {{w|social movement}} in support of the youth. {{w|Ahmed Mohamed clock incident|Ahmed Mohamed}}, a 14-year-old boy from {{w|Irving, Texas|Irving}}, [[Texas]], was arrested at his school by police after he brought a digital clock he had made to school. After news of the police response was reported, Mohamed received support online ranging from US President [[Barack Obama]] to [[Facebook]] creator [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. Yesterday<!-- On Monday --> Mohamed received {{wikt|VIP}} attention at [[Google]] headquarters in [[California]] at the Google Science Fair &mdash; and tommorow<!-- on Wednesday --> he plans to meet international dignitaries at the [[United Nations]] headquarters in [[New York]].

[[File:President Obama tweet to student Ahmed Mohamed.jpg|thumb|left|450px|US President [[Barack Obama]] tweet to student {{w|Ahmed Mohamed clock incident|Ahmed Mohamed}}{{Image credit|[[Twitter]]/Barack Obama}}]]
Mohamed brought the digital clock he made to school on September 14, and a teacher mistakenly thought it resembled a bomb. Police arrested and questioned the student. Images of the boy wearing a {{w|NASA}} T-shirt and handcuffed by the police were quickly posted and reposted online.
{{QuoteRight|Hoping that the #istandwithahmed movement translates into a substantive national conversation on race, punishment, and incarceration.|4={{w|Marc Lamont Hill}}}}
The ''{{w|Deseret News}}'' observed that the hashtag on [[Twitter]], #IStandWithAhmed, had become an international phenomenon. ''{{w|The Straits Times}}'' noted what began as individual messages to Mohamed had grown into a "support movement". American academic and professor {{w|Marc Lamont Hill}} commented, "Hoping that the #istandwithahmed movement translates into a substantive national conversation on race, punishment, and incarceration."

The Twitter attention led to outreach from [[Google]] and Mohamed was invited to their Google Science Fair. Mohamed was a VIP guest at the Google Science Fair this weekend, and was able to meet finalists at the event held at Google's headquarters located in {{w|Mountain View, California|Mountain View}}, {{w|California}}. Co-founder of Google, {{w|Sergey Brin}}, personally met with Mohamed during his visit to Google.

On Wednesday, Mohamed and his father are to travel to the {{w|United Nations}}. His father {{w|Mohamed El-Hassan Mohamed}} said he was taking his entire family to the U.N. headquarters in [[New York]], because international dignitaries wanted to meet with his son and express their support.

Psychology major at {{w|University of Texas Arlington}} Amneh Jafari heard of the incident and wanted to issue her support to Mohamed. She chose the hastag #IStandWithAhmed and posted to [[Twitter]]. Jafari said she felt Mohamed had been subject to {{w|Islamophobia}} and her hashtag created greater awareness about this issue. The hashtag took on a life of its own, and was used in messages on Twitter over one million times by Thursday night.

[[File:NASA tweet to student Ahmed Mohamed.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]] tweeted support of Ahmed Mohamed via its account {{w|International Space Station}}{{image credit|Twitter/NASA}}]]
US President [[Barack Obama]] tweeted using his @POTUS account: "Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great."

[[Twitter]] gave Mohamed the option to come to their company for an internship. [[Facebook]] co-founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] tweeted to Mohamed and said the boy was welcome to come and tour the company.

Executive director of the Dallas chapter of the {{w|Council on American-Islamic Relations}} Alia Salem said Mohamed wishes to use his newfound fame and attention to spotlight social causes including the treatment of Muslims in the United States.

{{w|University of Texas Arlington}} Muslim Student Association president Sehar Memon said the large amount of positive feedback for Mohamed had helped make his situation much better. Memon also said she believed the social movement in reaction to Mohamed helped improve Muslim/non-Muslim.

Both the Irving Independent School District and the Irving Police Department have asserted that the boy's religion and name were not a factor in the manner in which they approached the situation.

Twenty two civilians,<!--para 1, Reuters--> including three children,<!--para 2, BBC--> died, [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF) reported, on Saturday after a [[United States]] airstrike hit a hospital in the city of {{w|Kunduz}} in northern [[Afghanistan]]. Amongst the fatalities were twelve charity staff working for MSF. MSF said there were about two hundred people in the building.

The Afghan interior ministry claimed there had been a [[Afghan Taliban|Taliban]] presence in the hospital although this was denied by the insurgent organization.

The attack was also condemned by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], whilst the UN {{w|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|High Commissioner for Human Rights}}, {{w|Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein}}, described the strike as "inexcusable" and called for a full investigation.

China anti-textbook protests grow larger
{{date|April 10, 2005}}
[[File:Flag of China.png|thumb|right|The protesters repeated their demands for a boycott of Japanese goods, to block [[Japan]] from obtaining a seat on the [[U.N. Security Council]], and for Japan to change textbooks which they say whitewash Japan's war atrocities.]]
[[China|Chinese]] protests against the publication of a Japanese government textbook continued for a second day in China, (Sunday) as an estimated three thousand protesters marched on the Japanese consulate in [[Guangzhou]]. Thousands of protesters also marched in [[Shenzhen]], throwing objects at Japanese businesses.

The protesters repeated their demands for a boycott of Japanese goods, to block Japan from obtaining a seat on the [[U.N. Security Council]], and for Japan to change textbooks which they say whitewash Japan's war atrocities. Protesters burned Japanese flags while singing and shouting anti-Japanese slogans. They also carried anti-Japanese signs along with Chinese flags.
Chinese view the textbook as "whitewashing" the events and actions of Japan to cast them in a more positive light. 

The protests are against the {{w|Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform}}, which is publishing a high-school textbook that refers to the Nanjing Massacre as an "incident" ([http://www.wellesley.edu/Polisci/wj/China/Nanjing/nanjing3.html translation]) and de-emphasizes the roles of comfort women as well as the contemporary issues surrounding Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni shrine, in honor of Japanese soldiers. 

The Japanese government has claimed that the demonstrations have an "anti-Japanese sentiment," for which China should apologise.
In {{w|Tokyo}}, Japan formally summoned Wang Yi, China's ambassador to Japan, concerning China's actions on Sunday.

"We formally demanded China’s apology and compensation," said Japanese Foreign Minister {{w|Nobutaka Machimura}}. He also said that Wang Yi replied "No" when asked for an apology.

While not issuing a formal apology through diplomatic channels, Wang claimed that China did not approve of the violent aspects of the protests.

"The (Chinese) government does not agree with extreme action," he said.

Back in {{w|Beijing}}, the ''People's Daily'' reported that Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang deflected blame away from China for the recent downturn in Sino-Japanese relations.

"Japan must adopt an earnest attitude and appropriate ways to deal with major principled issues concerning the feelings of the Chinese people," Qin said. "The Japanese have to do more things conducive to enhancing mutual trust and maintaining the relations between the two countries, rather than doing the reverse," he said.

Time magazine names Ahmed Mohamed to 'Most Influential Teens of 2015'
{{date|October 28, 2015}}

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named 14-year-old {{w|Ahmed Mohamed clock incident|Ahmed Mohamed}} yesterday<!-- on Tuesday --> to its list of "30 Most Influential Teens of 2015". He was made famous after being taken into custody by police when a teacher thought a clock he brought to his [[Texas]] school looked like a bomb. Mohamed joins the ranks of influential teens including [[US]] President [[Barack Obama]]'s daughter {{w|Malia Obama|foreign=suppress}}, and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Malala Yousafzai]].

''Time'' said of Mohamed in announcing the news: "Not many people make national news by bringing a homemade clock to school. But the ninth-grader's arrest, after teachers and authorities mistook said clock for a bomb, kicked off a national debate over racial profiling".

Mohamed traveled to the [[White House]] last week where he met with US President [[Barack Obama]]. His family said last week that they would move from Texas to [[Qatar]], where Mohamed was offered a full-scholarship to a well-respected school in the country.

The September 14 incident in {{w|Irving, Texas|Irving}}, Texas triggered a wider discussion about {{w|Islamophobia}} within the community. The [[Twitter]] hashtag #IStandWithAhmed became part of a {{w|social movement}} in support of the youth. After news of the police response was reported, Mohamed received support online ranging from US President [[Barack Obama]] to [[Facebook]] creator [[Mark Zuckerberg]].

Mohamed brought the digital clock he made to school on September 14, and a teacher mistakenly thought it resembled a bomb. Police arrested and questioned the student. Images of the boy wearing a [[NASA]] T-shirt and handcuffed by the police were quickly posted and reposted online.

Co-founder of Google, {{w|Sergey Brin}}, personally met with Mohamed during his visit to Google.

US President [[Barack Obama]] tweeted using his @POTUS account: "Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great." [[Twitter]] gave Mohamed the option to come to their company for an internship. [[Facebook]] co-founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] tweeted to Mohamed and said the boy was welcome to come and tour the company.

Both the Irving Independent School District and the Irving Police Department have asserted that the boy's religion and name were not a factor in the manner in which they approached the situation.

European court upholds asset freeze in terrorist case
{{date|October 4, 2005}}

On September 21st, the Court of First Instance of the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled that decisions of the United Nations Security Council take precedence over national constitutions, European law and even the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR). Observers claim that this ruling undermines the rule of law and the principles of the constitutional state.

In their verdict in the case of Ahmed Ali Yusuf, a Swede of Arab origin whose funds had been frozen in November 2001 by the European authorities after a Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council had put him on a list of alleged terrorists, the five judges state that:
''
“the right of access to the courts, a principle recognised by both Article 8 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 16 December 1966, is not absolute.”''

The Court holds that even organisations (like the European Union) that are not members of the United Nations are bound by decisions of the UN Security Council.

The lawyer of the convicted:

''"[The verdict] is completely unacceptable [and] raises questions about the EU’s position as regards the rule of law.”"'' 

Ahmed Ali Yusuf says he will appeal to the European Court of Justice.

States pledge $10 billion for aid to Syria
{{Politics and conflicts}}
{{date|February 5, 2016}}
Yesterday<!-- On Thursday -->, a donor conference of nations was held in {{w|Westminster}}, {{w|London}}, {{w|United Kingdom}} to collect money for aid to {{w|Syria}}. UK Prime Minister {{w|David Cameron}} announced more than {{w|United States dollar|$}}10 billion were pledged in one day, for "food, medical care, and shelter", and other purposes including creation of schools to benefit one million Syrian children by the end of the coming school year. Cameron also said this was the biggest sum ever collected for an international crisis in one day.

[[File:Cameron David.jpg|200px|thumb|left|David Cameron, British PM, in 2014.]]
The "Supporting Syria and the Region" conference goal was more than $7 billion asked for by the {{w|United Nations}} and around $1.3 billion by countries of the region. Pledges included $3.3 billion from the {{w|European Union}}; $1.7 billion from the UK until 2020; $2.6 billion from {{w|Germany}} until 2018; and for 2016, $1 billion from {{w|France}} and $935 million from the {{w|United States}}.

{{w|Ahmet Davutoğlu}}, {{w|Turkey|Turkish}} prime minister, said a Syrian government offensive with Russian air support is sending about another 70,000 Syrians to the Turkish border, and expressed worry this would continue.  Syrian rebels suspended {{w|Geneva}}, {{w|Switzerland}} peace talks with the regime of {{w|Bashar al-Assad}}, protesting the current offensive. The {{w|Syrian Observatory for Human Rights}} recently said {{w|Russia|Russian}} airstrikes have killed around 1,400 Syrian civilians.

North Korea launches long-range missile
{{North Korea}}
{{date|February 8, 2016}}

The [[South Korea]]n defense ministry said [[North Korea]] launched a long-range missile yesterday<!-- on Sunday -->.

North Korea had announced a plan to the {{w|International Maritime Organization}} (IMO) for a terrestrial observation satellite launch between February 8 and 25.  North Korean state media reported the satellite launch was successful and was ordered by North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]] with more plans to launch satellites.

The launch occurred at 09:31am local time (0031 {{w|UTC}}) and was detected by a South Korean warship, according to ministry spokesman Moon Sang Gyun. Nations including [[Japan]] and South Korea considered the launch a disguised ballistic missile test. Japan, South Korea, and the [[United States]] condemned the launch and called for an emergency meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council]] to be held in [[New York City|New York]] yesterday at 11:00am local time (1600 UTC).

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe called the launch "unacceptable" and said, "We will take action to totally protect the safety and well-being of our people". South Korean President Park Geun-hye also called the launch "unacceptable" and a "challenge to world peace". Japanese public broadcaster {{w|NHK}} said the rocket passed in Japanese airspace over {{w|Okinawa}} without provoking use of anti-ballistic missiles.

North Korea claimed in January to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb.

UN tribunal dismisses Chinese claims to South China Sea
{{date|July 14, 2016}}
{{Politics and conflicts}}

[[File:Relief Map of South China Sea.png|thumb|left|Map of South China Sea. {{image|Nzeemin, NordNordWest}}]]
On Tuesday, a {{W|United Nations}} (UN) tribunal in {{W|The Hague}} dismissed {{W|China}}'s sovereignty claims to the {{W|South China Sea}}, a body of water connecting to the {{W|Pacific Ocean}} which is also bordered by the {{W|Philippines}}, {{W|Vietnam}}, {{W|Brunei}}, {{W|Malaysia}}, {{W|Taiwan}}, and {{W|Indonesia}}. Court battles over the claims between China and the Philippines go back to 2013.

These claims were established by China during the reign of its {{W|Nationalist government}} in the 1940s, marked by a demarcation line nicknamed its ''{{W|Nine-dash line}}''. Its line stretched hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland, including about nine tenths of the entire sea. The South China Sea is a valuable property, providing passage for about {{W|US dollar|US$}}5&nbsp;trillion in trade by planes and boats every year. China is not the only country to claim large parts of the sea; notably, Taiwan and Vietnam have also done so, but other large-scale claimants have been less militarily active about their claims than China.

China has built several artificial islands and military bases in the South China Sea. The tribunal scolded the impeding of fishing and exploration in the sea by China, which it deemed against the {{W|United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea}} (UNCLOS), signed by China in 1982. The tribunal also concluded China knowingly permitted the poaching of endangered {{W|Turtle|turtles}} and {{W|Clam|clams}} as well as destroyed {{w|coral reef|coral reefs}} to construct artificial islands.

UNCLOS permits countries to claim a 200-{{w|nautical mile}} area from their mainland, referred to as an exclusive economic zone. It also permits {{W|freedom of navigation}}, allowing unimpeded exploration through "high seas": international waters also available for the use of fishing and trade passages.

There is no process to enforce the decision. UNCLOS allows countries to exclude themselves from "compulsory binding procedures for the settlement of disputes" as defined in Part XV, Section 3 - Article 298. China exercised this right to exclude themselves from compulsory binding procedures on August 25, 2006.  They reject the jurisdiction or authority of the tribunal's findings.  Various other countries have also exercised Article 298 partially or fully, such as {{w|Australia}}, {{w|Canada}}, the {{w|UK}}, {{w|Russia}}, and {{w|France}}.

Many nations made statements after the decision. The Chinese government opposed the decision, calling it "ill-founded". It said "China neither accepts nor recognizes" the decision. The Philippine government referred to the decision as a "milestone decision". The {{W|United States of America|US}}, a key ally with many of the countries claiming parts of the sea, said it was an "important contribution to the shared goal of a peaceful resolution to disputes in the South China Sea".

Nigerian jet attacks refugee camp, killing dozens
{{date|January 18, 2017}}
{{politics and conflicts}}
A [[Nigeria|Nigerian]] {{w|Nigerian Air Force|Air Force}} jet fighter mistook refugees for rebels yesterday, Nigerian military said, firing on a camp in Rann, {{w|Borno State}}. Dozens of refugees and aid workers died.
[[File:RéfugiésMaiduguri2016B.jpg|thumb|left|300px|File photo of a refugee camp in {{w|Maiduguri}}, Nigeria.{{image credit|[[Voice of America]]}}]]
The lowest estimate from [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF) is of 50 dead. The [[BBC]] estimates at least 52 dead, while one Borno State official is attributed by [[Associated Press|AP]] as saying over 100 are dead. MSF say at least 200 were wounded.

The [[Red Cross]] said at least six of its staff died and twelve more injured. The impoverished region, in the northeast of the nation, has suffered severe famine as conflict interrupts agriculture. Farmers are unable to work owing to bombs on their land. The Red Cross said volunteers were at the camp, home to thousands, to distribute food.

The military said the Air Force was dispatched to deal with "remnants" of the [[Boko Haram]] militant group, which it claims to be in a final push against. Major General Leo Irabor, who led the operation, said, "Unfortunately, the strike was conducted but it turned out that other civilians were somewhere around the area and they were affected". Irabor said two soldiers were amongst the dead and others were wounded.

Military spokesman General Rabe Abubakar said the military are "all in pain" after the disaster, adding "in a military operation such as this, from time to time these things do occur." Irabor promised an investigation. President [[Muhammadu Buhari]] said he was saddened by "this regrettable operational mistake" and sought calm.

"This large-scale attack on vulnerable people who have already fled from extreme violence is shocking and unacceptable," MSF operational chief Dr Jean-Clément Cabrol said. The Red Cross said it has staff and facilities ready in neighbouring [[Cameroon]] and [[Chad]] to assist. "The whole camp is controlled by the army and no one can come in or out without being checked," said MSF head of emergencies Hugues Robert. Robert added the group knew travel and work in the area was dangerous, and took precautions. 

Helicopters have been evacuating the wounded, including a [[United Nations]] helicopter which brought four medical personnel and 400{{w|kilogram|kg}} (900{{w|pound (mass)|lb}}) of emergency medical aid, and left with eight wounded Red Cross workers. The UN is in the midst of an appeal for aid to the famine-hit region.

Bomb kills at least 50 in Gao, Mali
{{date|January 18, 2017}}
{{politics and conflicts}}
A vehicle packed with explosives was detonated this morning in {{w|Gao, Mali|Gao}}, [[Mali]]. At least fifty died.
[[File:French troops arrive in Mali 130123-F-GO452-629.jpg|thumb|left|250px|File photo of [[France|French]] troops arriving in Mali during the 2013 intervention.{{image credit|Senior Airman James Richardson ({{w|US Air Force}})}}]]
The bombing targeted a camp housing government soldiers and rebels, some of whom were in a meeting at the time. Northern Mali was seized by [[Islam|Islamic]] militants in 2012, with [[France]] leading a military intervention the following year. The camp was formed as part of a disputed ceasefire.

Occasional attacks continue, and the latest is the worst in years. French Interior Minister {{w|Bruno Le Roux}} called the attack "highly symbolic". French President [[François Hollande]] visited the scene last week. 

Victims included people tasked with providing patrols, part of a [[United Nations]]-backed move to quell the violence. Malian President {{w|Ibrahim Boubacar Keita}} took to [[Twitter]] today to declare three days of mourning. His government stands accused by [[Human Rights Watch]] of not taking adequate measures to protect the nation's citizens.

The government says the dead include five suicide bombers. {{w|Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb}} claimed a single bomber from affiliate group {{w|al-Mourabitoun}} conducted the attack.

Syrian peace talks begin in Geneva
{{politics and conflicts}}
{{date|February 26, 2017}}

On Thursday, peace talks between the [[Syria|Syrian]] government and its opposition officially began in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. The talks, organized by the [[United Nations]], aim toward a political solution to the [[Syrian Civil War]] that has lasted for more than five years. 
{{QuoteLeft|I ask you to work together. I know it's not going to be easy<!-- to end this horrible conflict and lay the foundation for a country at peace with itself, sovereign and unified -->|source=Staffan de Mistura, coordinator for the Syrian peace talks}}
[[File:Staffan de Mistura in Astana.png|thumb|left|260px|From file, Staffan de Mistura at related talks last month in Astana, [[Kazakhstan]].  {{image|[[VOA]]}}]]
The peace conference is being held at the {{w|United Nations Office at Geneva|foreign=suppress}}. After an opening ceremony which the opposition delegation nearly missed due to internal disagreements, the UN envoy to Syria {{w|Staffan de Mistura}} formally announced the start of the first day of talks. The government and opposition delegations sat opposite each other with a UN assembly serving as a mediator. 

The two sides, however, failed to directly talk to the other and no negotiations took place on the first day. Staffan de Mistura separately spoke to the opposing representatives. "I ask you to work together. I know it's not going to be easy to end this horrible conflict and lay the foundation for a country at peace with itself, sovereign and unified", he told the assembly. 

The Syrian government delegation was led by {{w|Bashar Jaafari}}, the Syrian representative to the UN. He attended several previous Syrian peace talks.

The opposition delegation mainly consisted of the {{w|High Negotiations Committee}} (HNC), led by {{w|Naser al-Hariri}}. "Today, the real opposition that represents the Syrian people is the HNC. This delegation and the HNC, extends its hand to any national partner that adopts the will of the Syrian people", he said. The HNC is based in [[Saudi Arabia]]. However, two other opposition groups also attended the conference, supported by [[Russia]], which is also a major supporter of the Syrian government. 

In addition to the two political delegations, a group of several Syrian women were also in Geneva. Some of them had relatives arrested, abducted, or otherwise missing during the war.

The talks are held on the basis of {{w|United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254}}, adopted in December 2015, which called for a ceasefire and a political transition in Syria. 

This conference takes place nearly a year after the previous round of Syrian peace talks in Geneva collapsed in 2016. "We do know what will happen if we fail once again &mdash; more deaths, more suffering, more terrorism, more refugees", said de Mistura.

Six aid workers dead in ambush in South Sudan
{{date|March 27, 2017}}
{{South Sudan}}
The [[United Nations]] (UN) has confirmed six aid workers in [[South Sudan]] were killed on Saturday in what the UN representative called a "{{wikt|heinous}} murder."

The attack occurred in a government-controlled section of road as the six workers drove from the capital, {{W|Juba}}, northeast to {{W|Pibor}}. The victims were later found by other members of the humanitarian convoy. UN humanitarian coordinator for South Sudan Eugene Owusu described the attack as "utterly reprehensible". He also expressed his outrage that it occurred while humanitarian needs are higher than they have ever been.

At least twelve aid works have died in South Sudan this year, according to the UN, 79 since the December 2013 outbreak of civil war. This month, the South Sudanese government also announced plans to increase visa fees for humanitarian workers to [[US$]]10,000. <!-- I assume it is USD, please verify -->

Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for South Sudan {{w|David Shearer}} said in response to the attack that humanitarian workers in South Sudan faced more danger than almost any other country. The country's deputy ambassador to the UN, Joseph Moum Malok, has reiterated the government's commitment to assist people affected by famine and civil war, and asked the international community to maintain their involvement.

A UN report obtained by [[Agence France-Presse]] and [[Reuters]] has suggested the government is also continuing to expand its arms stockpile despite the famine, allegations the government denies. A recent outbreak of {{w|cholera}} in parts of the country has exacerbated the crisis and increased pressure on aid workers. UN figures suggest 7.5 million South Sudanese now require humanitarian aid, with one million verging on starvation.

Guatemalan president Jimmy Morales announces move of Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem
{{Politics and conflicts}}{{date|December 25, 2017}}
Yesterday, [[Guatemala|Guatemalan]] President {{w|Jimmy Morales}} announced via a [[Facebook]] post that his country is to move its embassy in [[Israel]] from [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Jerusalem]]. Guatemala became the first nation to follow the [[United States]] in making this decision. Earlier this month, United States president [[Donald Trump]] instructed the {{w|U.S. State Department}} to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

Morales affirmed Guatemala has long supported Israel: {{translated quote|es|Spanish language|Hablamos de las excelentes relaciones que hemos tenido como naciones desde que Guatemala apoyó la creación del Estado de Israel|We spoke of the excellent relations we have had since Guatemala supported the creation of the state of Israel}}, he wrote in the Facebook post. {{translated quote|es|Spanish language|Uno de los temas de mayor relevancia fue el retorno de la Embajada de Guatemala a Jerusalén.|One of the most important issues was the return of the Guatemalan Embassy to Jerusalem.}}

On December 19, the [[United Nations]] voted on a resolution urging the U.S. to reconsider its decision. 128 countries voted in favor of treating decisions to change the status of Jerusalem as "null and void." Nine countries voted against the resolution, 35 countries abstained and 21 did not have a voting representative present. Trump threatened to reduce the amount of foreign aid sent to any nation that supported UN's resolution. He said, "They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us [...] Well, we're watching those votes [...] Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care." Guatemala, which receives funding from the U.S., was one of the nine nations to vote against the resolution.<!--BBC-->

[[Palestine]] claims part of the city, {{w|East Jerusalem}}, as its own territory and Israel claims the entire city to be its capital. Israel came to control East Jerusalem as part of the {{w|Six-day War|1967 Arab-Israeli War}}<!--BBC--> but its legal sovereignty over it has not been recognized by any other nations.

Ukraine passes bill on war-torn eastern regions
{{date|January 20, 2018}}{{Ukraine}}
{{img|filename=Minsk Protocol II.svg|caption=Map of the conflict zone showing lines drawn by the 2015 Minsk agreement.|author=[[c:User:Goran tek-en|Goran tek-en]]}}
On Thursday, the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] {{w|Ukrainian Parliament|Parliament}} passed a new bill called the "Donbass reintegration law". It describes the regions — {{w|Oblasts of Ukraine|oblasts}} — of {{w|Donetsk Oblast|Donetsk}} and {{w|Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk}} as being "temporarily occupied" by [[Russia]] and declares Russia to be the "aggressor". 

The bill calls for a return of the regions to Ukrainian control by military force if necessary. There is no mention of the February 2015 {{w|Minsk II|Minsk agreement}} which was signed by the Ukrainian government and rebel groups, and brokered by [[France]] and [[Germany]].

Ukrainian President {{w|Petro Poroshenko}} stated on {{w|Twitter}}, {{translated quote|ukr|Ukrainian language|Ми продовжуватимемо прокладати шлях для реінтеграції окупованих українських земель політико-дипломатичним шляхом.|We will continue to pave the way for reintegration of the occupied Ukrainian lands through political and diplomatic steps.}} Former Prime Minister {{w|Arseniy Yatsenyuk}} said this forms a legal basis for a {{w|United Nations}} peacekeeping force to "remove the Russian army from Ukrainian territory". Legislator {{w|Ivan Vinnyk}} commented on why the Minsk agreement was not mentioned in the bill: "We can't embed diplomatic and political agreements that are prone to change into the Ukrainian legislation".
{{img|filename=Asia-Europe (ASEM) Summit meeting of the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France, October 2014.jpg|caption=Russian President {{w|Vladimir Putin}} (left) and Poroshenko (right) meet face to face at the ASEM Summit in 2014.|author=[https://www.kremlin.ru Kremlin.ru]}}
Russia's foreign ministry quickly denounced the law and claimed it was proof Ukraine is preparing for a new war. Furthermore, the law "risked a dangerous escalation in Ukraine with unpredictable consequences for world peace and security", the official statement said.

"Kiev has gone from sabotaging the Minsk agreements to burying them," said {{w|Konstantin Kosachev}}, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee for the {{w|Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council}} in Russia. {{w|Alexander Zakharchenko}}, leader of one of the rebel groups in eastern Ukraine, also expressed sharp criticism. Zakharchenko said it was a violation of the Minsk agreement and could lead to an escalation of the armed conflict.

Fighting in eastern Ukraine began shortly after Russia annexed {{w|Crimea}} in 2014 and has by reports claimed over 10,000 lives. About 1.7 million people, ''{{w|Al Jazeera}}'' reports, have been displaced from their homes due to the fighting.

Leader of South Korea requests foreign involvement in decommissioning of nuclear test site
{{date|May 4, 2018}}{{North Korea}}
On Tuesday, [[South Korea]]n President [[Moon Jae-in]] contacted the [[United Nations]] and requested U.N. supervision of the decommissioning of {{w|Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site}}<!--Reuters-->, a subterranean tunnel network beneath {{w|Mount Mantap}} where all six of [[North Korea]]'s nuclear tests took place. North Korean leader [[Kim Jong Un]] reportedly said during April 27's session of the 2018 Inter-korea summit he would invite journalists and other experts from other countries to witness the site's closure.<!--Guardian and NBC news-->
[[File:2018 inter-Korean summit 01.jpg|left|thumb|Kim Jong Un (left) and Moon Jae-in (right) shaking hands on April 27. {{image|{{w|Blue House}}}}]]
A statement issued by the {{w|Blue House}}, the South Korean presidential residence<!--defined in passing in Reuters-->, said President Moon phoned U.N. Secretary General [[António Guterres]] to request the United Nations confirm the shutdown, and Guterres responded, while that specific request had to go through the [[U.N. Security Council|Security Council]] he would assign someone at the U.N. to work with South Korea.<!--Reuters and NHK Japan--> Moon's office also reported Kim Jong Un saying he would invite experts from the [[United States]] and other countries to view the site as it was closed.<!--NBC-->

On April 27, Kim and Moon met at a border village called {{w|Panmunjom}} to discuss relations between their two countries<!--Guardian historic-->.  They emerged with the {{w|Panmunjom Declaration}}, calling for removal of all nuclear weapons from the [[Korean Peninsula]]<!--Guardian and others-->.  According to Moon's spokesperson, Kim told Moon, "If we maintain frequent meetings and build trust with the United States and receive promises for an end to the war and a non-aggression treaty, then why would be need to live in difficulty by keeping our nuclear weapons?"<!--Guardian-->
<!-- [[File:Moon_Jae-in_in_Russia.jpg|right|thumb|Moon Jae-in in July 2017{{image|[http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/by-date/07.07.2017 The Kremlin]}}]] Use left righ to group two images together, we don't want it to appear in sources section-->
[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) officials, in remarks to {{w|NBC News}}, said the IAEA is willing to assist with the decommissioning of Punggye-ri. 

Director {{w|Jeffrey Lewis (academic)|Jeffrey Lewis}} of the {{w|James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies}} described the closure as "of limited value, but it's not meaningless. [...] I would compare it to the blowing up of the cooling tower at {{w|Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center|Yongbyon}} in 2008."<!--NBC-->

Last week, {{w|University of Science and Technology of China|Chinese geologists}} published a report saying the tunnels of Punggye-ri are likely to have partially collapsed after last September's nuclear test, itself of seismic magnitude 6.3 <!--Guardian McCurry "6.3 magnitude tremor"--> and triggering subsequent earthquakes.<!--Guardian McCurry--> Kim said this was not the case: "Some say that we are terminating facilities that are not functioning, but you will see that we have two more tunnels that are bigger than the existing ones and that they are in good condition," again reported through Moon's spokesperson. <!--Guardian-->

"This is a small but welcome step. But, as always, we must take North Korea's actions with appropriate caution," said former United States diplomat {{w|Mintaro Oba}}. "We can't rule out that Kim Jong Un wants to be seen as a maverick. He has a clear taste for bold moves that surprise the international community, something that sets him apart from his father."<!--Guardian-->

"If reports are true that the tunnels have collapsed," said Duyeon Kim of the Korean Peninsula Future Forum think tank, "then the test site would be useless for future nuclear tests anyway, so it would just be a symbolic gesture to close it down[...] It's not a serious or sincere gesture to denuclearize."<!--NBC--> He also observed, "Advanced nuclear states don't need to conduct explosive tests after a certain point, so Pyongyang might be trying to show it is a part of that nuclear club."

Officially, the {{w|Korean War}}, which began in 1950, never ended. There was a cease-fire in 1953 but no formal peace treaty. <!--Guardian Everything Summit-->  At the April 27 summit, the leaders discussed nuclear disarmament, the reuniting of families separated by the partition, and general relations between the two countries.<!--Guardian Hails-->

Kim also announced plans to reverse a 2015 change to North Korea's time zone.  The country's clocks are currently set 30 minutes ahead of South Korea's. "I feel sad to see that there are two clocks hung on the wall of the Peace House, one for Seoul time and the other for Pyongyang time," Moon's spokesperson reported Kim said during the talks. "Since it is us who changed the time standard, we will return to the original one."<!--Guardian-->

Kim Jong Un and [[United States]] President [[Donald Trump]] have spoken of meeting in a few weeks, but no date or location has been firmly announced.<!--Reuters--> <!--NBC--> President Moon plans to visit Pyongyang in person in the fall.<!--Guardian Hails-->

UN releases first-ever human rights report on Kashmir
{{date|June 17, 2018}}{{United Nations}}
On Thursday, the [[United Nations]] (UN) released its first-ever report for [[Kashmir]], highlighting several incidents of alleged [[human rights]] violations in the last two years in the [[India]]n state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as well as [[Pakistan]]i-administered areas of Kashmir, namely [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir]]. The {{w|Indian Ministry of External Affairs}} (MEA) denounced the 49-page report by the UN Office of the {{w|High Commissioner for Human Rights}}, calling it "selective", "malicious" and "fallacious". The report mentions human rights violations including torture, enforced disappearances, sexual violations, administrative detention, violations on the right to health and education, lack of access to justice and arbitrary arrests and detention among others.

{{w|Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein}}, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said he would urge the UN Human Rights Council "to consider establishing a Commission of Inquiry to conduct a comprehensive independent international investigation into allegations of human rights violation in Kashmir". Hussein was not granted permission, by either India or Pakistan, to visit Kashmir for the report.

Per the report, Pakistan was asked to stop "misuse of anti-terror legislation to persecute those engaging in peaceful political and civil activities and those who express dissent." In July 2016, Indian security forces killed the {{w|Hizbul Mujahideen}} leader {{w|Burhan Muzaffar Wani}}, which led to protests in the Kashmir Valley. In response to the protests, Indian security forces fired metallic pellets, and their activities led to human rights violation, the UN report read. It also accused India of the unlawful killing of about 145 civilians since 2016. The report asked India to "fully respect the right of self-determination of the people of Kashmir as protected under international law."

The MEA issued a statement which read: "India rejects the report. It is fallacious, tendentious and motivated. We question the intent in bringing out such a report. It is a selective compilation of largely unverified information. It is overtly prejudiced and seeks to build a false narrative." Per the constitution of Jammu and Kashmir it "is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India" while [[Constitution of Pakistan|Pakistan's constitution]] does not mention Azad Kashmir or Gilgit-Baltistan in its territories, but has a provision for relations with Pakistan subject to Jammu and Kashmir people's decision to acceede to Pakistan. The MEA added in their statement, "Cross-border terror and incitement are aimed at suppressing the will of the people of Jammu & Kashmir, disrupting its political and social fabric and undermining India's integrity".

Unlike India, the report was welcomed by Pakistan. In a press release, the Foreign Office said Pakistan "welcomes the proposal by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish a Commission of Inquiry for [an] international investigation into human rights violations" in Indian-held Kashmir.

Directing towards Indian authorities, the report asked to "urgently repeal the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990; and, in the meantime, immediately remove the requirement for prior central government permission to prosecute security forces personnel accused of human rights violations in civilian courts".

"The report violates India's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The entire state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. Pakistan is in illegal and forcible occupation of a part of the Indian state through aggression. We have repeatedly called upon Pakistan to vacate the occupied territories. The incorrect description of Indian territory in the report is mischievous, misleading and unacceptable. There are no entities such as 'Azad Jammu and Kashmir' and 'Gilgit-Baltistan'", India's External Affairs ministry said in their statement.

The report was welcomed by some activists and leaders in Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir human rights activist Khurram Parvez welcomed the UN report. Kashmiri leader {{w|Mirwaiz Umar Farooq}} wrote on Twitter, "People of Kashmir thank the U.N., especially the bold efforts of its HR commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, for its support to the right of self-determination."

The Kashmir-conflict between India and Pakistan has led to two wars since their independence in 1947. Between 1990 and 2017, there have been about 69,820 militancy-related incidents in Jammu and Kashmir, and more than 41 thousand people were killed. In 2017, there were over 800 ceasefire violations along the heavily-militarised Line of Control in Kashmir between India and Pakistan.

Hungarian Parliament passes bill to criminalise helping undocumented migrants
{{date|June 23, 2018}}{{Crime and law}}
On Wednesday, the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] parliament passed the "Stop Soros" bill, making it illegal to help undocumented immigrants.

The bill was passed by a vote of 160&ndash;18. Per the bill, anyone found guilty of helping undocumented immigrants can potentially face a jail term of up to twelve months. The bill was criticised by human rights-focused organisation [[Amnesty International]], as well as the [[United Nations]] (UN), [[Council of Europe]], {{w|Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe}}, and [[European Union]]. The bill bars non-government organisations from aiding refugees.

The bill is named after Hungarian-born democracy advocate {{W|George Soros}}. Having escaped the [[Holocaust]] and emigrated in 1947, Soros later founded the {{w|Open Society Foundations}} (OSF) which funds various NGOs. Current conservative Prime Minister [[Viktor Orban|Viktor Orbán]], who won the election in April, spoke about immigration and national security in his political campaign. Orbán accused Soros of bringing migrants to Europe. Orbán asserted this blockade was to preserve the country's "[[Christian]] culture". In May, Soros announced OSF was moving from Hungary to [[Germany|German]] capital [[Berlin]], asserting "increasingly repressive" condition in Hungary.

Amnesty internationals's [[Europe|European]] Director {{W|Gauri van Gulik}} said in a statement, "It is a bitter irony that as the world marks World Refugee Day, the Hungarian Parliament voted [...] to introduce a law that targets organizations and individuals who support asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants". According to the UN, the law could come under effect as early as July.

A constitutional amendment was also made, prohibiting "alien population" from living in the country. Hungary's Interior Minister, {{W|Sándor Pintér}}, said, "The Hungarian people rightfully expects the government to use all means necessary to combat illegal immigration and the activities that aid it". He also added, "The Stop Soros package of bills serves that goal, making the organisation of illegal immigration a criminal offence. We want to use the bills to stop Hungary from becoming a country of immigrants".

On Tuesday, 25% taxation of NGOs helping immigrants was proposed by the finance ministry. The ministry, in a statement, said, "The defense against illegal immigration imposes a heavy burden on Hungary's budget, so it indirectly affects the Hungarian people [...] therefore, the government passes that as a manner of burden sharing, the organisations aiding migration should bear additional taxes."

UNHCR ({{W|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}})'s European Bureau director Pascale Moreau said, "Seeking asylum is a fundamental human right, it is not a crime".

International Criminal Court gives Myanmar till July 27 to respond on Rohingya case
{{date|June 24, 2018}}{{Crime and law}}
On Thursday, the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) gave [[Myanmar]] a deadline to respond to a request to extend their jurisdiction over the alleged crimes against the ethnic {{w|Rohingya}}. In the meeting behind closed doors in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], ICC judges decided to set the deadline on July 27.

Myanmar's military is accused of illegal deportation of the minority [[Muslim]] community, as well as committing [[sex crimes]], burning people and villages and killing people belonging to the Rohingya ethnic group. The [[United Nations]] {{w|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|High Commissioner for Human Rights}} has called it "a textbook example of ethnic cleansing". Myanmar denies the accusations. Myanmar is not a member of the international tribunal and hence, ICC do not ordinarily have jurisdiction there.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people have been displaced from their home since August and nearly 700 thousand have settled in [[Bangladesh]]. Unlike Myanmar, Bangladesh is a member of the international tribunal where ICC does have jurisdiction.

In the decision, the ICC said, "Considering that the crime of deportation is alleged to have commenced on the territory of Myanmar, the chamber deems it appropriate to seek observations from the competent authorities of Myanmar on the prosecutor's request".

Palestine elected as G-77's presiding country, ambassador Riyad Mansour confirms
{{date|July 26, 2018}}{{United Nations}}
On Tuesday, [[Riyad Mansour]], [[Palestine]]'s ambassador to the [[United Nations]], confirmed Palestine would preside next year over the UN's {{w|Group of 77|G-77}} bloc of developing countries.

While speaking to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Mansour said, "We will be negotiating on behalf of 135 countries". Formed in 1964, Group of 77 now represents about 80% of the world population. Palestine is expected to take over presiding for 2019 in January. Currently, the presiding nation is [[Egypt]].

Palestine is an observer non-member state of the UN. In 2012, [[Israel]] and its ally the [[United States]] opposed promoting Palestine to "observer" status, and in 2015 both countries also opposed allowing Palestine to fly their flag at the UN.

Israeli ambassador to the UN {{w|Danny Danon}} criticised Palestine's presiding, saying, "The goal of the Group of 77 originally was to facilitate the economic advancement of underdeveloped nations [...] It is unfortunate that it will now become a platform for spreading lies and incitement. This will not promote the G-77's goals, and encourages the Palestinians to not engage in negotiations for peace."

UN Report on Global Warming calls for rapid 'unprecedented' changes globally to limit planetary warming to 1.5 degree C
{{date|October 10, 2018}} 
{{environment}}
The {{W|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}} (IPCC), a [[United Nations]] organization, released its {{W|Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5ºC}} (SR15)  on Monday, during its 48th session held in {{W|Incheon}}, [[South Korea]]. In this report, the panel called for rapid "unprecedented" changes globally to limit [[global warming|planetary warming]] to 1.5&deg;{{w|Celsius|C}} (2.7&deg;{{w|Fahrenheit|F}}) above pre-industrial levels, saying failure to do so would result in increased {{w|sea level}} rise and higher frequency of {{w|extreme weather}} events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. 
[[File:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|thumb|left|Emblem of the United Nations. {{image|[[w:User:Spiff~enwiki|Spiff]]}}]]
The report examined the possibility of limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5ºC, as sought in the {{W|Paris Agreement}} &mdash; a landmark agreement in which global leaders united to combat climate change &mdash; as well as the consequences of failure to do so. The final report was produced by a team of 91 scientists from 40 countries and based on assessments of 6,000 available scientific studies.

The [[New Delhi]]-based {{w|Centre for Science and Environment}} said the impact of 1.5°C warming presented in the report is plainly larger than expected.  The most vulnerable countries were coastal or economically agriculture-dependent, such as [[India]], where poverty reportedly could increase as crop yields decline and unprecedented climate extremes would take place. One of the working groups' co-chairs, Debra Roberts, called the report the "largest clarion bell from the science community". The report indicated that without an increase in current climate change initiatives, by 2030 with 1.5°C, {{w|Environmental issues with coral reefs|coral reefs}} would decline by 70&ndash;90% and be substantially lost &mdash; over 99% &mdash; at 2ºC. According to the report, the {{w|Climate change mitigation|mitigation}} projects already taking place globally would need to be taken to an unprecedented scale.

Turkey's President Erdogan proposes converting Hagia Sophia Museum to mosque
{{date|March 31, 2019}}
{{Turkey}}

On Wednesday, as a part of his pre-election campaign, the [[Turkey|Turkish]] President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ]] pledged converting {{W|Hagia Sophia}}, formerly a {{w|Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox}} church and now a museum, to a [[Islam|mosque]], following the election today. He announced this change by live television on Wednesday and again verbally in a rally on Friday, despite criticism by the Greek foreign minister and {{W|UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization}} (UNESCO) who questioned his authority to make the change.
[[File:Erdoğan (cropped version, 2018).jpg|thumb|left|Recep Tayyip Erdogan. {{image source|kremlin.ru}}]]
[[File:Hagia Sophia Mars 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Hagia Sophia {{image source|[[User:ArildV|Arild Vågen]]}}]]

On Friday in [[Istanbul]], as a part of an election rally,  Erdogan said, "After elections, we will change Hagia Sophia's name from museum to mosque[...] We have some plans and we are going to implement these plans." Earlier this week on Wednesday on the live television, President Erdogan said &mdash; as reported by ''{{w|Hurriyet Daily News}}'' &mdash; "Ayasofya [Haghia Sophia] will no longer be called a museum. Its status will change. We will call it a mosque".

This Wednesday Greek Foreign Minister George Katrougalos emphasized the requirement of approval by UNESCO, saying "It [Haghia Sophia] is not only a great temple of {{w|Christianity|Christendom}} — the largest for many centuries — it also belongs to humanity. It has been recognized by UNESCO, as part of our global cultural heritage. So any questioning of this status is not just an insult to the sentiments of Christians, it is an insult to the international community and international law", as quoted by ''{{w|Greek Reporter}}''. In an interview with ''{{w|Sputnik News}}'', UNESCO also said that this change would require its approval.

This Thursday the {{W|United States Commission on International Religious Freedom}} (USCIRF) also criticized the move, this time not only implying approval would be required, but also recommending to maintain the status of the monument as a museum. They released a statement which said, "Hagia Sophia bears profound historical and spiritual significance to Muslims and Christians alike, and its status as a museum must be maintained".

On live television Erdogan also attacked the proclamation of {{W|Golan Heights}} as official {{w|Israel|Israeli}} territory by the President of the United States {{W|Donald Trump}}, which was made on Monday. This proclamation contradicted the {{w|United Nations}}' official position on status of the territory, which belonged to Syria and was occupied by Israel. 

Namely, President Erdogan said on Wednesday, "Those who remain silent when Masjid Al-Aqsa is attacked, trampled, its windows smashed, cannot tell us what to do about the status of Ayasofya[...] Unfortunately, Trump is behaving like a bully boy[...] How can you do this despite the United Nations? What are you doing? Being at the helm of a state like the U.S. does not give you such a right." 

Erdogan also said earlier he might rename the monument.  On the live television he said, "{{W|Constantinople}} will never exist again[...] The name of this area is Islambol [full of Islam] and you know that." UNESCO reportedly said a change of name of a world heritage site would required approval from the {{W|World Heritage Committee}}.

UNESCO, a specialized agency of the United Nations, is based in {{w|Paris}}.

Nine hundred thousand Somalis face food crisis
{{date|July 4, 2005}}

[[Image:Flooding in Somalia.jpg|right|260px|Flooding in Somalia during 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]
According to a report from the [[UN]] {{w|Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs}} (OCHA), 500,000 [[Somalia]]ns are directly affected by a drought, around 400,000 are internally displaced, and an additional 12,000 Somalians had been affected by seasonal {{w|flood|flooding}} in the central regions of {{w|Hiraan}} and {{w|Middle Shabelle}} as well as in 
the self-declared northwestern republic of [[Somaliland]].

"Overall, the extended effects of four years of drought, which adversely impacted livelihoods and coping mechanisms, combined with chronic food insecurity, and more recently flooding has exacerbated the suffering of Somalis," said the report.

[[Image:Malnourished child in Somalia.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Malnourished child in Hargeysa, Somalia in April.]]
OCHA estimates that around 44,000 people were directly affected by the {{w|tsunami}}, and many still need urgent humanitarian assistance, the agency said.  An estimated figure released by OCHA stated that $162,266,738 would be needed to be raised to target an estimated 900,000 vulnerable people. As of June 10, donors had funded approximately 39 percent of this appeal.

The December {{w|Indian Ocean Tsunami}} devastated the northeastern Somali coastline, further worsening the humanitarian situation now seen in Somalia. Good seasonal rains in Somalia which have ended a four-year drought have done little to help the estimated 900,000 Somalians in need of humanitarian aid.

Israel declines appeals to sign Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
{{date|May 30, 2010}}
{{Israel}}[[File:Portrait of Benjamin Netanyahu.jpg|thumb|left|Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2009 {{image source|Official White House Photo by Lawrence Jackson}}]]
On Friday, the 189 Parties to the {{w|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty}} (NPT) agreed to a final resolution calling for steps toward the banning of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in the [[Middle East]]. The resolution directs [[United Nations]] {{w|Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General}} [[Ban Ki-Moon]] to organize a conference of all the Middle East states.

The resolution singles out [[Israel]], calling on "all states in the Middle East that have not yet done so to accede to the treaty as non-nuclear weapon states so as to achieve its universality at an early date." In an official statement from the Prime Minister's Office, Israel said the resolution, "is deeply flawed and hypocritical. It ignores the realities of the Middle East and the real threats facing the region and the entire world." The statement went on to state, "[the resolution] singles out Israel, the Middle East's only true democracy and the only country threatened with annihilation. Yet the terrorist regime in [[Iran]], which is racing to develop nuclear weapons and which openly threatens to wipe Israel off the map, is not even mentioned in the resolution."

An Arab-backed proposal for a WMD-Free zone in the Middle East, supported in 1995 by the NPT Conference, was never acted upon.

As a non-signatory state, Israel is not bound by any resolutions of the NPT.

Six die in Nigeria church shooting
{{date|January 7, 2012}}
{{Nigeria}}
Six people have died after a {{w|Mass murder|shooting incident}} Thursday in a {{w|Deeper Christian Life Ministry|Deeper Life}} [[Christianity|church]] located in {{w|Gombe, Nigeria|Gombe}}, in the north east of [[Nigeria]]. Gombe state police spokesman Ahmed Muhammad reported that eight other individuals had also been wounded during the shootings.

The wife of the pastor of the church was amongst those killed in the attack, which happened as a prayer service was in progress. Theresa Munyok, self-identified as daughter and brother of two of those shot dead, spoke of the events which occurred. "The only thing I heard was my mommy shouting," Munyok explained. "She told me that it was gunshots and that my dad is not even breathing. She called and called and he did not wake up," she said.

No groups were reported to have claimed responsibility for the incident. It is reportedly suspected that [[Boko Haram]], a [[Muslim]] sect, carried out the attack. On Sunday, an individual presumed to be a representative of Boko Haram gave a warning to the Christian citizens of the north of Nigeria, which is mainly Muslim, ordering them to depart from the region within three days. ''Boko Haram'' translates from {{w|Hausa language|Hausa}} to English as 'Western education is {{w|Sacrilege|sacrilege}}'. The group was reportedly responsible in 2011 for over five hundred killings. The group accepted responsibility for the attack of a {{w|Catholicism|Catholic}} church near the Nigerian capital [[Abuja]] on [[Christmas Day]], in which at least 37 people died, as well as a suicide bombing at a [[United Nations]] building in the same city, where 25 people were killed as a result.

[[Goodluck Jonathan]], the president of Nigeria, placed various areas of the country in a state of emergency on December 31, 2011, including areas in {{w|Yobe State|Yobe}}, {{w|Plateau State|Plateau}}, {{w|Borno State|Borno}} and {{w|Niger State|Niger state}}. Gombe was not included amongst these states. Authorities in these areas can now arrest individuals without requiring evidence to do so. Similarly, searches can be made by authorities without requiring warrants to do so.

Clinton warns North Korea of "provocative behavior"
{{date|May 22, 2010}}{{Politics and conflicts}}[[Hillary Clinton]] yesterday warned [[North Korea]] of "consequences" for its role in the sinking of a [[South Korea]]n warship, calling the North's actions "provocative behavior."

Clinton made her remarks after a meeting in [[Japan]] with the country's foreign minister, at the start of a trip through [[Asia]].  She said that "[i]t is important to send a clear message to North Korea that provocative actions have consequences.  We cannot allow this attack on South Korea to go unanswered by the international community."

She declined to comment on what the consequences may be, although officials from the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration said that they would include intervention from the [[United Nations]] [[UN Security Council|Security Council]], a plan also expected to be part of South Korea's response to the incident, as well as increased naval activity around the [[Korean peninsula]] involving both the [[US|American]] and South Korean navies.

Clinton also said that any response would have to come from the global community at large, rather than just one or two countries.  "Let me be clear: this will not, and cannot, be business as usual.  There must be an international, not just a regional, but an international response."

Iran's President Rouhani tells foreign powers to leave Persian Gulf
{{date|September 23, 2019}}{{Middle East infobox}}
Yesterday<!--Sunday-->, President [[Hassan Rouhani]] of [[Iran]] said if the goal is peace and security, then foreign powers should "get out of the region" as their presence could cause an arms race. He also announced a new security initiative for the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Gulf of Oman]] and the [[Strait of Hormuz]] to be unveiled at the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] later this week.

[[File:Rouhani - Sacred Week - 22 Sep 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Rouhani delivering the speech {{Image|Vahid Ahmadi/{{w|Tasnim News Agency|TNA}}}}]]
Rouhani was speaking at the opening of {{w|Sacred Defence Week}}, an annual commemoration of the eight-year {{w|Iran–Iraq War}}, which features military parades. "The presence of foreign forces can be dangerous for the region, international waters, as well as the security of shipping lines and energy, but our path is to create unity and coordination with regional countries," he said. "Those who want to link the region’s incidents to the Islamic Republic of Iran are lying like their past lies that have been revealed [...] If they are truthful and really seek security in the region, they must not send weapons, fighter jets, bombs and dangerous arms to the region."

"Your presence has always been a calamity for this region and the farther you go from our region and our nations, the more security would come for our region", he continued in the speech which was delivered in [[Tehran]], the capital. Rouhani's new security plan would be led by Iran and feature support from regional countries<!--BBC and AP translated this quite differently but the same meaning, so no quote--> in securing the waterways in the region. According to the [[Associated Press]], Iran has increased cooperation in the last few years with the navies of [[China]], [[India]], [[Oman]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Russia]].

The speech came approximately one week after an attack on oil infrastructure in [[Saudi Arabia]] which halved Saudi oil output. The attack was claimed by the {{w|Houthi movement}} in [[Yemen]], but both Saudi Arabia and the [[United States]] have alleged Iranian involvement. The initial reports were of drone attacks, but the Saudi government said the attack included {{w|cruise missile|cruise missles}} which could not have originated in Yemen.<!--BBC video caption - maybe need java on-->

The United States was more forceful in blaming Iran for the attack, committing to send more troops to Saudi Arabia. Recently, the United States announced a naval coalition to patrol the Persian Gulf which was joined by [[Australia]], [[Bahrain]], Saudi Arabia, the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

The annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly is set to open tomorrow<!--Tuesday-->.

Fiancée of murdered Saudi journalist demands justice at UN General Assembly
{{date|September 29, 2019}}{{Saudi Arabia}}
On Thursday, Hatice Cengiz, fiancée of journalist {{w|Jamal Khashoggi}}, addressed reporters in [[New York, New York|New York]], [[New York State|New York]], calling for the killers of Khashoggi to be brought to justice. Cengiz traveled to New York for the [[United Nations]] (UN) [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] which took place this week. Khashoggi was murdered last October in the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] consulate in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. Hatice Cengiz is a Turkish national now living in [[London]].

The previous day, television broadcaster {{w|PBS}} revealed that in December, Crown Prince {{w|Mohammad bin Salman}} of [[Saudi Arabia]] accepted responsibility for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi but did not say he'd ordered it.  Speaking to {{w|Martin Smith (documentarian)|Martin Smith}} of PBS, he said, "It happened under my watch. I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch." The official position remained that {{wikt|rogue}} operatives within the Saudi government committed the murder. According to [[Reuters]] and [[NBC]], Mohammad bin Salman is the ''{{wikt|de facto}}'' Saudi ruler.

Cengiz called Mohammad's admission a "political maneuver." She explained, "By confessing this, he's also distancing himself from the killing of Jamal [...] He's saying that it happened under his watch but he means he is not involved in this crime." She credited news media with keeping the story alive. Speaking to ''NBC News'', she said, "His fellow journalists did their best that so no one could push this under the carpet [...] But at the end of the day, all of these efforts did not persuade world leaders to sanction Saudi Arabia. That is so sad".

"What is so sad for me", Cengiz said, "is not seeing the punishment of the perpetrators [...] Imagine that the entire world remains silent over Jamal's killing. This silence and inertia created huge disappointment on my side."

{{w|Agnès Callamard}}, a UN {{wikt|anchor=English|rapporteur}} for the {{w|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights}} who had investigated the case, cautioned justice does not come swiftly. "True justice takes time and I know it's painful, but that's the reality of the world we live in," she said, asking Cengiz to be "patient and resilient."

The [[CIA]] and other intelligence agencies reportedly believe the crown prince ordered Khashoggi's killing. Callamard encouraged the CIA to release the files from their investigation. A closed-door trial is underway in Saudi Arabia in which eleven individuals have been charged with the murder, however Callamard did not give it any credence.

Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi national, was a columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and he lived in self-imposed exile in [[Virginia]] as a legal resident of the [[United States]]. He entered the consulate in Istanbul on October 2 2018, seeking documents allowing him to marry Turkish national Hatice Cengiz. He never came out. Saudi Arabia initially denied all claims that Khashoggi was slain, however, a UN report eventually concluded evidence supported his murder and dismemberment inside the consulate by Saudi agents. To date, his remains had not been recovered.

Greta Thunberg named 2019 Time Person of the Year
{{Environment}}
{{date|December 14, 2019}}

On Wednesday, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine announced its selection of [[climate change]] activist {{w|Greta Thunberg}} as their 2019 "[[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]]". The sixteen-year-old [[Sweden|Swede]] is currently the youngest recipient of the 92-year-old award. Thunberg received the award, with which ''Time'' credits an individual as having done "for better or for worse [...] the most to influence the events of the year", for her work drawing attention to the issue of climate change.
[[File:Greta Thunberg au parlement européen (33744056508), recadré.png|thumb|left|Thunberg in April 2019 {{image|European Parliament}}]]

Thunberg began her climate protest on August 20, 2018, at the age of fifteen,<!--NBC--> outside of the [[Riksdag|Swedish Parliament]], instead of attending school. She protested alone on the first day, but thousands of Swedes eventually joined the protest. That September, the {{w|Fridays for Future}} movement launched; Thunberg promised protests every week until Sweden joined the {{w|Paris Agreement}}. Other countries had similar protests, with 35 thousand students protesting in [[Belgium]] in January of this year.<!--All TIME, except age-->

Thunberg then led, according to ''Time'', the largest climate change demonstration ever held to date, on September 20 of this year. An estimated four million people overall took part in the protests. This included marches of 250 thousand protesters in [[New York City]], 100 thousand in [[London]], and 1.4 million in cities throughout [[Germany]]. ''Time'' reported some were using the slogan "Make the World Greta Again".<!--All TIME-->

In her campaign, Thunberg has met with multiple world leaders advocating climate change action, including giving an address at the [[United Nations]], meeting with [[Roman Catholic]] [[Pope Francis]], and speaking to the [[United States Congress]]. Her influence also resulted in a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] nomination.<!--mostly TIME--> 

According to ''[[NBC]]'', ''Time'' also considered the United States Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]], United States President [[Donald Trump]], [[2019 Hong Kong protests|protesters in Hong Kong]] over Chinese extradition, and a United States whistleblower who revealed an alleged illicit interaction between Trump and [[Ukraine|Ukraine]] {{w|President of Ukraine|President}} [[Volodymyr Zelensky]].<!--NBC-->

New videotape of Ayman al-Zawahiri aired on Aljazeera
{{date|June 9, 2006}}
[[Image:Zawahiri.jpg|right|190px|thumb|Ayman al-Zawahiri.]]
[[Al-Qaeda]]'s second in command, {{w|Ayman al-Zawahiri}}, has released a new videotape. The {{w|Arabic language|Arabic}} television network [[Al Jazeera]] has aired the tape.

On the tape, al-Zawahiri said, "{{w|Allah|God}} bless the {{w|Muhammad|prophet}} of [[Islam]] in [[Iraq]], the persistent hero of Islam, the Holy Warrior {{w|Abu Musab al-Zarqawi}}." According to Al Jazeera, the tape was made before the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq.

During the broadcast, al-Zawahiri talks to the general Muslim population saying, "I call upon them to reject any referendum on [[Palestine]], because Palestine is not for bargaining or bidding. Palestine was a land of Islam, and its liberation is the duty of every Muslim. I call upon Muslims everywhere to support the brothers in Palestine."

Al-Zawahiri also claims that the [[United Nations]] is trying to "occupy" [[Sudan]] and is attempting to "divide" the nation.

"The spineless Sudanese government ... is joining the [[United States]] in dividing Sudan to stay in power. In Sudan, the crusader (U.N.) [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] decided to send military experts to Darfur in preparation for its occupation and division. I call upon every Muslim and everyone who has faith in Sudan, and every fervent Muslim in [[Darfur]] to confront the {{w|Zionist}} Crusader plot to occupy the lands of Islam," added al-Zawahiri.

Zawahiri also talks about judges in [[Egypt]] who wish to make the judiciary system independent.

"In Egypt, the crusader system supports the {{w|secular}} system that violates the judges' integrity, cheats in elections and enforces emergency law. Oh judges, you won't obtain independence unless your country is liberated first, and our home will not be liberated unless Islamic [[Sharia]] [law] is implemented. The regime won't give you your independence because to do so would be to kill itself," said Zawahiri, who was addressing the Egyptian judges.

"I have to be frank with you. You are part of the problem. You agreed on the constitution and the secular laws imposed on the nation by arms and suppression and torture and rigged elections. I tell the Egyptian judges you will not gain independence because America and [[Israel]] simply and clearly do not want that, and what you see today in procedures against you is part of their promised American reform plan," added Zawahiri.

Zawahiri also talks about the aid to the {{w|Palestinian government}}, which has been frozen. "The Arab governments did not have the courage to even meet the Palestinians' needs for one month. Because the orders came from <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Washington D.C.]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> to their agents to starve the Palestinians and to isolate them," added Zawahiri.

The videotape is approximately 17 minutes long and it is unknown where Al Jazeera got the tape.

Thousands flee violence in northern Democratic Republic of the Congo
{{date|November 8, 2009}}
{{Democratic Republic of the Congo}}[[File:LocationDRCongo.svg|thumb|left|280px|[[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]{{Image source|[[commons:User:Rei-artur|Rei-artur]]}}]]The {{w|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}} (UNHCR) reports more than 16,000 civilians have fled ethnic violence in the northern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC). The UNHCR says the refugees crossed the {{w|Ubangi River|Oubangui River}} into neighboring [[Republic of Congo]] to find safety after their villages were burned.

The [[UN]] refugee agency reported that the mass exodus from the DRC's remote Equateur Province took place last week. It says ethnic clashes broke out between the Enyele and Munzaya tribes over farming and fishing rights in the village of Dongo.

UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic said that 60 people were killed, and the deadly fighting spread to surrounding villages, several of which were burned. He says 40 other people were seriously injured and some are being treated in hospital.

"The 16,000 DRC asylum seekers&mdash;who are mainly Munzayas&mdash;are staying in public buildings or with host communities across 11 villages alongside the Oubangui River," he said.

"A UNHCR team is now visiting them and our initial assessment is that they need proper shelter, food and household items such as blankets, kitchen sets and jerry cans. Since a thorough assessment is made, we will work together with the government to help them. Some are also in need of medical care, but an over-stretched mobile clinic run by a UNHCR partner cannot cope with all their needs at the moment," he added.

The first clashes between the Enyele and Munzaya occurred in March. More than 200 houses were burned in the village of Munzaya, and more than 1,200 residents fled to safety in the Republic of Congo.

Mahecic reported that the UNHCR is very concerned about the intensity of the violence and its spread to nearby villages. He says the villages have been virtually emptied of their inhabitants.

He says this latest violence, which is taking place in the west of the DRC is unrelated to fighting going on in the east, which has displaced 1.7 million people within the country.

Before the current influx, the UNHCR spokesman said the Republic of Congo already was hosting some 9,000 refugees from the DRC who had previously fled there to escape civil war in their country.

According to Mahecic, when the DRC's civil war formally ended in 2003, large numbers of refugees returned home. But, he says this last group of 9,000 refugees does not want to return to the homes they fled in the DRC. They say they wish to settle permanently in the Republic of Congo.

Fire ravages large academic library in Moscow
{{date|February 1, 2015}}
{{Russia}}
[[File:Fire in the library of the INION 2015-01-31 4351.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Firefighters in front of the partially destroyed building.{{image|[[Commons:User:Putnik|Sergey Leschina]]}}]]
A fire Friday night and Saturday morning caused major damage to the {{w|Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Scientific Information on Social Sciences}} in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. It is among the nation's largest academic libraries.

The fire began at 10p.m. {{w|UTC+3|local time}} on the third floor, damaging much of one wing. <!--see photos, especially the aerial ones; the fire is clearly largely in one wing--> {{w|Russian Academy of Sciences}} boss Vladimir Fortov called it "a great loss to science". He said around 15% of the library's 14.2 million books and other documents are likely damaged.

''{{w|RT (TV network)|Russia Today}}'' said 147 personnel battled the blaze with 38 vehicles. The emergency ministry puts the number of firefighters at over 200. The blaze left no injuries and was contained by around midnight.
[[File:Fire in the library of the INION 2015-01-31 4371.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A close-up of the damaged roof as firefighting work continues{{image|[[Commons:User:Putnik|Sergey Leschina]]}}]]
Thought to have escaped the fire are the library's collection of rare and ancient Slavic manuscripts. Other documents housed include Russia's largest repository of articles from the [[United Nations]] and {{w|UNESCO}} in particular, and UN precursor the {{w|League of Nations}}. Large numbers of other documents in old and modern languages from across Asia and Europe are on-site, as are reports from national legislatures. Parliamentary documents held include [[Italy|Italian]] documents from 1897, [[US]] documents from 1789, and [[UK]] documents from 1803.

Founded in 1918 and boasting 49,000 readers served by 330 staff, the library has lost around 2,000 square metres. The roof has partially collapsed. [[Arson]] has been ruled out with an official telling ''{{w|Ria Novosti}}'' an electrical fault is considered likely.

Over 270 civilians reported killed from shelling in Syria
{{date|June 6, 2016}}
{{Syria}}
More than 270 civilians were killed in 24 hours from militant shelling in {{w|Syrian}} cities according to a report on Saturday from the {{w|Russia|Russian}} Center for Reconciliation of the Opposing Sides in Syria. The report, published on the Russian Defense Ministry website, also stated that hundreds of civilians have been injured.<!-- TASS -->
[[File:Aleppo Syria.png|thumb|left|The location of Aleppo in Syria.]]
In a message directed to the {{w|UN}}'s {{w|UN Secretary General|Secretary General}} and {{w|UN Security Council|Security Council}} head, the Syrian Foreign and Expatriates Ministry reported the attacks came from "moderate" opposition groups that were joining the {{w|Al-Nusra Front}} and its affiliates in {{w|Aleppo}}, Syria. According to the Center on Saturday, one of the opposition groups, {{w|Ahram al-Sham}}, joined the Al-Nusra Front for an attack against {{w|Kurds|Kurdish}} militias, which effectively forced Kurds to retreat from their positions in the city on Saturday. <!-- RT June 6, RT June 4 -->

The militants' reported new offensive took place in a cessation of Russian and Syrian warplane activity beginning over a week earlier, which enabled the militants to regroup. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the cessation was meant to permit groups coordinating with the {{w|United States}} and Russia to separate themselves from the the Al-Nusra Front. <!-- Al Jazeera May 31 -->

However, Russia's foreign minister, {{w|Sergey Lavrov}}, said on television that the United States had requested Russia avoid targeting the Al-Nusra Front, which has affiliations with {{w|al-Qaeda}}. In response, a {{w|US State Department}} spokesperson stated on Friday that the request was to avoid targeting civilians or legitimate opposition. <!-- Washington Post -->

Egyptian-mediated ceasefire between Israel and armed factions in Gaza starts
{{date|August 6, 2014}}{{Palestine}}
At 8 o'clock yesterday morning, {{w|UTC+3|local time}}, a 72 hour ceasefire between the [[Israel|Israeli]] [[Israel Defence Force|military]] and the armed factions in the [[Gaza Strip]] began.  The ceasefire was achieved due to the initiative and efforts of [[Egypt|Egyptian]] mediators, who invited delegations from both sides to meet in [[Cairo]] and discuss the conditions for a long-term treaty.

A few minutes before the ceasefire came into effect, several Israeli strikes were reported across the Gaza Strip, and a number of rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel.
{{QuoteLeft|We hope they can take it and be committed to a cease-fire|4=Hamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan}}
A Palestinian delegation reportedly including representatives from [[Fatah]], [[Hamas]], and the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]], and an Israeli delegation, reportedly traveled to Cairo to discuss conditions for a long term ceasefire agreement.  Palestinian delegate Qais Abdul Karim, "Abu Laila", said, "Egyptian officials, headed by intelligence chief, showed understanding to our demands, but they said they play the role of mediator and will transfer these demands to the Israeli side."

Spokespersons on behalf of both sides told [[CNN]] the ceasefire must be respected.  Hamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan said: "We hope they can take it and be committed to a cease-fire".  Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] said Israeli wants "quiet and security [for] the citizens of Israel".
{{QuoteLeft|the aim of this initiative is to allow us to see if a ceasefire could be reached over a longer period of time|4=White House deputy national security advisor [[Tony Blinken]]}}
In this latest conflict, over 1,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza officials, and 67 Israelis have died. Several prior ceasefire initiatives have been violated, with counter-accusations about which side dragged the other into fighting.

The [[UN]] gladly accepted the current Egyptian initiative and [[Ban Ki-moon]], UN's secretary general, called for talks to commence in Cairo as soon as possible.  The [[US]] [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House]] has also expressed its support, and White House deputy national security advisor Tony Blinken said, quoted [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], "the aim of this initiative is to allow us to see if a ceasefire could be reached over a longer period of time".

International Criminal Court to investigate war crimes in Palestine
{{date|March 5, 2021}}{{Palestine}}
On Wednesday, Chief prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) {{w|Fatou Bensouda}} announced her office's decision to formally investigate alleged war crimes in [[Palestine]].  The investigation is to be led by [[UK|British]] lawyer {{w|Karim Ahmad Khan}}, who is scheduled to replace Bensouda as chief prosecutor on June 16.
[[File:Armored Vehicles Near the Gaza Border-july-22-2014-operation-protective-edge.jpg|left|thumb|Armoured vehicles near the Gaza border. (Source: Israel Defense Forces)]]

Bensouda said "[t]he decision to open an investigation followed a painstaking preliminary examination undertaken by my office that lasted close to five years".  Bensouda promised a "principled, non-partisan, approach" for the case and said the case will be handled "independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favor."  The preliminary examination was conducted in December 2019, finding "[[war crimes]] have been or are being committed in the [[West Bank]], including {{w|East Jerusalem}}, and the [[Gaza Strip]]".

The chief prosecutor said the probe will focus on alleged war crime committed since June 13, 2014, a few weeks before the Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip.  Bensouda said the priorities of investigation are to be "determined in due time".  She named both Israeli Defense Forces as well as Palestinian militant group [[Hamas]] as the potential perpetrators.

Palestine is a member of the ICC since 2015 and has long accused Israel for war crimes.  Israel is not a member of the ICC and claims the court has no jurisdiction over Palestinian Territories because Palestine is not sovereign.<!-- can't find in sources US said the same -->

Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] called ICC's decision "the essence of anti-Semitism and hypocrisy" and said the court was "turning a blind eye to [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and the other dictatorships that are committing real war crimes."

In the statement Netanyahu also said: "Without any jurisdiction, it decided that our brave soldiers, who take every precaution to avoid civilian casualties against the worst terrorists in the world who deliberately target civilians, it's our soldiers who are war criminals".  He has promised to "fight for the truth until we annul this scandalous decision".  Israeli Foreign Minister {{w|Gabi Ashkenazi}} called the ICC's decision "morally bankrupt and legally flawed".

Spokesperson from the {{w|United States Department of State|U.S. State Department}} {{w|Ned Price}} said "[w]e will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security".  Price also said ICC "has no jurisdiction over this matter".  Israeli ambassador to the U.S. {{w|Gilad Erdan}} promised to "continue working together" with the US.<!-- we need full quote -->

The United States, also a non-member of the organisation, has targeted sanctions against the prosecutor's office under former US President [[Donald Trump]]. {{w|American Israel Public Affairs Committee}} urged current US President [[Joe Biden]] to keep the sanctions in place calling this move by ICC "illegitimate, politically motivated investigation".<!-- need full quote -->  The United States also opposes the ICC investigation on U.S. forces in [[Afghanistan]].

The {{w|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates (State of Palestine)|Foreign Ministry}} of the [[Palestinian National Authority]], which exercises authority in the West Bank, called the decision "a long-awaited step that serves Palestine's tireless pursuit of justice and accountability", while also asking nations not to politicise "these independent proceedings".

Spokesperson for [[Hamas]] Hazem Qassem, who had asserted rocket attacks fired on Israel in 2014 were legal under international law, said: "we welcomed the ICC decision to investigate Israeli occupation war crimes against our people".  Qassem also told the [[Associated Press]] it "is a step forward to implement justice, punish the occupation, and do justice to the Palestinian people". 

According to the estimates by the [[United Nations]], 2200 Palestinians including 1500 civilians were killed in the [[2014 Gaza war]], referred to as Operation Protective Edge in Israel.  According to Israeli estimates at least 73 Israelis including six civilians were killed in that operation.

The Israeli government has conducted public relations and diplomatic campaigns in an attempt to prevent the investigation, The Associated Press reported.

North Korean Research Institute for Nutrition Care of Children director slams UN's report on child malnutrition due to COVID-19
{{date|April 9, 2021}}{{North Korea}}
[[File:North Korea on the globe (North Korea centered).svg|thumb|left|North Korea on a map.{{image|[[c:User:Addicted04|Addicted04]]}}]]
On Tuesday, a statement released by the {{w|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korea}} heavily criticised a report made by the [[United Nations]] on {{w|Undernutrition in children|child malnutrition}} in [[North Korea]], which found around 100 thousand children in North Korea are suffering from malnutrition.  This malnutrition crisis is in part caused by [[COVID-19]] border closures, according to ''{{w|The Korea Times}}''.

In the statement, the director of the Research Institute for Nutrition Care of Children, which is a part of the {{w|Academy of Sciences of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Academy of Medical Science of the DPRK}}, described the report as "a sheer lie", "seriously distorted" and being "a black-hearted act of hostility to tarnish the image of our country". The statement further added: In our country, nutrition care of children is deemed a top priority despite difficult conditions and insufficiency. [...] But those self-styled experts wearing the berets of UN are distorting the situation of our country in order to create an impression that serious "malnutrition of children" exists in our country.

UN's report published on March 10 used the observations of {{w|Tomás Ojea Quintana}}, {{w|United Nations special rapporteur|special rapporteur}} on the matter of {{w|human rights in North Korea}}.  In the report, Quintana said COVID-19 led to deaths by starvation following the decline in business.  UN's report mentioned "several individuals who were caught breaking anti-epidemic prevention measures were reportedly executed in public".  These alleged executions are said to have taken place in cities including the country's capital city, [[Pyongyang]], where a man was allegedly executed for having partaken in 'illicit trade' with [[China]], the report elaborated.

In a ''The Korea Times'' article, an unnamed non-governmental organisation said "approximately 440 thousand children and pregnant and lactating women will not receive {{w|micronutrients}}, approximately 95 thousand acutely malnourished children will not receive necessary treatment and approximately 101 thousand kindergarten-aged children will not receive {{w|Food fortification|fortified foods}}".

Border restrictions in North Korea have been implemented as a way to stop the spread of COVID-19, but the restrictions have caused shortages of necessary goods such as medicine, [[Reuters]] reported quoting Russia's diplomatic mission to North Korea.  These shortages have caused an "exodus" of foreign diplomats leaving North Korea, the same report added.

Austrian Airlines cancels Moscow-bound flight after Russia refuses a reroute outside Belarusian airspace
{{Transport}}{{date|May 29, 2021}}
[[File:Торунь. Акцыя салідарнасці з Беларуссю (2021-05-24) 2.jpg|thumb|left|Protests on May 24, showing solidarity with Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich. {{image|[[c:User:Паўлюк Шапецька|User:Паўлюк Шапецька]]}}]]
{{w|Austrian Airlines}} cancelled cargo-passenger flight OS601 from [[Vienna]] bound for [[Moscow]]'s {{w|Moscow Domodedovo Airport|Domodedovo Airport}} on Thursday after authorities in [[Russia]] refused to accept a new proposed route to its capital city which bypassed [[Belarus]]ian airspace.

Following the grounding of a [[Ryanair]] flight on Sunday from [[Greece]] to [[Lithuania]]; in [[Minsk]], Belarus, over a bomb scare and subsequent arrest of opposition journalist {{w|Roman Protasevich}} and his girlfriend {{w|Sofia Sapega}}, the [[European Union]] imposed sanctions on Belarus.  Many air carriers in [[Europe]] including Austrian Airlines have been avoiding to fly over the Belarusian airspace and using Belarusian airports after sanctions were imposed.

An Austrian Airlines official told {{w|TASS}}, because it "has suspended flights over Belarusian airspace until further notice [...] it is also necessary to adjust the flight route from Vienna to Moscow.  The change in the flight path must be approved by the authorities.  Russian officials did not give their approval to us."

The representative cited a recommendation by the {{w|European Union Aviation Safety Agency}} (EASA).  A recommendation published in a Safety Information Bulletin by the aviation body dated May 25 stated: EASA operators are to "avoid operations in {{w|Flight information region|FIR}} [Flight Information Region] Minsk" unless its use is "deemed necessary", and third country operators "authorised by EASA" do the same "when conducting operations to, from and within the EU" until an international investigation into Protasevich's arrest hasn't completed.

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', {{w|Air France}} was also following an EASA recommendation, and cancelled a flight from [[Paris]] to Moscow for the second consecutive day.  It was denied permission on Wednesday.  Air France has cancelled at least four flights from Paris to Moscow, the [[BBC]] reported.  An Austrian Airlines cargo flight in {{w|Nanjing}}, [[China]] bound for Vienna was also grounded over similar concerns.

''The Guardian'' reported {{w|KLM}} and [[British Airways]]  had modified routes approved.  Along with those air carriers, {{w|RT (TV network)|RT}} also listed {{w|LOT Polish Airlines}}'s modified routes were also approved.

The Foreign Ministry of [[Austria]] called Russia's position "absolutely incomprehensible to us", adding, according to {{w|Deutsche Welle}}, that all flights bound for and over Russia should be able to continue without hindrance.  According to {{w|Interfax}}, when asked by journalists, Russian Press Secretary {{w|Dmitry Peskov}} said "[t]he presidential administration is not in charge of controlling air traffic" and advised the question be posed to "our aviation authorities".

The [[United Nations]] [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] held an "exceptional session" Thursday on the initial grounding, ''The Guardian'' reported.  Belarus is accused of violating the 1944 {{w|Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation}}, to which it is a signatory.

According to a May 25 BBC article, European airlines KLM, [[Lufthansa]], [[Scandinavian Airlines]] and {{w|Finnair}} announced their suspension of flights over Belarusian airspace.  LOT Polish Airlines suspended flights to and from Minsk, and [[Ukraine]] banned all carriers from flying over or into Belarus.  [[Singapore Airlines]] declared rerouting its flights as well.

Belarus' national carrier {{w|Belavia}} has been the subject of many cancellations, including a suspension of its operating permit in the [[United Kingdom]] and its suspension of eleven routes to EU cities and one to the Russian city {{w|Kaliningrad}}.  Belavia also suspended flights to [[France]] and the UK until October 30, the BBC reported.

US, South Korean special envoys explore reopening talks with North Korea at Seoul meeting
{{date|October 27, 2021}}
{{Politics and conflicts}}

On Sunday, [[United States]] and South Korean envoys met in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] to discuss ways to reopen diplomatic talks with [[North Korea]] and sending humanitarian aid there. Earlier, the [[United Nations]] warned the country faces starvation due to the [[COVID-19]] pandemic. Envoys also discussed a Southern proposal to formally end the {{w|Korean War}}, which was not closed since the last {{w|Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice Talks}} in July 1953.

[[File:Ambassador-Sung-Kim-2020.jpg|thumb|left|Kim Sung in 2020.{{image|{{w|US Department of State}}}}]]
Prior to the meeting, {{w|Sung Kim}}, US Special Envoy for North Korea told reporters after arriving in Seoul to meet South Korean nuclear envoy Noh Kyu-duk that he looked forward to "productive follow up discussions" after their meeting in [[Washington, D.C.]] last Tuesday. ​Their agenda for Sunday included the {{w|North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|denuclearization of North Korea}}, declaring a formal end to the Korean War and sending humanitarian aid to North Korea as a way to reopen diplomatic talks.

After the meeting, Kim said the US calls "on the {{tooltip|DPRK|Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)}} to cease… destabilizing activities, and instead, engage in dialogue." He reiterated the US "remain[s] ready to meet with the DPRK without preconditions", and had "made clear that the United States harbors no hostile intent towards the DPRK."

During a press conference Friday, {{w|United Nations Special Rapporteur}} on North Korea {{w|Tomas Ojea Quintana}} said the country may need humanitarian aid and called for easing {{w|Sanctions against North Korea|sanctions}} against the North Korean textile and seafood sectors. He warned that continued border closures and limited trade might lead to starvation, and that the region is "veering towards an {{w|arms race}}".

During a US {{w|Department of State}} press briefing the same day, spokesperson {{w|Ned Price}} said "[UN] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] resolutions regarding the DPRK remain in effect" and "we are involved in efforts to facilitate the provision of humanitarian aid to the neediest" in North Korea.

Last Tuesday, North Korea tested a new type of {{w|submarine-launched ballistic missile|submarine-launched ballistic missile}} (SLBM). In response, special envoy Kim called on the North to "refrain from further provocations and engage in sustained and substantive dialogue". The North's responded the US was "overreacting". South Korea launched a new SLBM on September 15, while North Korea launched a {{w|hypersonic missile}}, in early stages of development, on September 28.

Glasgow Climate Pact deal struck; nations to reduce coal usage
{{date|November 16, 2021}}{{Climate change}}
[[File:Official portrait of Alok Sharma crop 2.jpg|thumb|180px|left|{{w|Alok Sharma}} in 2017.{{image credit|{{w|Chris McAndrew}}}}]]
The {{w|2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference}} (often abbreviated to COP26) has concluded with the signing of the Glasgow Climate Pact. The pact is the first ever deal struck to explicitly plan to reduce coal usage internationally. Coal accounts for around 40% of the world's annual {{w|greenhouse gas}} emissions and is the highest-emitting fossil fuel in terms of greenhouse gases.

However, [[BBC News]] reported that the pledges made still don't go far enough to limit global warming's impact to 1.5 degrees {{w|Celsius}}. According to a 2018 {{w|Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C}}, the differences between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius are profound. While 1.5 degrees would help mitigate the worst effects, even 2 degrees Celsius would exacerbate the impacts of climate change internationally. 

Though it was initially planned for coal to be entirely phased out, India's climate minister, {{w|Bhupender Yadav}}, pointed out that this would not be possible for developing nations where they "have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication". This point refocused the discussion to reduction rather than total elimination at this stage.

COP26 President {{w|Alok Sharma}} said that he was "deeply sorry" for the softening of the pact, stating that it was necessary in order to preserve the deal as a whole. Switzerland's environment minister, {{w|Simonetta Sommaruga}}, expressed her "profound disappointment", commenting that it will "not bring us closer to 1.5C, but make it more difficult to reach it."

Russia launches full-scale invasion against Ukraine
{{Politics and conflicts}}
{{date|February 24, 2022}}
[[File:War in Ukraine (2022) en.png|left|thumb|Map of the initial Russian attacks on Ukraine as of February 24, 2022. {{image|[[c:User:Homoatrox|User:Homoatrox]]}}]]

[[Russia]]n troops began an invasion of [[Ukraine]] by firing missiles at several cities yesterday.

On state television, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] described this as the beginning of a "special military operation" in Ukraine with the aim of "the demilitarization and de-nazification of Ukraine" at 06:00 in [[Moscow]], 03:00 UTC. After this announcement, President of Ukraine [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] imposed martial law nationwide.

Explosions of Russian missiles were heard in cities [[Kyiv]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Donetsk]], {{w|Odessa}} and in the {{w|Donbas|Donbas region}} with the aim of destroying Ukrainian military command centres. Gunfire was also heard near {{w|Boryspil International Airport}}, Kyiv's main airport, and sirens were heard throughout the city.

Putin said that Russia had been left with no choice but to defend itself against what he described were threats from Ukraine after {{w|Russian separatist forces in Donbas|Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk}} sent a plea to Moscow to help stop alleged Ukrainian aggression. The claim was dismissed by the [[United States]] as Russian propaganda.

On Monday, Russia passed a bill recognizing the self-proclaimed {{w|Donetsk People's Republic}} and {{w|Luhansk People's Republic}} in eastern Ukraine as independent states, followed by agreements of friendship, cooperation, and assistance with the republics.
 
[[United Nations]] Secretary General [[Antonio Guterres]] made a plea to Putin to stop the war "in the name of humanity" after Putin announced the military operation.

[[United Kingdom|UK]] Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] has promised the West will respond "decisively" and that Putin had "chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction". The British Defence Secretary {{w|Ben Wallace}} and Foreign Secretary {{w|Liz Truss}} have also condemned the invasion, Truss adding they will "use every lever at our disposal to stop [Putin] in his tracks" and "nothing is off the table".

US President [[Joe Biden]] condemned the attack as "unprovoked and unjustified", adding that he will be meeting with [[G7]] leaders today, and asserting the US and allies "will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia".

President of the [[European Commission]] {{w|Ursula von der Leyen}} also condemned the attack as "unjustified" and added that the {{w|Government of Russia|Kremlin}} would be held accountable.

Spokesperson for the [[China|Chinese]] {{w|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Foreign Ministry}} {{w|Hua Chunying}} said "all parties should work for peace instead of escalating the tension or hyping up the possibility of war", criticizing "those parties who were busy condemning others" for a lack of a supposed reaction.

[[NATO]] Secretary General [[Jens Stoltenberg]] condemned Russia's "reckless and unprovoked attack" on Ukraine and said NATO allies would meet to tackle the consequences of Moscow's "aggressive actions".

Russian forces approach Ukraine's capital Kyiv
{{date|February 26, 2022}}
{{Politics and conflicts}}
[[File:Battle of Ivankiv (2022).png|thumb|left|160px||Map of incursions and strikes {{Image|[[:c:User talk:Viewsridge|Viewsridge]]}}]]
Yesterday, {{w|Russian Armed Forces|Russian forces}} attacked [[Ukraine]]'s capital [[Kyiv]] with missiles resulting in blasts damaging residential areas. [[Russia]] continued its three-pronged invasion of Ukraine and has already reached the {{w|Obolon, Kyiv|Obolon district}} of Kyiv. For the second day, sirens sounded over Kyiv and residents took shelter in underground metro stations.
[[File:Последствия удара ракеты по Голосеевскому району киева (6).jpg|thumb|160px|left|A structure in Kyiv destroyed by a missile strike. {{image credit|[[:c:User talk:Arrikel|Arrikel]]}}]]
The {{w|mayor of Kyiv}}, {{w|Vitali Klitschko}} informed citizens, "saboteurs" had arrived and were fighting in the city's outskirts. [[Moscow]] claimed, it had captured and taken over control of {{w|Hostomel Airport|Antonov International Airport}}, also known as Hostomel Airport, located in the north of Kyiv, using 200 helicopters and paratroopers. Hostomel could be a major staging point for an attack on Kyiv.

The {{w|Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)|Ukrainian Ministry of Defence}} requested its citizens to inform them of Russian troop movements and also suggested to "make Molotov cocktails to neutralise the enemy".

Following several sanctions from the West and its allies, 27 [[European Union]] members announced, they froze assets belonging to {{w|President of Russia|Russian president}} [[Vladimir Putin]] and {{w|Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|foreign minister}} [[Sergey Lavrov]].

Russian forces also advanced into {{w|Chernobyl}} and captured it. The Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhaylo Podolyak said, Chernobyl was captured by Russian forces after a "fierce battle".

At the 8979th meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council]], Russia vetoed a draft resolution which aimed at ending the Ukraine crisis. The resolution had garnered support from 11 of the 15 members and had 3 abstentions.

ICJ orders Russia to stop Ukrainian invasion 'immediately'
{{date|March 18, 2022}}
{{2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine}}
[[File:Zorgvliet, 2517 The Hague, Netherlands - panoramio (13).jpg|left|thumb|The {{w|Peace Palace}} in [[The Hague]], the [[Netherlands]], the seat of the ICJ. {{image credit|Ben Bender}}]]
On Wednesday, the {{w|International Court of Justice}} (ICJ) directed [[Russia]] to "immediately suspend the military operations" in [[Ukraine]] in a 13–2 vote of representatives. The ruling against the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine]] was opposed by Russia and [[China]].

Ukraine filed the case on February 26, two days after the Russian invasion began. Russia justified the incursion as a special military operation to protect Russian groups in {{w|Eastern Ukraine}} from {{w|genocide}}, which Ukraine says is unfounded. During the hearing, Russia insisted "it was acting in self-defense".

Ukrainian representative to the ICJ {{w|Anton Korynevych}} demanded "Russia must be stopped". Ukraine said the [[United Nations]] {{w|Genocide Convention}} doesn't permit invasion as defense against genocide, and denied committing or planning any such acts.

The court ruled in Ukraine's favor. It reasoned, "the civilian population affected by the present conflict is extremely vulnerable. The 'special military operation' being conducted by the Russian Federation has resulted in numerous civilian deaths and injuries."

Ukrainian President [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] hailed the victory on [[Twitter]]: "Ukraine gained a complete victory in its case". He also wrote: "Ignoring the order will isolate Russia even further."

Russia had earlier boycotted the ICJ hearing with a March 7 filing saying the court lacks jurisdiction on the matter. Even though the ICJ ruled in favor of Ukraine, it has no executive right to enforce the verdict.

Russia's military continues to strike Ukrainian cities and destroy civilian structures. The {{w|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}} reported that about 3 million Ukrainians had taken refuge in nearby countries since the invasion.

Former US Secretary of State Albright dies aged 84
{{date|March 24, 2022}}
{{Obituaries}}
[[File:DIG14482rb04 (46659869595) (1).jpg|thumb|left|Albright at the {{w|University of Texas at Austin|University of}} [[Texas]] at {{w|Austin, Texas|Austin}} on April 9, 2019. {{image|[https://www.flickr.com/people/100836534@N04 LBJ Library]}}]]

Former [[United States]] Secretary of State {{w|Madeleine Albright}} was announced to have died at the age of 84 from [[cancer]] in a statement released by her family on Wednesday.

Albright was the first female US Secretary of State from 1997 to 2001 under President [[Bill Clinton]]. Before that, she was the US Ambassador to the [[United Nations]] from 1993 to 1997.

Current President [[Joe Biden]] ordered flags at the [[White House]] and all federal buildings to be flown at half mast. He said he "will always remember [Albright's] fervent faith that 'America is the indispensable nation.'" Biden further added: "As the world redefined itself in the wake of the {{w|Cold War}}, we were partners and friends working to welcome newly liberated democracies."

Bill and [[Hillary Clinton]] said in a joint statement: "As a child in [[World War II|war-torn]] [[Europe]], Madeleine and her family were twice forced to flee their home [...] When the end of the Cold War ushered in a new era of global interdependence, she became America's voice at the UN, then took the helm at the State Department, where she was a passionate force for freedom, democracy, and human rights."

Former President [[George W. Bush]] said she "understood first-hand the importance of free societies for peace in our world."

Albright was born Marie Jana Korbelová in 1937 in [[Prague]], which was then part of the {{w|First Czechoslovak Republic}}. Her family went into exile in 1939 after the country was {{w|Occupation of Czechoslovakia (1938–1945)|occupied}} by {{w|Nazi Germany|Nazi}} [[Germany]], arriving in the United States in 1948.

On Friday, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) elected former Prime Minister of [[Togo]] {{w|Gilbert Houngbo}} its next director general, the first [[Africa]]n to serve the role since the organization was founded in 1919.

Houngbo, aged 61, was elected via secret ballot by the [[United Nations]] agency’s 56-member governing body in the second round with 30 votes. The runner-up was former [[France|French]] Minister of Labor {{w|Muriel Pénicaud}}, who received 23 votes.  Former [[South Korea|South Korean]] foreign minister {{w|Kang Kyung-wha}} received two votes and [[South Africa|South African]] businessman Mthunzi Mdwaba received one. 

The current deputy director-general, [[Australia]]n Greg Vines, was eliminated in the first round.

The ILO governing body is composed of government, employee, and employer representatives from its 187 member states. It decides the ILO's policy, sets its agenda, and elects the director-general.

Houngbo was previously deputy director-general of the ILO from 2013 to 2017, and currently leads the {{w|International Fund for Agricultural Development}} (IFAD).  He will succeed {{w|Guy Ryder}} as director-general from October 1, 2022.

Ukraine's Zelenskyy accuses Russia of war crimes in address to UN
{{date|April 7, 2022}}
{{2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine}}
[[File:Місто Буча після звільнення від російських окупантів 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ukraine-published video still allegedly depicting dead civilians in Bucha, dated April 3. {{image|{{w|Ukrinform}}}}]]
On Tuesday, [[Ukraine]]'s President [[Volodymyr Zelenskyy]] accused [[Russia]] of committing [[war crime]]s against civilians during [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|the ongoing invasion]] via live video feed to the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]].

Zelenskyy said: "The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country. They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone who is alive. They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies." Demanding the perpetrators and their superiors be brought before a war crimes tribunal and held accountable, he specified: "They cut off limbs, cut their throats. Women were raped and killed in front of their children."

Russian ambassador to the UN {{w|Vasily Nebenzya}} repeated that the {{w|Government of Russia}} denies the allegations. He asserted that video footage was a "crude forgery" arranged by Ukraine. "You only saw what they showed you. The only ones who would fall for this are Western dilettantes," he said.

Ukraine said it found hundreds of dead bodies, notably in {{w|Bucha, Kyiv Oblast|Bucha}}, after forces reclaimed areas outside capital city [[Kyiv]]. {{w|Iryna Venediktova}}, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, said on Sunday that 410 bodies were found in areas around Kyiv, telling [[Reuters]]: "We need to work with witnesses" to assess the extent of the crimes. "People today are so stressed that they are physically unable to speak," she said.

[[File:DestroyedcarinBucha.png|thumb|left|Ukraine-released video still allegedly depicting a car crushed by a tank with a driver (blurred) inside in Bucha, dated April 2. {{image|{{w|National Police of Ukraine}}}}]]

On Sunday, Zelenskyy accused Russia of seeking: "The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine." Asked if it was {{w|genocide}} on [[CBS]] program ''{{w|Face the Nation}}'', Zelenskyy said: "Indeed. This is genocide." Ukraine released images depicting people shot in the back of the head, many with their hands tied behind their backs.

The Russian {{w|Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defence}} issued a statement on Monday reading: "During the time that [Bucha] has been under the control of the Russian armed forces, not a single local resident has suffered from any violent action. Russian servicemen have delivered and distributed 452 tonnes of humanitarian aid to civilians in [the] {{w|Kyiv Oblast|Kyiv Region}}." The statement claimed photographs were a hoax and "provocations of Ukrainian radicals."

Satellite photography over Bucha from {{w|Maxar Technologies}} appeared to show dead bodies in the same positions for weeks, as well as a mass grave at the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints. According to [[CNN]], people were hoping to find their relatives in the grave which may contain upwards of a 150 people.

Nevertheless, Russia's Director of the Information {{w|Maria Zakharova}}, denied the legitimacy of footage from Bucha. "Who are the masters of provocation? Of course the [[United States]] and [[NATO]]," she said, saying the outrage was a planned attempt to tarnish Russia's reputation.

International responses were issued earlier this week despite Russia's stance. [[United Kingdom]] foreign minister {{w|Liz Truss}} said: "Britain has helped lead the way with sanctions to cripple the Putin war machine. We will do more to ramp up the pressure on Russia and we will keep pushing others to do more".

US Secretary of State [[Antony Blinken]] joined: "We’re tightening the existing sanctions. We’re adding new ones. We’re doing it in full coordination with Europeans and other partners around the world. And one of the results is that the Russian economy is reeling."

"You can expect further sanctions announcements this week. And we are coordinating with our allies and partners on what the exact parameters of that will be," added US security advisor {{w|Jake Sullivan}}.

Albania blames Iran for cyberattacks
{{date|September 12, 2022}}
{{Albania}}
[[File:Albanian Prime Minister Rama (51243860092) (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Edi Rama at a signing ceremony in [[Brussels]], 2021. {{image|{{w|United States Department of State|US Department of State}}}}]]
On Saturday [[Albania]]'s Interior Ministry blamed [[Iran|Iranian]] actors for a {{w|cyberattack}} on Friday evening which targeted the {{w|Albanian Police|national police's}} computer systems. Albania reported a previous attack in July.

The ministry said in a statement "[t]he national police’s computer systems were hit Friday by a cyberattack which, according to initial information, was committed by the same actors who in July attacked the country’s public and government service systems". The attack comes days after Iran was blamed for the attack in July. The statement also said the authorities had deliberately closed down their border crossing management software "[i]n order to neutralise the criminal act and secure the systems", with local media reporting queues at border crossings.

On Wednesday the Albanian Prime Minister {{w|Edi Rama}} accused Iran of directing the attack against Albanian institutions on July 15, stating it was a bid to "paralyse public services and hack data and electronic communications from the government systems". While Rama went on to say that the attack failed in its purpose, he also stated that Albania was severing diplomatic ties with Iran, giving Iranian embassy staff 24 hours to leave the country. The [[Associated Press]] called this the first known case of diplomatic ties being cut over a cyberattack.

Iran called the accusations "baseless" and deemed the cutting of diplomatic ties to be "ill-considered and short-sighted".

On Friday the [[US]] imposed sanctions against the {{w|Ministry of Intelligence (Iran)|Iranian intelligence agency}} in response to the July attack. [[NATO]], of which Albania is a member, and the [[European Union]] also denounced the attack.

Iran and Albania have been foes since 2013 when Albania agreed to host members of the {{w|People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran|People’s Mujahedeen of Iran}}, also known as Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MEK), at the request of the US and [[United Nations]]. MEK is an Iranian opposition group, and considered a terrorist group by Iran.

United Nations denounces Russian annexation of Ukrainian territories
{{date|October 16, 2022}}
[[File:Vladimir Putin addresses the United Nations General Assembly 01.JPG|thumb|left|Putin addresses the General Assembly on September 28, 2015. {{image|{{w|Kremlin.ru}}}}]]
{{United Nations}}

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted 143-5 Wednesday to reprimand [[Russia]] for its October 5 annexation of four regions of what is internationally recognized as [[Ukraine]].

During [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia's ongoing invasion]], forces held four {{w|referendum|referenda}} on the prospect of joining Russia in four Ukrainian ''oblasts'' (provinces) that were widely condemned as illegal. On October 5, President [[Vladimir Putin]] passed legislation incorporating the territories. 

Text from the resolution, first presented before the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] September 30, declares the referenda and annexations "illegal" and urges Russia to "immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces." Mediation through "political dialogue, negotiation, mediation and other peaceful means" were encouraged, but nations were pressed to "refrain from any action that might be interpreted as recognizing" changes to Ukraine's territorial extent.

The original text was authored by [[Albania]] and the [[United States]], and failed due to Russia's veto power in the Security Council. [[Moscow]] had attempted to make the General Assembly vote through {{w|secret ballot}} to grant [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned nations]] "flexibility and breathing space" in choosing sides, but the General Assembly rejected the motion.

143 nations voted for the resolution, while 35 abstained, 11 did not vote, and four, with Russia ([[Belarus]], [[Nicaragua]], [[North Korea]] and [[Syria]]), voted against.

Troops freed by Mali return to Ivory Coast
{{date|January 10, 2023}}
[[File:Assimi Goita, August 2021.png|thumb|left|Goita on August 19, 2021. {{image|[[Voice of America]]}}]]
{{Politics and conflicts}}

On Saturday, 46 [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] troops, freed after six months' detention in [[Mali]] on mercenary charges, returned to the Ivorian capital of [[Abidjan]] a day after their pardon. The soldiers were detained since July on charges of 'undermining state security' in the Malian capital {{w|Bamako}}, sparking a row between the neighbouring countries. The Ivory Coast has argued the troops were there as part of a [[UN]] mission to fight militant Islamists.

Their pardon by Mali's military leader {{w|Assimi Goïta}} followed an Ivorian delegation travelling to Mali and mediation by [[Togo]]'s President {{w|Faure Gnassingbe}}. The Malian government thanked Gnassingbe for his involvement.

Mali's relations with other West [[Africa]]n countries were strained after a military coup d'état toppled elected President {{w|Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta}} in August 2020. Abidjan has been a vocal critic of the coup.

The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (Ecowas), of which the Ivory Coast is a member, had proposed new sanctions to begin January 1 if the troops were not freed.

Ecowas previously levied punitive sanctions against Mali after Goïta delayed elections promised in February 2021 by four years. They were lifted in July 2022 after Malian leaders proposed a two-year transition to democracy.

Relations with Western powers have also become strained as Mali has strengthened ties with [[Russia]] to fight militant Islamists active across the region. [[France]] formally ended its operation to fight insurgents in the {{w|Sahel}} in November 2022. The [[UK]] has also announced the withdrawal of troops from Mali.
